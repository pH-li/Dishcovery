60989,30081,2003-07-10,5,"Oh my goodness! This was wonderful, yummy and so easy! I was thinking about gyros all day, but didn't have any lamb. Luckily I found this recipe, and am so glad that I did! I quickly used the leftovers to make myself another pita for lunch tomorrow... unless I eat it before then... it's just that good! Thanks so much! :)"
98919,30081,2003-09-21,5,"Tried your Gyros today and thought they were out of this world.  I served them with Pita bread, grilled onions, grated cheese, lettuce and black olives.  The Cucumber/Yogurt Dip went so well with it.  Thanks for sharing!!"
46660,30081,2004-06-02,5,These were very good!  I made the ground beef into pita sized patties like someone else did.  They reminded me of falafels in flavor and texture.  The cucumber yogurt sauce was delicious!
39835,30081,2005-08-26,3,"These were good for sandwich night, but I found the hamburgers  a bit dry and hard to slice, but I may have left them in the broiler too long. I also bought the wrong kind of pitas - bought Greek pita bread instead of the other kind, so we just added everything on the pita and rolled them up like burritoes -- good and fillling. I also found the dressing a bit too different for our tastes - maybe next time I'll try it with sour cream instead of yogurt. These were good for a change of pace, but I think we'll go back to traditional hamburgers.  Thanks for sharing!"
158086,30081,2006-08-23,5,This was very easy and tasted wonderful...my better half ate all the patties and declared it a winner in his book.
53932,30081,2006-09-08,4,"I used ground turkey and thought the spices were just right (except the salt, which I think was a bit much so next time will add it after cooking).  "
358796,30081,2006-11-13,3,"Liked it, but probably would not make again as written. The cucumber sauce was a little bland, I'd leave out the sugar and do a mixture of half yogurt, half sour cream and then add some dill or mint w/a splash of lemon. The meat really held together nicely on the grill, and sliced perfectly so it looked really good presentation-wise, but it needed a flavor adjustment, maybe a Greek seasoning mix... something w/marjoram, lemon & pepper in addition to the other spices. This did smell very good when it came off the grill, and is a good alternative to a hamburger."
307214,30081,2006-12-04,5,Only made the filling.  We all loved it.
236170,30081,2007-03-20,4,A great meal for the summer when you don't want to use your oven!
331557,30081,2007-06-07,3,The cucumber sauce was very good.  I increased the garlic to 4 and it was the best tzaziki-type sauce I have had in a long time.  I wasn't overly crazy about the gyros themselves with ground beef - I think they would be much better with chicken and will modify accordingly next time.  Thanks for sharing.
137911,30081,2007-06-26,5,"Wow, this is a terrific recipe for Gyros.  I wanted to use ground beef as ground lamb is so expensive and hard to find around here.  You couldn't tell the difference in the taste!  I think the oregano and garlic were the key.  I almost added real onion instead of onion powder and am glad I didn't. Real onion would have made the meat too loose to cut into slices.  Instead of making burger patties, I made it into one long low loaf and baked it in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes.  Came out perfect.  It was nice and dense and as a result was very easy to slice for the sandwiches. The cucumber sauce was delish.  I also used Recipe #79388 for the pita bread as it's such a delicious bread for gyros.  My 11 year old dd was in heaven eating this.  Thank you for posting.  It will be a repeat in our home."
350750,37413,2012-04-19,5,Finally made these and they were a hit.  Thank You!
497077,30081,2007-12-26,5,"WONDERFUL!!! I have made several times and they are always soooo good. Have also made w/ ground turkey. I like to add a pinch of thyme, cinnamon,and allspice to the filling. For the sauce, I use greek yogurt (thicker), omit the sugar, and add a little evoo, salt, and lemon juice. I use my George Foreman Grill and they are perfect everytime! I serve w/ roasted potatoes seasoned w/ greek seasoning and you can't ask for anything better-yum!!!"
312577,30081,2008-01-03,5,"I like garlic and lemon so I added both to the meat seasoning and yogurt sauce.  Also, after reading the reviews I decided to spice up the meat with cumin, paprika and added an egg and bread crumbs to help the meat adhere together. I know I changed the recipe to suit our personal tastes, but I think that this is a good recipe and thank you for posting it."
180090,30081,2008-01-23,5,This made a great meal and was quick to make. I liked the yogurt sauce..very tasty. I over-cooked the beef a little on the stovetop but it was still great. Thanks for posting this!
286851,30081,2008-02-09,4,"I made this recipe for dinner this evening, and it was a success. My husband and I both enjoyed it, and even our picky little 2 and 4 year old girls ate the meat from it (they aren't too big into the sandwich concept). Tastes a good deal like traditional gyro meat. I used ground sirloin (90% lean). Since it is winter, I broiled the meat in the oven--about 4-5 minutes. Sauce was tasty, and I did not find it overly sweet at all, as a few have mentioned. A nice accompaniment to the gyro. An easy meal to put together, and I will be making it again. Thanks for sharing."
185285,30081,2008-02-13,5,"I had saved this recipe a while back and am so glad I got around to making it! I opted for lean ground turkey. I'd never had a Gyro before, but DH was 'more than impressed' that I had got the seasonings right b/c they tasted just like the ones he orders while up in NYC.  Thanks Cyrene, these are great and quick!  I did notice that the yogurt sauce was much better the 2nd day after sitting, so going forward I'd likely make it ahead of time."
176615,30081,2008-06-06,5,"Great recipe! Superfast and easy, the whole family enjoyed them. Wrapped some flatbread in foil and heated on the grill while the meat was cooking. Will make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
191533,30081,2008-06-12,5,"Yum! Served on wheat tortillas! The seasoning in the meat is great! I served them for our main meal, and feel that this recipe serves 4, not 12. I added salt to the sauce, too."
470351,30081,2008-12-20,5,"We absolutely LOVED this and it totally tasted like eating an authentic Gyro!  I was SUPER skeptical about this recipe since I'm used to lamb gyros but I had a craving and had the beef...so I gave it a shot.  I increased all seasoning in the beef by quite a bit (eyeballed it) and used Recipe #51983 (which was EXCELLENT!) for the Tzatziki.  We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!  My husband tasted the beef without the sauce and felt it tasted like a plain burger to him.  I think you definitely want the sauce and the fillings to make this a true tasting Gyro.  I served this with sliced onions and sliced tomatoes.  No lettuce since I've never seen it served with lettuce in any of the restaurants I've eaten it in.  GREAT recipe and will definitely make again.  Thank you !"
251626,30081,2009-06-28,4,These were really good. I think next time I may try them with donair sauce instead. Thanks.
185926,30081,2009-05-10,4,"Very good.  The yogurt sauce was excellent.  The meat was a little bland.  I had trouble slicing it.  Maybe my knife was not sharp enough.  However, we enjoyed the meal very much.  THANK YOU."
13483,30081,2009-07-08,5,"I did a buffet style dinner and this was the main meat course.  I fried up the ground beef with the spices rather than cut up cooked burgers (made it easier I think). I served them with the added goodies in a form of hot dog bun.  This was much easier than trying to stuff a pita!!  I made the ""sauce"" with added mint and lemon juice, the day before.  All in all a great little dish I doubled for 8 people.  Very little left overs too.  Thanks Cyrene"
579298,30081,2009-08-09,4,We really enjoyed this dish! I doubled the sauce and used the leftovers as a salad dressing - yum!
350750,30081,2009-08-28,5,My husband and I really enjoyed this.  It was tasty and easy.  Next time I'll leave out the sugar in the yogurt. Thanks for a different tasty meal!
637486,30081,2010-01-03,5,"I have been making these for a couple of years now, and I can't believe that I never rated it!  These have a really authentic Gyro taste and I really enjoy it served with tzatziki sauce, spinach, and tomatoes on a pita.  To save time and effort, I skip the step of forming into patties and just brown the ground beef and add seasonings."
140132,30081,2010-01-16,5,We all loved these.  I will makethis often this summer.  Its a great way to enjoy burgers tahts different from the ordinary burgers on a bun.  thank you for sharing.
269331,30081,2016-04-25,5,"I used ground turkey.  I used the suggestion from other reviewers and slammed the meat mixture on the counter for about 5-10 minutes to make it dense.  WOW, it was a winner in our house hold.  I did spruce up the cucumber sauce."
847160,30081,2010-07-05,3,that was ok
76951,30081,2010-09-05,5,"Great for a low fat version!  I also doubled the spices and used ground turkey instead of hamburger and Fat Free Sour Cream instead of yogurt (that's what I had on hand).  I also added 1/4 tsp of dried dill to the gyro sauce.  I will definitely be making this again instead of giving in to the high fat of lamb gyros.  Thanks, Cyrene, for a great alternative."
145352,30081,2011-02-13,5,"Wow, we loved this. I double the whole thing and served them on homemade naan-type bread. Great!"
126440,30081,2012-06-30,5,Loved it! Used Recipe #79388 for the pita.
285039,30081,2013-05-20,4,"Very easy and tasty weekday meal.  I cheated and made them more like ground beef tacos, so I am not rating on meat consistency, but flavor.  I found them a tad too peppery and might cut it in half next time.  The sauce does help cool down the spiciness though.  Will definitely make these again!"
199020,30081,2013-07-02,5,"Delicious! Since a lot of reviewers were complaining about the hamburger taste, I added half of a ground zucchini to the meat. It turned out great! I also made homemade flour tortillas #204109, which are better than pitas any store bought tortillas. For the sauce, I used recipe # 129930 since I had all of its ingredients on hand. The only other change I made was to add feta cheese. It came together well! Next time I&#039;ll add banana peppers and kalamata olives. Thanks!"
1072593,30081,2015-05-09,5,"I love the challenge of a new recipe...staying busy, plotting and planning.
It makes me forget that I&#039;m growing older.  Speaking of older, where was I...ohhh the gyro...this one&#039;s a real keeper!"
839492,30081,2016-03-14,4,"Rating is for the meat only; I made these into meatballs and baked in the oven. I think next time I will add a little cinnamon and allspice to include those yummy Greek flavors of the Gyros I love. Served over spinach with kalamata olives, sliced onion and topped with Feta Dill Greek Yogurt dressing. Delish! Thanks for sharing."
847160,79944,2008-10-09,3,that was ok ...but to pasty for me
28649,26110,2002-10-27,5,This were a bit hit with my family.  I used a food processor to make them and had no problems at all.  This was the first time I made homemade biscuits and will continue to make them from this recipe again and again.  Thanks for sharing.
8688,26110,2003-03-06,5,"Excellent recipe for delicious and fabulous results! Buttery flavor, light and flaky, these biscuits will be a hit at your next breakfast, fried chicken or ham supper!  Very simple recipe and easy to follow directions. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!"
35526,26110,2003-07-20,5,Beautiful biscuits.  I served hot with butter and hot pepper jelly for a late Sunday brunch.  They were light and fluffy and tasted great.  Excellent instructions and tips!
60260,26110,2003-08-29,4,"The biscuits turned out well and for being inexperienced in the biscuit department the instructions were clear. After eating too many biscuits in a ""can"" I'm used to a sweeter taste and might think about a bit of sugar or maybe regular butter like someone else suggested."
39835,26110,2003-10-31,4,"Good biscuits which we enjoyed  but they didn't rise much, however I did decrease the baking powder to 2 teaspoons (I usually decrease baking powder and soda due to high altitude) and next time I will use the specified amount. However these were super easy using the food processor and we will be making these again. Thanks for sharing!"
52543,26110,2004-01-11,5,"Light & fluffy & a very easy to follow recipe! I scaled the recipe in half with no problems at all, served with dinner dinner last night & we will finish off at breakfast this morning. Thanx Mean Chef!"
56087,26110,2004-08-31,5,"Yet another winner recipe from Mean Chef.  I've already made these twice, and I thought my biscuit recipe was killer.. this one wins hands down.  Thanks for sharing."
95743,26110,2004-10-20,5,"So good, Dh has hidden the leftovers so he can have ALL of them for his breakfast tomorrow. Darn."
176615,26110,2005-05-26,5,"Wonderful biscuits! What really sets this recipe apart are the detailed directions and very easy prep using a food processor. Served with homemade blackberry jam and honey butter, also eggs, bacon and grits for a real treat. Thanks, P4, for a keeper!"
222433,26110,2006-11-15,5,Hands down the best biscuit recipe I have ever made! The family absolutely loved them! Thanks P4!
402559,26110,2007-01-06,5,"Light, fluffy and a great flavor. Thanks."
97579,26110,2007-01-14,5,"I never made homemade biscuits before and these were very tasty.  I made them to accompany my Chicken Chili Recipe #129958 for a lunch with some girlfriends.  They were great dipped in the chili.  We also took out some honey and drizzled honey all over them and then of course I had butter out and we all know how good butter is on biscuits!  So we ate them 3 different ways at one sitting.  I also used my new stand mixer to mix these and it turned out perfect.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I did the milk & lemon thing.  I also patted the dough into a square and cut the biscuits in squares so I wouldn't have to handle the dough to much like I would have had to if I made circles (with the leftovers).  Will definately make again!"
128473,26110,2007-02-05,5,"These are by far the best buttermilk biscuits that I have tried on Zarr so far.  Wow! they are so tender that they melt in your mouth. The biscuits are light and airy,  rose nice and big, were crispy on the outside and tender and soft on the inside. I served the warm biscuits with Bev's Orange Honey Butter. I'm still in heaven, was it breakfast or dessert, I'm not sure, but I'll definitely be using the rest of the biscuits tonight for our strawberry shortcake. P4, thanks so much for sharing your quick and easy to make recipe."
461834,26110,2007-03-19,5,"WOW!!!Thank you P4 for this recipe!!!  Using the food processor made such a difference and, needless to say, cut way back on the time needed to make biscuits.  These tasted fantastic."
280166,26110,2007-06-28,5,"These were easy to work with and tasted wonderful! I made some into sausage, egg and cheese biscuits and my super picky kids declared them better than Mickie D's! I too patted the dough into a rectangle and cut into squares. Thanks for posting!  UPDATE:  I tripled this recipe and patted them into a 10 X 15 jelly roll pan.  Perfect size and perfect rise!"
400420,26110,2007-12-29,5,"These biscuits are really great!  I've been trying to learn how to make biscuits, since my DH loves biscuits and gravy and DD just loves biscuits!  We had been buying the bags of frozen buttermilk biscuits for years and I finally decided that they are way too expensive since we eat them so often.  Every time I make these they get better.  Thanks for such a great recipe!"
173579,26110,2008-01-16,5,Very nice biscuits.  Thanks for posting.
64203,26110,2008-02-17,5,"Light as air! These tender, flaky, melt in your mouth delicious biscuits are about as good as you can get! I used my food processor too and it made these a cinch to put together. The dough is very easy to work with and the result is an amazing biscuit! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe."
132383,26110,2008-07-26,5,I just got through making these in my food processor and I couldn't believe how fast and easy this was.  I got nine out of the batch so I am freezing four them to see how they bake up from frozen.  I am so happy to have any easy and impressive recipe for when guests are over!
250031,26110,2008-08-14,5,"OMG I finally made perfect biscuits! I made a little change from another recipe because I don't have access to a southern flour like White Lily. I used 1-1/4 cups cake flour and 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. And I used heavy cream with 1 TBL of vinegar as I had no buttermilk. I used the food processor (gasp!). I used kosher salt and next time, I'll only use 1/2 tsp as they were a tad salty. They were so light and fluffy and high! Done in 10 minutes. Oh, thank you! My life is complete (well, now I have to master pancakes, lol)."
324621,26110,2008-11-06,4,"These came out very good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Smart Balance in place of butter, as I always do. My biscuits turned out a bit salty...not sure why but next time I make these I will probably only use 1/2 t. salt. These were a great accompaniment to our Braised Herb Chicken and vegetable dinner!"
532289,26110,2008-11-09,5,"OH MY GOSH!!!!  I have been trying to bake the perfect biscuit for 17 years and believe me I have tried many unsuccessful recipes.  These were light, fluffy, and speckled with little golden spots of color as they came out of the oven at exactly 10 minutes.  I didn't have baking powder without aluminum so I used regular.  Also, I was out of buttermilk so I put a T of vinegar in a cup and added enough milk to make a cup and let it sit for 10 minutes.  I will make these again with real buttermilk.  Thank you so much P4 for telling us not to use a rolling pin.  I am sure that is the reason for my many failures.  (I have always worked biscuit dough kind of like bread dough).  I took the advice of Luvbakin and pressed my dough into a square and cut that into squares.  I placed them close together on a baking sheet and ended up with the best biscuits I have ever made.  I served these with ""Sausage Gravy and Biscuits"" by Kelly Cameron found on this site.  Thank you so much for sharing this delightful recipe."
353131,26110,2008-11-10,5,"WOW! I make pretty good biscuits,being from the Appalachians,but your trick of using the food processor is great! What a simple way to guarantee everything being evenly distributed!!!"
485151,26110,2009-02-13,5,Great biscuits! I used a substitute for the buttermilk- reconstituted dry milk soured with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. They turned out great!
126440,26110,2009-03-30,5,Great biscuits.  I haven't made biscuits in a long time.  I used my food processor and was very easy to make.  Flavor is great and DH keeps eating the rest of them for a snack.  I only got eight but used my Eng. muffin cutter so they were a little bigger.
1072593,26110,2009-04-06,5,You have no idea how many biscuit recipes I've tried resulting from pure disaster to mediocre.  These were moist and buttery yet light in texture.  Technique is half the success of the recipe and I think I've got it with your clear instructions.  Two thumbs up from all family members.
368078,26110,2009-04-25,5,"Yummy!!  these biscuits are wonderful.  We make them often, and they always turn out great.  Thanks, P4"
58836,26110,2009-12-29,5,This is my new biscuit recipe.  I cut the salt back and patted into a square as other reviewers had done and they turned out wonderful!  Then last night I made them with cheese.  Needed a bit more cheese but they were very good.
140132,26110,2010-01-06,4,"Wow, these are so good.  I have tried to make biscuits before and they turned out more like hockey pucks instead of something edible.  I was a little leary about trying these but decieded I needed to try.  I am so glad I did.  Your instructions were very clear and precise.  Thank you for posting this recipe, I, for one, and very very happy."
620763,26110,2010-03-01,4,Very tasty biscuit. We all enjoyed them.
1133190,26110,2010-05-30,5,Awesome and easy! I ate four of them at dinner. Enough said.
142367,26110,2010-06-18,5,As easy as its gets and very yummy besides.  Thank you for sharing.
810787,26110,2010-07-20,5,"I have never made biscuits before, but I must say these were so easy I'm wondering why I ever bought them in a can."
145352,26110,2011-02-26,0,"These worked perfectly. Very easy, and were eaten up quickly. Served with butter and honey."
808027,26110,2011-03-25,5,Perfect biscuits!
394077,26110,2011-05-11,5,"I really like the flavor of these biscuits.  UPDATE:  I made these again today and this time I brushed some butter on the biscuits before baking them  They came out so tender, soft, flakey and the flavor is awesome."
529278,26110,2011-09-14,4,"I didn't have unbleached flour or baking powder without aluminum.  I'll have to try it again with those two things and see if it makes a difference.  Even so, these had a great texture to them.  I'd like them to be twice as thick, so we're going to try again and not press them as flat.  I hope they keep the same great texture then.  I also think some butter on top or a little extra salt would be good.  This wasn't exactly what I was hoping, but this is best biscuit recipe we've tried by far."
1179225,26110,2011-12-10,5,"Perfection! This is one of those recipes you save and use forever. We have no need to try another biscuit recipe. DH made these and followed your recipe on down the line. They came out light, fluffy, tasty and tall! We seved them with sausage gravy for a heavenly Saturday morning breakfat. Thanks so much for sharing this amazing recipe!"
199020,26110,2012-02-04,0,"This is the first time I've attempted made-from-scratch biscuits, so I'm not going to rate this recipe. Mine didn't turn out at all. I followed the instructions and tried to handle the dough as little as possible. The biscuits didn't rise from the 1/2 inch I cut them at. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I think I'll stick to frozen biscuits from now on."
195589,26110,2013-04-15,5,"Just made these tonight and they were delish!  I must be getting old because I didn&#039;t use the food processor, just did it the old-fashioned way. I also freeze my butter and grate it on the largest holes. My sis had hers with butter and honey, I had 1 with country gravy, then another with butter and preserves. (my dessert)  Thanks for posting!"
350750,26110,2014-03-13,5,"Another 5 stars from this family.  I&#039;m glad it only made 12 otherwise I would have been snacking on these all night.  I used a cheese grater on frozen butter, seemed to be easier, with great fluffy results.  Thank you!"
894666,26110,2015-11-12,5,"I have made your recipe countless times, make exactly as stated except I usually don&#039;t bother patting dough out, just drop and shape mounds onto a pizza stone to save mess on counter, the kids gobble these so fast I don&#039;t need them to be pretty! These come together so easy, I make these when I don&#039;t have time for regular rolls. Thank you for what has become a weekly recipe in my rotation."
98919,26110,2016-03-04,5,"UPDATE: Nov. 6, 2015 Although the first time I made these I would say they were great but the 2nd time, they were by far the best I have ever made. I used frozen butter and let it sit out 10 minutes or so, just enough where I could cut it into chunks. Also the food processor is key I think. They were flaky and so awesome!!

1st Review: My 13 year old granddaughter wanted biscuits and gravy and we picked this recipe. Delicious!! Thank you!!"
1581225,26110,2016-11-20,3,"I made these exactly as written. I'd never tried biscuits before, as being from Australia, they are not a common thing. We do have the similar but sweet British scones, which are served with jam and cream. I used the food processor like the author, and found it to be easy. I did find the wet dough hard to work with as it kept sticking to my hands. I'd be grateful for any tips on this. I was also not sure if you are supposed to flatten the dough again between each fold. Like another reviewer stated, the ones I pieced together from the leftover dough turned out better than the first ones, which makes me think that a little kneading may be ok. I may have flattened the dough a little too much before cutting because mine weren't super tall. This may have partly been due to the cutter I used which was a Tupperware double sided one, where it has two different sized circles on each side. I used the bigger side, but it probably pressed the cut rounds down too much. I know an old trick with scones is to actually use a small drinking glass to cut the rounds and keep them nice and high. Mine cooked a little too fast, which I was prepared for as my oven runs hot. The taste was buttery and savoury, which was strange being used to sweet scones, but not unpleasant. This recipe is probably not something I'll make again but I enjoyed trying them."
60989,59636,2003-06-11,5,WOW! I am 8 again!! And they taste as good as I remember! Sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.
37868,59636,2003-08-25,4,Thank You ..you helped me surpise my daughter. Well for that fact my hubby. I ended up making 30 of these. We added more sugar and then on the last batch we added cinnamon with the sugar. They were gone in a flash. Thank You for helping me make my daughter and hubby happy. Easy and fast and fresh. Hugs to you
101823,59636,2004-01-12,4,"This is one of my husband's favorite treats.  We use cheap buttermilk biscuits and cut them in half to shorten cook time.  (I think that they are better when just golden...I don't like the outside to be too hard.)  I also use peanut oil for most deep frying.  It does not impart a greasy taste on the foods.  I know that you can glaze these, or use cinnamon and sugar...I love them just like this."
100526,59636,2004-01-25,5,This was so much fun to make. My family loved them with  sugar and cinnamon mixed. YUM! Thanks
101034,59636,2004-05-01,5,"Step 7 says to cool the donuts!!! I don't think so!!! DH and myself were like two little kids, we just couldn't wait to eat them. I had a few cans of biscuits that were soon to expire, so thought I'd try these. WOW!! Are they great. Very addicting too. I put them in my deep fryer and they were done in no time at all. Thanks for a great recipe AuntWoofie"
189475,59636,2005-05-05,5,Mmmm...These were very yummy! They really do taste like the ones they have at the Chinese buffets. And they were very simple to make.
222055,59636,2005-09-22,0,I made these when I was but a wee little child. I can't remember who told me how to do it but I think it was my Granny! I remember that they were very good!
242484,59636,2005-09-28,5,Awesome! My kids loved them glazed with powdered sugar & milk!
278113,59636,2006-01-12,5,"Been making these all my life....so yummy!! We always used the lid from the vanilla extract bottle to pop out the holes. Oh man, I am hungry just thinking about making them again!!!"
173314,59636,2006-01-18,5,kids loves these!!! thanks
187281,59636,2006-05-15,5,What's not to love? I use a melon baller to make the center hole and then fry in a deep fryer for a few minutes.  My family loves these!
218535,59636,2006-09-23,5,Just like the Chinese Buffet Donuts. Perfect!
230557,59636,2006-11-22,5,"Thanks :) You're right, this is a great donut recipe to use with ""Grow Your Own MAGIC Donuts"" (Recipe #189254), as long as the kids really are sound asleep,lol.  We've made donuts using both biscuits and thawed roll dough - it's fun to put the sugar in a bag & shake, shake, shake your donuts!"
248023,59636,2007-07-20,4,My mom used to make these for us for breakfast at our house.  We would dip them in sweetened condensed milk... YUM!  It was our Thai version of a beignet I suppose...  I miss them!  Thanks for bringing back some great childhood memories by posting this in the 'simple recipes you are almost embarrassed to post'.  I think I will go make a batch now!!!
74281,59636,2007-12-03,5,So bad but OH SO GOOD!!! I used both powdered sugar and granulated sugar and thanks to another review did not use butter-flavored biscuits I used the Grandâ€™s Home-style buttermilk. For the hole in the biscuits I used a shot glass moistened in warm water and made donut holes out of the cut outs.
316717,59636,2008-04-29,5,i got this idea from paula deen on food network and it is awesome. i don't poke holes in it tho. i just throw it in the oil as is. my family just loves it. we like to dip it in cinnamon and sugar. yummy!
88099,59636,2008-06-08,5,So good and so easy to make.  I haven't had doughnuts in years.  What a treat.  Thanks.  Made for ZWT 4.
461834,59636,2008-06-10,5,"This was so quick and easy to make for breakfast.  I sprinkled some with sugar and some with powdered sugar.  Next time I think I might try a chocolate glaze or frosting, as a biscuit dough isn't as sweet as a homemade sweet dough or store bought doughnut.  Made for ZWT Eastern Europe region.  Thanks for sharing."
145352,59636,2008-06-14,5,"Pefect!!! I can't wait to try these out on the grandkids!!! I made half with powdered sugar and half with cinnamon sugar. I preferred the cinnamon, but DH liked the powdered best! So obviously they were both good! Made for ZWT 4."
227607,59636,2008-06-17,5,Made for ZWT4 Bread challenge...These were very quick and good.  I burned the first batch though because they cooked too fast.  I was not expecting them to be done soo quickly.  I bought the smaller biscuits and they worked perfectly.  I will remember this recipe for quick breakfasts.  Has anyone tried freezing these?
353131,59636,2008-06-17,5,"My mom made these often for us when we were kids. What a great,kid friendly,treat and very easy also! Thanks for bringing back a good memory!!"
28649,59636,2008-06-18,5,Very quick and easy to make.  Cheaper than buying doughnuts and my girls loved them.  We put powder sugar on them this time but next time we are going to drizzle melted chocolate on them.  Thanks for posting.  Made for ZWT4 Bread Challenge.
377581,59636,2008-08-17,5,"This is a great quick dish to serve at brunch. It is a super easy treat and so very yummy! I like a variety of toppings. I do cinnamon and sugar, powdered sugar, melt chocolate and dip the donut, or fill with custard or jelly. You can also quarter the biscuits for donut holes. Love these simple donuts."
26512,59636,2008-09-07,5,"We loved making these when we were kids and my grandsons absolutely adore them, they eat them as fast as I can make them. Great kid friendly recipe."
377039,59636,2008-09-13,5,My husband makes these and they're great :)
51011,59636,2009-02-28,5,"I found a great sale & got a ton of biscuits for free.  i remember my Emaw making these for me when I was little, so I decided to give these a try.  Easy & foolproof.  Thanks for sharing :)"
140132,59636,2009-03-10,5,"I have been making these doughnuts for my family for years.  They are so easy and taste really good for a quick simple dessert or snack.  I have done it all with them, chocolate frosting, sugar, powdered sugar, glaze, peanut butter frosting, cream cheese frosting....they all taste great.  I'm so glad you posted this so more people can enjoy them."
620763,59636,2009-09-09,5,These are so good! You need to work really fast and have everything ready before you begin frying because they are done in no time. I made a confectioners sugar glaze and cinnamon sugar topping for ours.
47907,3470,2004-09-29,5,"This is such a quick, easy, and delicious recipe ~ especially for a busy night!  I made the recipe as is except I used approx. 3+ cups of the stuffing mix on top and used 1/4 cup of melted butter and it worked out perfectly.  The chicken was moist and cut with a fork.  Thank you for posting this recipe!"
169969,3470,2004-12-22,5,Very easy and Very Tasty! We thought it was really good...and we are not too fond of recipies with canned soup. I did use the low sodium soup as this tends to cut down on the salty taste that the condensed soup adds to dishes. Thank you for an easy meal!!!
172369,3470,2005-01-29,5,This was so fast easy and delicious. Thank you for a great recipe.  I followed your directions and will be making this again.
189616,3470,2005-05-08,5,"Very good-the chicken was extremely moist, added minced celery, onion and mushrooms to the stuffing mix"
59780,3470,2005-08-20,5,We all loved this recipe! I had a friend over for dinner and she asked for the recipe- a sure sign of a 5 star recipe! This recipe will come in very handy as I head back to classes in September. Thanks for posting :)
74652,3470,2005-10-13,3,I must be in the minority here because we really didn't care for this.  I had to use an entire bag of stuffing mix (2 cups would never have been enough) and it still had way too much liquid and the stuffing was very soggy. It was also very salty.  I really wanted to like this and I'm sorry I couldn't give it a higher rating.  I think I'll stick to an oven version of this recipe I have.
146486,3470,2005-10-25,5,This was very good.  I didn't have any swiss so used shredded cheddar instead.  Turned out very well and had plenty for leftovers too.
203325,3470,2005-11-16,3,Because of all of the high reviews I had high hopes for this recipe.  I have a recipe for this dish that cooks in the oven.  It is not as watery and the stuffing has a better flavor.
232480,3470,2005-12-28,5,SO yummy!  Next time I will double the stuffing as there was plenty of gravy but not enough stuffing for my tastes.  Otherwise - wouldn't change a thing!
359220,3470,2006-11-16,5,"I came home and opened up the lid and saw what looked to be burnt stuffing, so I removed the stuffing off the top and after a small taste realized that it was not burnt, just dark in color..who knows??  But this dish was soooo yummy.  The chicken literally fell apart and I had to use a spoon to scoop the chicken and tasty gravy over some homemade garlic mashed potatoes...perfect after the very long day we had.  Thanks Anne!"
173314,3470,2006-12-10,5,"used 4 whole boneless chicken breasts and sliced into 8 thinner breasts, used 6 slices swiss, 1/2 cup chicken broth and 3 cups stuffing mix...THANK YOU"
286851,3470,2006-12-31,4,"Good, simple recipe. Will likely make again."
37779,3470,2007-09-12,5,"I was in the mood for something homey and comforting. This was a great selection. The chicken was incredibly tender and I loved the flavor of the gravy and stuffing. I used the low-fat versions of the cream soups and thought that worked out well. I put this together in 10 minutes, so there is essentially no prep time. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe."
195589,3470,2007-09-14,5,"This was so tasty! I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, added 1/2 cup of white wine and 2 T of sour cream instead of the milk.
Thanks for a great recipe!"
111291,3470,2007-10-03,5,"Comfort food at its best; and so easy!!  I didn't have the PF herb stuffing, but did have bread cubes.  I wanted to try this recipe without having to run out to the store, so I let them out to get somewhat hard and stale.  Added tarragon, rosemary, sage, poultry seasoning, parsely and onion powder and used this instead. Otherwise, made as posted except used three chicken breasts and just 1 can cream of mushroom.  Because I used the bread cubes, the stuffing was a bit ""mushy"", but the flavor was delicious! Served it with peas and carrots. This tasted like a Thanksgiving meal without any of the hard work! Thanks for a wonderful recipe."
482376,3470,2007-10-04,5,"Delish! It was very easy to put together and the outcome was pure comfort. Nothing fancy, just that good ol' comfort food taste. I used provolone cheese, since I don't care for swiss. It was great. Thanks!"
74281,3470,2007-10-09,4,"My family loved this! I used 2 cans of Cream of Chicken Soup for the mushroom haters in my house and used the entire bag of stuffing plus a cup of seasoned croutons as we are stuffing lovers in my house. After it was cooked I removed the chicken and diced it then stirred the entire thing together like a casserole. I served peas on the side but some mixed them right in with the chicken and stuffing. Everyone, including my twin granddaughters loved this!"
229524,3470,2007-10-20,5,My DH made this and we loved it.  Did use 3 cups stuffing and cut the butter to 1/4th cup as some others have suggested.
140132,3470,2007-12-30,5,Very good.  I served this with mashed potatoes and cranberries.  Delicious meal.  I cooked on low for 6 hours and it was done perfectly.  Thanks for a really good chicken dinner....Stephanie
39301,3470,2008-01-08,5,This was absolutely wonderful!  What a tasty and comforting meal to come home to.  We will be making this often... thanks for posting.
486718,3470,2008-01-14,5,Wonderful!! Made exactly as is and it came out perfect.  Such comfort food and so easy to make - what could be better than that?  Thanks!!!
489552,3470,2008-02-01,5,This was amazing.  The best part was that I used a whole chicken!  I rubbed my chicken with salt/black pepper/garlic powder/paparika.  I then stuffed the chicken with the stuffing mix and used toothpicks to close the cavity of the chicken.  Cooked it in my crock pot for 8 hours.  Fantastic!!  Kids loved it and asked to make it again :) using a whole chicken 0)
184723,3470,2008-06-06,5,"Super great, easy recipe.  My husband LOVED this.  I used a pkg of low sodium stove top stuffing (came out to be three cups) and it was great.  The only thing I would do differently is spray my crockpot with non stick spray first because it wasn't fun to scrub off!!! :) Oh... and i only used 1/4 cup of margarine on top. Thanks!"
497077,3470,2008-08-21,5,"Comfort food that is so easy and DELICIOUS! I have made this many times now and all have been great but my fav changes are to sprinkle poultry seasoning and pepper on the chicken, omit the cheese, and use cornbread instead of the bread stuffing mix. To my crumbled cornbread, I add chopped onion, celery, bell pepper, mushrooms, parsley, sage-just like you would make your stuffing but I bet Stove Top Cornbread mix would be great, too. I also like to add veggies like baby carrots, peas, green beans, kernel corn for all-in-one meal. This is also great w/ pork chops and you can add some sour cream to change it up a bit. In my crock pot I love to use the liners and my chicken is fully cooked in 3 hours on low. And of course, serve w/ cranberry sauce! Thank you, Anne, for a great recipe!!!"
579298,3470,2008-10-05,5,This was soooooo goooood!!!! Not for the health concious though :) Very yummy comfort food. Mmmmm Mmmmm good!
158086,3470,2008-11-04,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe...I have not been feeling so good, and have had not much of an appetite, this was a good thing to make and tasted wonderful...I too did not have any swiss cheese so subbed with morzerella and provolone blend."
847160,3470,2009-04-05,4,that was good but nest time i will do it in the oven son the stuffing can get crisp .. thanks
371738,3470,2008-11-14,4,"Good for throwing something together quickly.  I would suggest one of two things:  either omit the salt on the chicken breasts or purchase low-sodium/healthy request soups and broth.  I like salty, but this was too much for me.  Very easy recipe.  Thanks."
189475,3470,2009-02-07,5,"I have made this several times and forgot to review it. It's a great recipe. Delicious, and so easy! The first time I did add the swiss cheese, but for some reason I couldn't even tell that the cheese was in there when it was done cooking. So the other times I made it, I just left out the cheese."
49304,3470,2009-03-22,5,"I have made this several times, keep forgrtting to review it. It is so delocious and easy to prepare. DH loves it. Thank you Anne for posting the recipe."
808027,3470,2009-03-24,5,Great combination...great taste.  Left out the cheese and didn't miss it at all.  I used low sodium broth and one of the cans of soup was reduced sodium but it was still a bit salty...that's a personal preference and I can adjust next time.  Will definitely make again.  The chicken was so tender!  Will definitely make this one again.  Thanks for posting!
218535,3470,2010-01-12,5,The stuffing was so good that I'd recommend using the whole box instead of 2 cups.
768828,3470,2010-01-20,0,"I'm not going to give this any stars because so many people loved it and I don't want to bring the rating down.  I really liked the flavor of the chicken, but the stuffing was mushy.  I will probably make again, but won't put any stuffing in - maybe add a few potatoes."
173579,3470,2011-03-11,5,We thought this was a very good Chicken and Dressing.  Only thing I would suggest is one might use the lower sodium soups.  It tends to be a little salty tasting.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
191533,3470,2011-07-29,2,"I just can't give this one a great rating. It did taste very good, but that was thanks to Kraft's StoveTop stuffing, not the recipe. I used 2 very large chicken breasts, a box of Stove Top mix, omitted the cheese and used half the butter. Otherwise followed the recipe. It cooked in half the time listed in my 6 qt. crockpot. The stuffing was a goopy wet mess. Flavor was great, but like I said..."
131021,3470,2013-07-05,5,This was really good stuff. I used 2 boxes of Stove Top stuffing mix and left out the cheese. We really enjoyed it and I&#039;m sad there are no more leftovers.
456858,3470,2013-12-02,5,This was REALLY good &amp; so easy 2 prepare.
1052873,3470,2014-04-05,5,"Made with rabbit - 2 cut up fryers. Tenderest, most flavorful meat I&#039;ve made. Those that ate stuffing complained it was too greasy. Maybe less butter next time. Forgot to use cheese..."
198154,3470,2016-05-25,5,"After reading the reviews, I added an extra cup of stuffing, next time I may add a little more. My family really liked this. It was easy to throw together in the morning and have it ready and waiting when we got home. The Chicken was fall apart tender and the gravy was good. It didn't have the soup taste I was expecting. In fact, my family like it so much that next time I may make mashed potatoes or rice to serve it over."
386849,141789,2008-05-06,5,"This recipe is SO easy and fast.  Plus, the taste is GREAT!  Highly recommended."
27643,37413,2002-08-28,5,"This is a real husband pleaser!! The patties are moist and the gravy is scrumpious!! Couldn't be easier. This was enjoyed by all. We served it with mashed potatoes and frozen peas. Great recipe! I will make this again...and again...and, Thanks papergoddess!"
35526,37413,2002-09-20,5,"I added sliced onions after frying the meat.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and corn.  Very simple, good meal that everyone enjoyed."
51011,37413,2003-01-08,5,"This recipe is sooooo good!! I followed the recipe almost exactly ( i added 1 chopped clove of garlic, and 1/4 cup of chopped onion.  This was so flavorful, and there are plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Also, I actually made gravy that tasted good (which is a first!!!) Thanks so much for posting this!"
9869,37413,2003-02-01,5,"I used about 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef and got 6 patties. The gravy was tasty and very 'creamy'. A real winner in this house, thanks for posting!"
39835,37413,2003-10-31,5,"Very good way to have burgers!  We served this with Southern Buttermilk Biscuits recipe#26110 and corn for a great ""comfort"" meal. Thanks for sharing this keeper middle-of-the-week quick supper recipe."
101823,37413,2003-11-05,5,"My husband prepared this tonight!  It was a definate treat to have a home-style meal and not to have to cook it!  He subbed beef broth for the water in the gravy, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was hearty and definately flavored well.  He served it with egg noodles and a salad.  We will be adding this to our easy home cooking file!"
68460,37413,2004-08-24,5,"This is a delicious after-work meal, my family loved it!  Made as the recipe directed and it came out perfect.  I served this with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  Thanks papergoddess for an excellent, quick meal!"
7108,37413,2004-10-14,5,"A quick, easy, hearty and filling comfort food dinner.  I served this with mashed potatoes and I also doubled the gravy.  This recipe was ""lost"", saved over 2 years ago and I really wish I had found it sooner because the family really enjoyed, thank you!"
64203,37413,2004-10-18,5,"Wow! This recipe has excellent reviews because it is a truly delicious dish! Very easy to use with ingredients you probably have on hand. I served them over Buttered Egg Noodles (Best Ever) #11107 and it was a perfect combination!
Thanks for posting such a delicious recipe!"
42720,37413,2004-10-29,5,"This recipe is versatile, easy to prepare and a real family pleaser!  I was all set to makes this when I discovered I didn't have onion soup mix but I did have beefy mushroom dry soup mix so I substituted that for the onion.  The meat patties were moist and delicious and the gravy was fantastic with the mushrooms. I served this with fluffy white rice and my dh and ds both had seconds.   I can't wait to make this again and this time I will use onion soup mix to see which one we like the best.  Thanks for a great recipe.  "
169969,37413,2005-04-08,5,"This was so easy to make and DH gobbled it up. We are a bit salt sensitive so we did not use all the Onion Soup mix. I really liked the way the meat tasted....
Great meal to make in a pinch! Thank you for posting!"
47559,37413,2005-06-04,5,"I doubled the recipe for three of us.  DH had three beef patties, and DS two!  I served it over noodles.  Both of them loved it, and had leftovers the next day.  I used half the recommended amount of onion soup mix (just one packet total for the doubled recipe), so I had to add some salt, but it was still very flavorful.  A wonderful, weeknight friendly, man-pleasing recipe."
37036,37413,2005-09-19,5,This recipe has so many reviews that I just had to give it a try!  I followed the directions but used only 1/4 cup fine bread crumbs.  That was the only change I made.  I did use PaulaG's recipe for Onion Soup Mix instead of using the pre-packaged soup mix.  The meat turned out very tender and the flavor was perfect!  Thanks papergoddess for a new family favorite!
13483,37413,2005-10-24,5,"This is as close to the definition of comfort food you can get.  It was terrific!!  My left over patties will become a hamburger with the gravey topping my ""Chips""!!  Looking forward to that too.  Thanks papergoddess"
60992,37413,2005-12-07,5,"Very good! DH just loved this! It was very easy to put together, a great weeknight meal. I served this with Cheddar garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. It was a most enjoyable meal."
32058,37413,2006-01-05,5,I thought this was terrific and compforting!  My picky DH and DS thought otherwise. they thought it needed ketchup?!? Served with homemade noodles and green beans!  Would make again.
44383,37413,2006-05-01,5,I've made these at least twice now and both DH and I love this meal. I serve it with hot noodles or rice and a veggie. It's fast and easy and great weeknight comfort meal. It's going into my keeper file so thanks for posting it.
203325,37413,2006-06-13,4,This was very much like salisbury steak.  It was simple to make and fairly low in calories.  I served the hamburger patties with gravy over wide egg noodles.
174991,37413,2006-09-20,5,"Wonderful meal, quick and simple.  The only thing that I did different was to use salt free steak sauce for the worcestershire sauce and I made my own salt free dry onion soup mix. It's a keeper."
280271,37413,2006-10-01,5,"Papergoddess, I really don't think you need another 5 stars. But you are getting it anyway! I was running late for work so took out a pound of ground beef. Ran to zaar to figure out what to fix when I got home. Gave DH two choice's. He said ""Beef patties with gravy sounds like comfort food, can I have that?"" I think he  made an excellent choice. He was like a contented cat and purred the rest of the night. Thanks, for posting."
269331,37413,2006-10-30,5,"The meat patties were dense, may be because I used ground turkey, but very moist and tasty.  The gravy was yummmm!"
140132,37413,2007-04-15,5,Comfort food at its best.  This was very good.  I love comfort foods and DH could eat every meal like this....lol.  I will be making this again as it is not only tasty but simple too.  I served this with mashed potatoes and corn.  Thank you so much....Stephanie
227607,37413,2007-06-13,4,We liked this...I think next time I would spice it up with more seasonings.
46660,37413,2007-07-25,5,"Delicious and easy to make!  I did add some red wine along with the water and soup, and I mixed some minced garlic into the ground beef mixture.  I really liked the gravy, and so did my boys!  I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand.  Thanks!"
229524,37413,2007-08-18,5,I can see why this has so many fantastic reviews.  My DH said this was Grandma Good!!!!!  It had the kind of flavor that reminds him of his Grandma's cooking.  I used Copycat Lipton's Onion Soup Mix (24952).  This recipe will definitely go to the head of our  all time favorite recipes.
248023,37413,2007-09-28,4,"Sooooo easy and delicious!!!  It was a cool and rainy evening, so I was craving something in the ""comfort food"" catagory.  This turned out great... I used Recipe #24952 for the soup mix but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did add some sliced fresh mushrooms and topped off each patty with a thick slice of vidalia onion as they simmered.  They made the whole house smell delicious... my BF kept wandering into the kitchen to ask if it was time to eat yet!  Very economical and filling... I served it with Recipe #181233 and Recipe #27361 for the ultimate comfort food meal!  Thanks for posting!"
369715,37413,2007-12-15,5,These were really good and easy to make. My whole family loved the taste of these. I doubled the recipe but only added 2 cups of water in the gravy. I didn't need to the flour because the gravy thicken up nicely. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Will be making this more often.
218535,37413,2007-12-18,5,Delicious. I'd double the gravy next time.
189616,37413,2008-02-01,5,Good comfort food. I added some kitchen bouquet for a darker gravy. Served this with recipe#11107 and recipe#84665
242484,37413,2008-06-04,5,These are so tender & delish...I will certainly be making again & would suggest doubling gravy if you plan to use it for mashed potatoes or noodles.
286851,37413,2008-07-01,4,"My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was simple to put together for a quick dinner. My young, picky children gobbled it up, which is saying a lot! I followed the directions as stated but used beefy onion soup mix, which is what I had on hand, and it turned out great. The patties were moist and the gravy mild. I served this with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. Thanks for sharing!"
371738,37413,2008-08-07,5,"I was torn between a 4 and 5; went with the 5 stars based on the speediness and simplicity of this recipe.  I used Lipton's Beefy onion soup mix, as it was all I had.  Still tasted very good. No left overs."
298447,37413,2008-08-27,5,"""Yummy, yummy to my tummy"" is an understatement!  This is delish!  What a great go-to recipe for those crazy, hectic week night dinners.  Start to finish in under an hour and tastes soooo good--it's not hard to see why it's become a family favorite, too.  Another bonus is that this recipe uses many ingredients that I seem to always have on hand, so no special trips to the store to pick up anything (in a pinch).  For the onion soup mix, I always use foodtvfan's recipe:  http://www.recipezaar.com/110331  .  Thanks, papergoddess."
969481,37413,2008-11-02,5,"Excellent recipe! The only change I made was using italian bread crumbs because this was all I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it is very delicious. I made these with the Butter Egg Noondles recipe #11107 and a veggie for a full meal for our family of 4. Certainly a kid pleaser as well. This will be incorporated into our recipe collection. Thanks for sharing!"
358796,37413,2008-12-15,4,"Reminds me of childhood. I liked that this was not overly salty, but still had flavor. Makes an excellent gravy for taters. Thanks for posting!"
400420,37413,2009-04-14,4,"DH loves this sort of dish, so I gave it a try and it was very good.  I usually chop some onions and just mix it up with the beef.  I did add chopped onions to the beef, subbed wheat germ for the breadcrumbs and forgot the Worcestershire.  I think next time, I'll skip the breadcrumbs and eggs, as I thought they seemed a bit dry, but I'm keeping the onion soup mix part, as it adds a great flavor.  Thanks for a good variation on a classic comfort food!"
55729,37413,2009-05-09,4,Good and easy. I served this with Recipe #17763 and instant garlic mashed potatoes.
389431,37413,2009-07-28,3,"This is what TV dinners aspire to be!  Good... but not fabulous... I'm thinking it might have been the few changes I made, but maybe not... I used beef broth instead of water and added a can of mushrooms...  doubled the gravy since we really like our gravy around here.
The last step with the gravy took a lot more water than called for to make it a gravy consistency...
Served it with mashed potatoes...
I might make this again but it isn't going in our keeper box..."
168462,37413,2009-10-20,5,I made these into meatballs and baked them in the oven for 30 minutes. Once the gravy was made I let them simmer for a few minutes. These are easy and my family loved them. Thanks for the recipe
91392,37413,2009-11-12,3,"OK, not a speacial one for us.  Fast and easy to do though and makes nice gravt easily."
55578,37413,2010-01-26,4,"A nice easy recipe.  I think the patties need a little umph, but a great little recipe for busy nights"
103876,37413,2010-04-01,4,"I made this into meatballs and served over egg noodles.  It was nice for something different.  The gravy didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped, but it was still good."
50969,37413,2010-04-02,5,"UPDATE on 4/1/10: I've made this recipe several times since I first tried this in December of 2005. This time instead of serving it with the normal sides of mashed potatoes and veggies, I decided to make an open faced sandwich out of the beef patties and gravy. And I have to tell you it's still the ultimate in comfort food.This was my original post on December 7th, 2005 "" i wish i could give it more than 5*'s. my SO even agreed with me that this is a five. this is the ultimate in comfort food.and you were so right on the cook time.the gravy thickened up so nice.this will be made again and again in my home.thank you so much for posting. "" "" Keep Smiling :) """
195589,37413,2010-06-17,5,"I made these some time ago and can't believe I forgot to review them! They were very tasty! I had to make up some fresh breadcrumbs, then dry them. Like others, I also added some sliced onions while browning the patties. Everybody loved them. Thanks for posting, papergoddess."
847160,37413,2010-08-18,4,good for a really fast recipe
789516,37413,2011-06-25,4,"I was worried that these would taste like hamburgers but they were actually very good, and the gravy was great!   Very easy to put together."
135887,37413,2013-01-27,4,I added onions as other reviewers suggested.  Also for the 1/2 cup of water and flour I used red wine.  I think using beef broth would make it too salty because it's borderline salty as it is.  Overall pretty yummy and easy.
173579,37413,2013-03-30,5,This is a very good recipe and so easy to fix.  It is great served with mashed potatoes. Thanks for posting.
37779,37413,2013-12-09,5,"We have all been sick with the &quot;crud&quot; and in need of good comfort food. This was the answer. Super easy to put together, and sooo delicious. Served with mashed potatoes with that incredible gravy. Thanks for sharing what is sure to become a regular at our house."
894666,37413,2015-10-15,5,"This was a really good recipe. I didn&#039;t measure the amount of ground beef I used and I think it was more than the recipe called for, still turned out great. I got 10 smallish patties out of it. Cooked in two batches. Served on buttermilk biscuits with carrot soup on the side...mmm. Will make again for sure."
53932,141789,2005-11-08,5,I also used boneless pork chops and very much enjoyed the dish.  These are so easy to prepare and so tasty.  Thank you for sharing.
174991,141789,2005-12-30,5,These chops were sooooo tender and they just melted in your mouth.  I didn't have ceasar dressing so I used ranch dressing.  This is definately a company dish.
55729,141789,2006-02-06,4,"I really enjoyed these chops, and they were super easy to put together. I used recipe #124368 for the Caesar dressing."
49304,141789,2006-02-12,5,"These are OMG the very best pork chops. My DH said, he wants his pork chops cooked like this from now on also they deserve more than 5 stars. They are so moist, tender and super easy to make. I made them just like the recipe stated. Thank you for posting the recipe, I will be making them again & again!"
142464,141789,2006-02-18,5,"I was a bit skeptical when I read Ceasar Salad Dressing with pork, but gave it a try anyway.  Boy, was I ever glad I did.  The recipe was easy and the pork chops were absolutely delicious, moist and very flavorful.  MarieAlice, this one is a keeper for sure! Thanks"
15521,141789,2006-02-18,3,"This was OK, but wasn't a favorite of ours.  Baking it made it too greasy.  Next time I'd try frying them and draining.  Maybe someone else's suggestion to use Italian Bread crumbs would be good too."
52543,141789,2006-03-02,5,"Definitely a winner! I trimmed the fat from a couple of 1"" thick, boneless chops & followed the directions. They were moist, tender and certainly not greasy. Thanx for a repeater MarieAlice!"
169969,141789,2006-03-10,5,This is a five for easy easy and great taste! Everyone loved these chops and ours were not greasy. Perfect for a quick week-day meal! Thanks for sharing!
232480,141789,2006-03-22,4,"I loved these but dh did not.  He wouldn't even finish his  He said they were dry, which I completely disagree with - and I'm usually the complainer about that!  But he isn't feeling well, so that could easily be why."
60992,141789,2006-05-17,5,"Great pork chop recipe! I used boneless loin chops which I pounded thinner. I did have one problem which I quickly solved...When I dipped the first pork chop in the ceasar dressing, nearly all of it stuck to it!!!! I brushed it off, and from then on used a pastry brush to generously brush the dressing on both sides. Mine did not brown the way I would have liked them to, but the flavor was out of this world!!!"
222564,141789,2006-09-23,5,"Very very yummy, and so so easy. Thank you for a keeper recipe!"
136997,141789,2006-10-08,4,These were delicious! :)
149363,141789,2006-12-14,5,"These chops were just delicious and a real kid pleaser, my 6 year old loved them too!
Very simple to make, and turned out a moist delicious pork chop dish.
Thanks so much for posting!"
158086,141789,2006-12-20,5,This turned out to be a 10 star recipe...wonderful flavor and it smelled so great in my kitchen...I am planning on making this over an over again...
207176,141789,2007-01-15,5,So easy to make and so tasty!  All of us (except my youngest son-who is picky) liked it a lot.  I served it with a rice pilaf and roasted asparagus.  My older son thought this would work well on chicken too.  Thanks for posting.
178742,141789,2007-03-22,5,"Just tried these today and they turned out fabulous! I was really hesitant, but now that I know how really really good they are, I think I could change the recipe up and use any of my favorite creamy dressings! I added additional seasonings in my flour. We will for sure have these again. Thank you for sharing!"
140132,141789,2007-04-19,4,"I had some caesar dressing to use up and found this recipe.  It was perfect and tasted so delicious.  I loved the tang it gave to the chops.  I will add this to my usuals as it was very good and simple.....thanks, Stephanie"
199792,141789,2007-05-22,5,We really enjoyed these very different pork chops. The flavour was nice and the cheese was yummy. I don't think I would change anything.
187281,141789,2007-07-15,5,"I followed the recipe except I used grated parmesan cheese instead of shredded. The pork chops were very good. To give a little more color, I broiled on low for a few minutes. We'll definitely make this again!  I wanted to update my review to say that using Ken's Steakhouse Northern Italian Dressing with basil and romano works very well with this dish.  If you use a quality dressing with detectable flavor this dish really works well."
173314,141789,2007-12-17,5,loved these...used thick boneless.. baked about 35 minutes...had used italian blend shredded cheese...thanks and will make again....
278113,141789,2007-12-30,4,"These were great, thanks for sharing!"
184723,141789,2008-01-01,5,Delish!!! Made my own creamy caesar & they turned out perfect!  Done n 35 mins!  Thanks.
68460,141789,2008-01-20,5,"I halved this recipe for just my husband and myself and we both loved it. I made this exactly as written....good recipe to use up small amounts (in my case, salad dressing and cheese) of ingredients you have on hand. Thanks for posting this MarieAlice, it's a keeper :)

**01/20/08 Update on my original review...I made these chops using buttermilk ranch dressing (I was out of Caesar dressing) and that added a whole new dimension of flavor."
632249,141789,2008-01-20,4,Good flavour but not so appealing to the eye. Mine looked kind of pale in colour and not nicely browned like some of the photos. Next time I would add the cheese in the last 10-15 min and maybe broil to get that nice brown colour. Thx.
47907,141789,2008-01-25,4,We enjoyed these pork chops but they did not have as much flavor as I would have liked.  Mine also came out pale looking so I stuck them under the broiler for a minute or two to brown them up.  I think I might marinate the chops in the dressing next time for more flavor.  Thanks for posting!!
176615,141789,2008-02-04,5,"Quick and easy to fix, makes a great weeknight meal. Used boneless pork chops and Marzetti's Supreme Caesar dressing. Very tender and yes, mine looked just like the picture. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
485151,141789,2008-12-03,5,"I loved this- and I even messed up following the simple directions! It was so quick to make with just a few ingrediants. I doubled the recipe and used 8 boneless pork loin chops and used ranch dressing instead of caesar. I was worried that it might be a little bland, so I added some dry Italian dressing mix (maby 1-2 tsp?) and 1 1/2-2 tsp Italian seasoning to the flour. I got mixed up on the directions, I first generously coated both sides of the pork chops in ranch and THEN coated them in the flour mixture. I baked them for about 35 minutes and when I took them out I realized I forgot to put the cheese on top. I was out of parmesan, so I sprinkled a shredded mozzarella pizza blend on top and put it back in the oven for about 2-3 minutes so it could melt. I served it with green beans & stuffing and we all cleaned our plates. My youngest even had seconds! This is definitely going in our menu rotation!"
499050,141789,2008-12-30,5,Yum.
262312,141789,2009-01-29,4,"nice and easy recipe.  the caesar gives off a nice tangy flavor.  i used thin, boneless chops.  i also jazzed up the flour a bit more with garlic powder, cayenne and salt and pepper.  i didn't measure the dressing, perhaps i used too much or the brand that i used was too greasy.  i ended up pulling the chops out of the casserole dish cuz they were sitting in grease.  I placed them on a baking sheet, topped with parm and then broiled.  they browned up but were still very soft.  i might experiment with browning the chops first, then coating in dressing and parm and just broiling quickly.  anyway, thanks for sharing.  served with roasted asparagus and twice baked potatoes."
789516,141789,2010-05-12,5,"Fantastic and easy!  I browned my boneless butterfly chops in a bit of oil olive before adding the caesar dressing and throwing in the oven.  By doing so this reduced the cooking time in the oven by half.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again, thanks for posting!"
203325,141789,2009-08-29,5,Another keeper.  This was quick and easy.
147109,141789,2009-09-11,4,"I thought these were very good, the only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 is that my hubby was not too excited about them, and he is pretty picky about pork so I was looking for a recipe that he would enjoy."
44383,141789,2010-02-06,5,"Really Good! Used Newman's Own for dressing and it was so easy and tasty.  Served with a simple Cesar salad to stay with them. Adding to regular rotation, both DH and I thoroughly enjoyed these."
173579,141789,2011-07-20,5,We really did enjoy these pork chops.  They had so much flavor.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
928301,141789,2012-08-30,3,They were ok.
33159,141789,2013-05-05,3,Unfortunately this rating is 100% from my hubby - I had to run out to attend to a family emergency while they were still in the oven &amp; then I took my chop in my lunch the next day &amp; proceeded to melt the Tupperware that I was reheating it in.  He said he enjoyed the flavour but didn&#039;t like the texture of the flour coating on the meat.
149363,96886,2005-05-11,5,"This was awesome! Our whole family loved this dish. The only thing I did differently was to use fresh spinach, and top it all with cheddar as I ran out of parmesan, although I am sure the parmesan would have been even better. This will be a regular in our home. Thanks for another keeper Kitten!"
160974,96886,2005-09-11,5,"I'm a spinach lover but the rest of the family aren't (but I'm trying to train them!) so I used one bag of fresh spinach (freshly steamed). My family accepts spinach more readily when it has noticeable garlic, which really adds the flavor in this dish. I used cheddar and parmesan and maybe will try with mozzarella/provolone mixture next time. This was really delicious and it is always brings me satisfaction when my family will eat a spinach dish without balking. I appreciated the tip warning against overbaking. Mine was just right and it really makes it a comort food. Served this with Oven Crusty Fish  Recipe #114401. Thanks Kittencal!
Roxygirl"
37036,96886,2005-09-26,5,This rice dish was so creamy and the taste and texture were perfect.  It kind of reminded me of broccoli cheese casserole.  I cut the recipe in half and used 2 eggs and whole milk.  Thanks Kittencal for another wonderful recipe!
52543,96886,2005-12-03,5,"Hubby, who is the spinach lover in our house, gave the rating for this dish but ........ at this rate, you just might convert me! I scaled the recipe in half, steamed some fresh baby spinach ........ then I followed the directions. Thanx Carol!"
55729,96886,2006-06-03,5,This is soooooo good! I will definitely make this again. One good way to get the family to eat spinach. The leftovers were even devoured for breakfast.
222055,96886,2006-07-26,5,We had this as a side dish to chicken and it was lovely. Dh and I both agreed- 5 stars! Thank you for yet another wonderful recipe Kitten!
98919,96886,2006-07-29,5,I love Spinach Pie and this recipe rates right there on top.  Truthfully I only had 1 egg and 2% milk and it still was great.  I can imagine what it tastes like making it the right way.  This will be one that I make often.  Thanks Kitten!
312577,96886,2007-03-19,5,"I doubled this recipe and am really glad I did.  I used mostly mozzeralla and parm. cheese.  When I first took a bite I was honestly surprised what depth of flavor this dish has.  This is no ordinary rice dish.  Kittencal, you are truly talented.  This is very, very good and I am glad I finally got around to making this recipe. (Plus this is an easy, relatively inexpensive recipe to make!)"
227607,96886,2006-10-03,5,YUMMY!!!  I made this with Jumbo Shrimp Parmesan also from Zaar.  It was a great combination.  I finally found a way to get my kids to eat spinach. They loved it.  It is also very easy.  For the parmesan I used a parmesan and romano cheese mix and used colby jack cheese in the mix.
136997,96886,2006-11-02,5,"Another Kittencal hit! Loved the texture. I think I will saute the onions a bit next time. I found them to be a bit overpowering even though there only was a 1/4 cup. Used fresh spinach and I didn't top with anymore cheese and I baked it covered, becasue I didn't want a crust to form. Personal preferance. My husband mummbled something about it being good a couple of times. :) "
226863,96886,2007-01-01,5,"Wonderful!!!  I could make an entire meal off of this dish!  I cooked it covered half the time, and uncovered it the rest of the time.  I used a package of fresh spinach, and still drained and squeezed out the water.  I was a little skeptical at first, grease was boilint out of the dish...but it was very tasty!  I won't be able to make it for a while, since I am going on a low fat diet, but this casserole is fabulous.  If you can afford the fat and calories, I encourage you to use them on this dish!  Wonderful!!"
142335,96886,2007-02-28,5,This tastes so good and I love all the ingredients. The only reason I won't make this exact recipe to often is because it fattening:( But again it's soooo good. Thanks!
347822,96886,2007-03-01,4,"Very good!!! I used leftover white Basmati Rice, 2 (240 g)packages of frozen spinach, and shredded mozzarella instead of cheddar and/or swiss cheese. I was debating on whether to add an extra egg, but glad I didn't, texture was perfect.  Cooked covered for 20 mins, added extra mozzarella and baked uncovered for an additional 10 minutes. Thank you loads for the posting, Kittencal!!!"
146486,96886,2007-09-17,5,Yummy!  This is outstanding!  I omitted the butter and used skim milk and reduced fat cheese.  I used cheddar and parmesan and then topped it with mozzarella.  I only used 3 eggs and thought it was fine.  We will be having this again and again!! Fantastic dish Kittencal!!!
173579,96886,2008-01-30,5,This was just fabulous!  I put the swiss cheese in it.  It was so cheesy and good.  I will will be making it many more times.  Thanks for posting.
140132,96886,2008-02-21,5,"What a wonderful way to get kids to eat spinach.  I made this one night when DD had a friend over.  Both girls ate and ate it.  When they asked what it was hubby told them it was spinach and DD's friend said ""NO way I hate spinach""  Well she went home and asked her mom to make spinach.  I received a phone call and she asked me how I got her daughter to spinach.  I told her about recipezaar and gave her the # to this recipe.  Anyway, thank you so much for this really good recipe that was enjoyed by all in our home.....Stephanie"
269331,96886,2008-12-29,5,I made this for a Christmas Eve Potluck and everyone devoured it!  I doubled the rice and left most the rest of the ingredient as is (I did not use the mozzarella cheese on top).  Very Yumm!
426903,96886,2008-04-27,5,This dish was a great way to blend in veggies for people (like my dh) who doesn't like veggies. Thanks for posting.
93006,96886,2008-06-27,5,"Not sure what happened on my previous review because this stuff is to die for.  I actually just threw in all my leftover rice (about 3 cups) and it was perfect - cheesy, succulent, delicious.  Yum!"
125640,96886,2008-07-23,5,"Easy, rich, and very tasty. DH loved it. He said to make sure I put this in the keep file, and that's the first time he's said that about anything for a long time. Thanks so much for sharing."
174991,96886,2009-06-03,5,I made this with brown rice and lentils.  I also used  no salt seasoning for the seasoning salt and omitted the additional cheese on top.  This is a wonderful and tasty dish. I'll  be using this ofter.
368078,96886,2009-08-29,5,"10+ stars for this one!!  Now that my DH has had this, I have a feeling that we will be making it often (he can't stop talking about it).  We halved the recipe, using 1 jumbo egg, the Italian blend of cheeses (instead of cheddar or swiss) and green onions, and baking in an 8x8 dish.  I don't think it could have turned out any better.  Thanks Kittencal...we can always count on your recipes to turn out great!"
147109,96886,2009-09-11,5,"This was wonderful, my hubby gave it rave reviews. I used brown rice and used 2 % milk and did not add any extra cheese. It was great! Thanks!"
333017,96886,2010-07-24,5,"Excellent recipe!  I divided the dish into to smaller casserole dishes....enough for 4 people.  It was enjoyed by all!!!  My only comments would be to spray your casserole dishes with spray as the egg mixture does get stuck to the dish.  Kudos, Kitten on another winner!!"
64642,96886,2013-12-01,5,A big hit with the javascript:postComment();family.  We had a some leftover and froze it for future use.  I&#039;ll be making this ahead in the future to freeze into serving portions (the recipe makes a huge batch and there&#039;s only the two of us!).  Highly recommend.
768828,96886,2014-04-23,5,"This was really good.  DH doesn&#039;t care for rice much, but he didn&#039;t even complain about it being in this.  He likes spinach and said this was pretty good.  That&#039;s  worth 5 stars."
7108,11107,2002-08-02,4,"Very good.  Next time I will cut down on the butter, and add more water.  I used HerbOx boullion cubes."
8688,11107,2002-10-03,5,"These noodles were so easy to prepare and the taste was excellent! The only change I would make is to add 1/2 cup more water to boil the noodles in. I ran out of water before the noodles were tender.  Great recipe, David!  Thank you!"
37036,11107,2003-05-21,4,"These were really good.  I used 1/2 cup unsalted butter and it was still a bit greasy.  I'm thinking of decreasing the butter by 1 T next time, to see if that will make a difference.  I used 1 1/2 cups water and 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon granuals.  The liquid doesn't cover the noodles, so it's important to stir constantly until the noodles are done.  An addition of parsley just before serving might be nice to add a little color. "
42720,11107,2003-10-27,5,"Wow!  Add me to the list of people who find it hard to believe that something this simple could be so delicious!!  This recipe is outstanding! I followed the instructions exactly and did not add any extra butter.  Creamy and delicious egg noodles!  Thanks for sharing.
"
101034,11107,2004-09-16,5,Great tasting noodles and so simple to make...we loved them. I added alittle fresh parsley. Thanks David
59780,11107,2004-09-23,5,"Great recipe! I did use OXO chciken boullion powder packets instead of Wyler's cubes, but it turned out great anyway. I served this with my easy chicken parmesan recipe#58229 and it was delicious and easy! Thanks for posting!"
64203,11107,2004-10-18,5,These noodles were so delicious and extra easy to make! I served them with Beef Patties in Onion Gravy #37413 and it was a perfect combination. I will use this recipe over and over again. Thanks so much for posting it!
9869,11107,2004-11-07,5,"I used the lesser amount of butter and added a little more water. These were great.
And will definitely make them again.
"
47907,11107,2004-12-31,5,Excellent noodles!  I made them exactly as posted and I was a little nervous since there are more noodles than water.  I stirred alot (like the other reviewer) and I also covered the pan which helped.  All was well in the end ~ the noodles were wonderful!  Thank you for posting the recipe.
229850,11107,2006-04-17,5,"What can I say, easy and delicious. I have been making buttered noodles for years, tipically just boiling noodles and then adding salt and butter. This is sooo simple but what a difference. I did use egg dumplings, just a personal preference. This was just inhaled at my house. Thanx for great recipe."
58836,11107,2006-06-25,4,"These noodles were pretty good. Fixed them for my grandkids and they scarfed them down.  The only thing is when you drain, you seem to drain all the yummy out.  I'm sure I will make again."
52125,11107,2006-06-30,5,These noodles were very good and enjoyed by all. Thanks David Ball....
68460,11107,2006-08-27,5,"These worked so well for us! Not only do they taste wonderful but I have a tiny kitchen and not having to drain the noodles was a huge help for me.  I didn't use Wyler's chicken cubes, I used a teaspoon of Watkin's in some homemade broth and I didn't add as much butter as the recipe called for, only about half.  I'll definitely be making noodles this way again....it's so easy and delicious!  Thanks David!
****update on 8/27/06**** since my husband's heart 'incident', I've had to change our cooking habits.  I made this favorite recipe of ours a bit differently and it worked!  I used sodium-free, Herb Ox chicken boullion, Earth Balance 'Buttery Sticks' (which are no cholesterol, non-dairy) and for the noodles, I used 'No Yolks' egg noodles.  This was still terrific and I'm so glad we can still enjoy this recipe!  Thanks again David Ball :)"
101823,11107,2006-09-06,4,"A very simple and flavorful side dish that would complement many meals.  I even downsized the recipe to serve just my hubby without any problems.  Herbs would perk this up, but are not at all necessary.  I served this with my Leeks Braised in Cream With Garlic and Lemon and Almond -Crusted Chicken Breasts.  The noodles completed a great meal.
EDITTED TO ADD that these were a great accompaniment to <a href=""/45975"">Crock Pot Apple and Sauerkraut Kielbasa (Low Fat)</a>."
207176,11107,2006-11-11,4,First let me say that my DH loved them. Kids weren't in a noodles mood and I liked them.  I had a problem though because I used 12 oz. of noodles so I added a little extra water to make 2 cups but I had to stir to get all the noodles covered with water.  I think I even needed more water (I covered it to let the steam help cook them too).  I used Herb Ox bouillon since there is no MSG in them.  Thanks for posting and next time I'll use a smaller bag of noodles or a wider pan!
169969,11107,2006-12-13,5,"David, these were great!!! Served them along side a London broil and they were a hit. Every last bit was eaten! Thank you for such an easy, quick and tasty side dish recipe!(01-12-05) UPDATE: I still make these noodles and we still love them. I do add fresh parsley with the last of the butter a couple minutes before serving. Thanks David!"
232480,11107,2006-12-17,3,"For the calorie content I was expecting something a little more exciting.  My grandmother used to make a similar dish but I don't have her recipe - but it was much, much creamier.  I was expecting something along those lines.  As another reviewer mentioned, it's important to note the water/bouillon won't completely cover the noodles and you need to stir frequently to ensure all the noodles are cooked.  I wonder if I used milk for all or part of the liquid if they would turn out even creamier?"
251917,11107,2007-01-29,5,These noodles live up to their name! These were delicious!! I served mine with a stew - excellent!! My husband and I helped ourselves to a bowl each of them plain first though - LOL!!
251626,11107,2007-03-19,4,Really nice. Added 1/2 cup more water and cut the butter to 1/4 cup as suggested by others.
132383,11107,2007-03-20,5,Hi there...my husband and I got home late on Sunday and when we looked in the cabinet all we had was egg noodles...so we made this!  We both loved them and will be making them again.  We accidentally made this with beef bouillon but we loved it.  We also took another reviewers suggestion and added a bit of cream cheese.  Wonderful!
447123,11107,2007-04-06,5,Just made this. WOW is it lovely. IT had a nice flavor and the family loved it. I added some roasted garlic that I had made and boy with that addition it really set it over the top. Thanks for a great staple to my dinners Davis!!!
135887,11107,2007-04-07,5,Buttery yumminess!  My DD (queen of carbs) loved it.  Will make again.
278113,11107,2008-01-11,5,"YUM! Really simple to make, and I just know my kids are gonna love them..thanks for sharing!"
140132,11107,2008-01-28,5,Oh my these are good.  So simple yet so tasty. Thank you for posting....Stephanie
189616,11107,2008-02-01,4,Did have to add quite a bit more water and would decrease the amt. of butter next time because we found it too greasy. Served this with recipe#37413 and recipe#84665
369715,11107,2008-02-01,5,"These were really good and easy to make. I made these exactly as written. The next time I make these, the only thing I would do different is to make a double batch :) Everyone ate these up and there was nothing left. They were so much better then packaged butter noodles. Loved them. I used the boullion and only 1/2 cup butter as suggested."
386849,11107,2008-08-26,4,"Nice flavor, but I had problems with the water evaporating.  I also had to cook a lot longer then expected."
13796,11107,2008-10-11,5,"Great way to cook noodles! Amazing full bodied flavor. I used only 3/4 of a stick of butter and it was plenty for our tastes. I added some freshly chopped parsley, too. I put a lid askew on the pot , too. ...  and lifted the lid to frequently stir the noodles so they would cook evenly."
37868,11107,2008-10-29,5,This is a easy 5 Star for me. I love pasta and butter and the chicken boullion is a for sure the best seasoning. I had everything on hand and was wanting something to eat. This is just as easy and fast as my hunger could take. Thank You for a fast easy snack. Hugs
400708,11107,2009-04-01,5,"WOW, so simple and perfect for DGSs, it's so rare to find something they really like and both will eat and they both asked for seconds with this.  A testament to it earning 10 stars.  I followed the directions exactly and used whole wheat noodles so even got some fiber into them.  Served with a hotdog and steamed broccoli and it was such a hit it was gone before I could get a picture.  But I will be doing this again and will make sure I do get one and post it then.

Thanks David for making this Nanna look good to her DGSs"
315055,11107,2009-04-10,3,"There was not enough water in this recipe, I did as instructed and continually stirred, but the noodles were crunchy even after heating longer then indicated.  I won't make this again, but would suggest if you are going to try this recipe to cook the noodles with the bullion and then add butter at the end.  I also noticed that it seemed there was too much butter as there was quite a bit of butter residue during clean up."
176615,11107,2009-04-17,3,"Even adding more water, this just didn't work for me. After stirring the noodles trying to get them cooked, some were a bit shredded. As the dish cooled a bit, it turned into a firm lump of noodles. I don't mind some extra butter here and there, but the amount in this dish wasn't justified in the result. Next time I'll boil the noodles, drain, and add some butter. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
371738,11107,2009-09-20,4,I started cooking this as directed only to find myself adding more water.  Then it seemed a bit too buttery so I added even more pasta.  The end product was a very quick and kid-friendly dish.  Will make again but with less butter.  Thanks for posting.
355637,11107,2009-12-28,4,Good!
768828,11107,2010-02-04,5,This was super good.  I've never made flavored noodles before.  I did use only 1/4 cup butter and was still really good.
540346,11107,2010-04-09,5,"This was so easy and very tasty.  I used 3 c chicken broth and ended up adding an extra cup of water at the end because the noodles weren't quite done and they were sticking to the bottom of the pan.  I also used 12 oz whole wheat egg noodles.  At the end, I turned the heat off, added some fresh grated Parmesan cheese, and put the lid on for a few minutes.  The family devoured it.  I will make again."
177933,11107,2011-02-23,5,"YUMMY... I did cover it like someone recommended and I had to add more water to get it all cooked, but as long as I know what I need to do... it's a keeper for sure!"
928301,11107,2011-08-02,5,"Very tasty.  I got unsolicited compliments on it from the husband and he even asked about ingredients in it and got seconds.  I just wished I could sprinkle something on it so it would look more like it had a sauce.  I saw that others put parsley, basil or black pepper.  I might try those for visual appeal.  The flavor was good without them though.  I'd add a third bouillon cube because I like the flavor & I about halved the butter because the amount seemed like a lot, but the flavor was still good."
394077,11107,2012-11-21,5,Very easy and very good.
969481,11107,2013-09-22,5,"I make my own vegetable stock with scraps I freeze so I always have plenty in the fridge. I like to use stock versus bouillon because it is less salty, but that is just my preference. We also like to add a generous amount of fresh ground black pepper to the buttered egg noodles.. YUM!"
128473,11107,2014-06-02,5,"Wonderful noodles.  We really enjoyed the egg noodles prepared this way.  Made as written but decreased the amount of butter used. Lovely noodles, buttery, creamy and delicious, full of flavor.  Served with Down East Oven Scallops and Roasted Sugar Snap Peas for a memorable meal.  Thank you so much for sharing this simple and easy to make treasure."
894666,11107,2016-09-08,5,"Such a great, easy side! Wasn't used to cooking egg noodles like this and definitely found other reviewers suggestions helpful and made sure to read recipe through twice. Used 2 cups of water and a large shallow metal pan. I used one Knorr cube which was I think larger than most other bouillon cubes. Stirred the whole time as another reviewer suggested, the noodles really did cook through all the way. These noodles were soooo good for so little effort! Thank you, gonna make some more of these asap!"
316717,66241,2008-03-21,5,very good! thanks for sharing!
59780,66241,2004-08-05,5,"— posted Jul 26, 2003,Made these for breakfast today as my last recipe for ""pick your chef"". I have never been very successful at making regular pancakes, but this recipe worked for me! I did make the first few a little thick but by the end I had mastered pouring the right amount of batter. I made these with whole wheat flour and the kids still gobbled them down. Thanks for this great recipe! ***updated I made these today for a special breakfast and served these with Strawberry topping recipe#59564, whipped cream and icing sugar. Delicious!"
230557,66241,2005-09-06,5,"I premade several baggies of this recipe using dry buttermilk and later adding the melted butter and vanilla - so we could eat these while camping last month.  Worked great!  But FIRST I'd made them at home - and everyone (me, 3 boys and dh) all agreed they were the best ever.  Really!  Just the right texture, no nasty after taste like packaged mixes have, cooked perfectly and look beautiful.  Yum!"
22015,66241,2005-09-13,5,"These were perfect.   Great flavor, nice and light, very easy to put together.   This goes into my ""must make again"" file."
175824,66241,2006-02-14,5,Excellent flavor. These were soooo good and flavorful. They taste the way pancakes are supposed to taste. Delicious and light.  I will never again use the box mix again. I followed the recipe exactly. Loved the vanilla. Thank you for sharing such a great and easy recipe.
169969,66241,2006-08-09,5,I originally made this recipe for Zaar World Tour 2006 and loved it! I have since made the recipe a number of times. I have decided that what I like best about this recipe is that the pancakes do not have an overwhelming flour taste like some recipes I have had in the past. The pancakes are light and fluffy and are good enough to be eaten without butter or syrup (although who in their right mind would do that!). Soooâ€¦.. Stack â€˜em high!!!  This recipe is great!
347822,66241,2006-10-28,4,Great pancakes - variations include 1 cup fresh blueberries for blueberry pancakes or 1 cup chocolate chips for chocolate chip pancakes.
173579,66241,2006-11-01,5,These were just wonderful.  The texture was just perfect!  Best I have ever made.  Will be making these many more times.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.
280166,66241,2006-11-20,4,These were very light and tasty.  I substituted 1/2 cup buckwheat flour for the all purpose and they were still light.  Thanks!
124249,66241,2007-04-16,5,"Made these for a breakfast I had with my two little granddaughters and they really liked these. They even ate them without syrup or butter. Thanks NimrodCook.

Bullwinkle."
265954,66241,2007-07-17,4,Very good pancakes.  I think the buttermilk makes all the difference.  Thanks so much for sharing!
37449,66241,2008-04-08,5,I made these for my DH for breakfast and he really liked them! I had a little taste and love the flavor! Thanks Nimz!
402559,66241,2008-05-01,5,"These were really good. I did double the sugar and vanilla and would do that again. Excellent pancakes, will make often, thanks!"
37636,66241,2008-05-01,4,"These were very good! I loved the flavor and they cooked up quickly and easily. I just hoped they would be a touch more tender although I tried to be careful stirring. Next time I won't use the whisk, just a wooden spoon. Thank you."
329638,66241,2007-08-27,5,"I had tried several other pancake recipes and thought they were great, but those now pale by comparison. These are fantastic- light and fluffy and tasty and perfect. I sour my milk with lemon juice first, since I hardly ever keep buttermilk on hand, and use 1/2 tsp of almond extract occaisionally in place of the vanilla- really smells wonderful, and doesn't affect the taste a bit. My new standard for pancakes- so good that DH was bragging to his friend about them! Thanks for sharing! UPDATED:  Since we are trying to reduce the amount of white flour we eat, I made these this morning with 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 c rolled oats and 1 tsp cinnamon for some fantastically great whole-grain pancakes.  I loved the taste- hearty and slightly nutty, and I felt better about serving my family pancakes!  I did keep all other measurements and ingedients the same, except for souring my milk with vinegar.
."
368078,66241,2007-09-23,5,"OMG - these were SOOO good!!  We have tried lots of different pancake recipes, and my DH said these were the best he's had by far.  I agree!  They were easy to make (and an easy recipe to halve, as we only needed enough for 2 of us), and were light and fluffy.  The directions were easy and clear.  Thanks for posting such a wonderful recipe!  This will be the one we follow from now on when making pancakes."
359220,66241,2007-10-14,4,"Not happy with my current pancake recipe (ie., Bisquick!), thought I'd try this recipe since I had some buttermilk left over from another recipe.  Just as easy as a mix and so much tastier!  I used all whole wheat flour instead of the regular as I was out, and had to add about another 1/4 cup buttermilk as I thought the batter was too thick.  My only complaint was that the pancakes browned long before the top had solidified enough to turn without it going everywhere.  So, not the prettiest pancakes, but smothered with margarine and cinnamon/sugar, very tasty."
461834,66241,2007-10-28,5,"This were delicious!!  Made them for today's Sunday breakfast along with sausage and eggs.  The texture is great and the consistency is right, in that it is not too thick or thin.  I started out cooking them at 350 on griddle but had to up it to about 375, probably just my old griddle.
Made for potluck tag!!!  Thanks Nimz for another great recipe!!"
64203,66241,2008-01-14,5,This is a great pancake recipe! I like that it yields several servings and that they are light and fluffy!
8688,66241,2008-01-20,5,"It's no wonder these delicious pancakes have so many 5 star reviews!  They are wonderful! Light, Fluffy and Flavorful!  I did not add the entire amount of flour (used approximately 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups) because we like our pancakes thinner than most recipes. I also prepared this recipe in my blender .  I find it is easier to pour the batter from the blender container when making pancakes or waffles. Other than that, I served with a side of crisp bacon, pure Canadian Maple syrup and blueberry syrup.  Thanks for the wonderful breakfast, Nimz!"
126104,66241,2008-02-05,5,"Well, thank you Nimz and thank you Williams-Sonoma.  I will no longer toss their recipes away.

I didn't follow directions closely.  I whisked my egg (I cut the recipe in half).  I added wet ingredients and whisked and then the dry.  I used a spatula to mix the dry into the wet.

I used butter on my saute pan and hoped they'd be OK.  They were incredibly delicious.

These will now be my favorite pancakes also.  Don't miss trying these."
383346,66241,2008-03-01,5,The only change I made was to use vegetable oil instead of butter.  And I omitted the salt.  These pancakes are delicious.  Thanks Nimz :)  Made for Zaar Star Game.
808027,66241,2008-05-18,5,These were the BEST.  I love buttermilk pancakes and these are light and fluffy.  I agree with the reviewer that said she doubled the sugar and vanilla (based on my kids' comments).  Will be making these again and again.
140132,66241,2008-08-04,5,"Wow, these are hands down the best homemade pancakes I've had.  I've tried pancakes from scratch, only to not like the taste.  These are delicious.  Thank you for posting."
426903,66241,2008-08-17,5,"We had these for dinner tonight and it was soooooo yummy! This recipe is so easy, that my husband actually cooked for me, which never happens. I think it is going to be my new favorite pancake recipe. Thanks so much for posting!!!"
226863,66241,2008-11-02,5,Fantastic!  Made for Football Tag Game.  I'm so glad I lost so I got to make this great tasting pancake recipe.  These are the lightest and fluffiest pancakes I've ever eaten.  Thanks for posting!
350750,66241,2008-12-06,5,Wow! These pancakes are so great.  I love how they turn out all fluffy. I didn't have any buttermilk but subbed sour milk. Thanks for a great recipe.
176615,66241,2009-01-18,5,"Excellent pancakes! Fluffy, light  and just the right thickness. Used a Calphalon griddle pan, so no oil was needed to cook. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
333017,66241,2009-02-07,5,"Ditto, ditto and ditto!  Fast, easy and delicious!!!  This is a winner!"
60260,66241,2009-02-24,5,Great recipe that was enjoyed by all.  I didn't use the mixer and just stirred it all by hand and it worked out just fine.  Cooked up easy and light and fluffy.  Thanks for sharing.
324621,66241,2009-08-30,5,Great!
126440,66241,2011-06-26,5,"Wonderful pancakes!  I had a bit too much oil in my pan and they were crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside.  Great with butter, syrup and sausage."
128473,66241,2012-04-03,5,"Excellent pancakes Nimz.  These were awesome, big, thick, light, tender and fluffy.  The pancakes were so flavorful.  I love buttermilk pancakes and these are some of the best I have ever tried.  Garnished with some melted butter and icing sugar.  They really didn't need anything else. Thanks for sharing another recipe that has gone into my keeperbox. Made for Spring Pac 2012."
540346,66241,2015-02-24,5,"These pancakes are so good and fluffy.  They remind me of why buttermilk is superior to milk in a pancake recipe.  I make pancakes about twice a week so trust me when I say I have tried many recipes!  If I don&#039;t have buttermilk, Pete&#039;s Scratch Pancakes is my other favorite recipe."
894666,66241,2015-10-11,5,"A batch of this makes 12 largish pancakes. I always add a teeny bit of water to thin the batter out a smidgen. These are so light and flavorful! Has been my go to recipe for a few years now, thanks so much for posting this. We were out off buttermilk this morning and I told my husband we could use a different recipe that didn&#039;t require it and he said absolutely not, he would rather go to the store and have these!"
198154,66241,2016-01-20,5,"Snow day! Freezing rain and ice turned a typically crazy week day morning into a stay in your jammies snow day.  No where to go and the family all home together called for a warm delicious breakfast.  With real homemade maple syrup on hand and buttermilk in the fridge, this recipe is the one that won out.  So glad it did.  I prefer waffles over pancakes, but these cooked up perfectly golden brown, light and fluffy.  I even substituted 3/4 cup of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour and you would have never known.  Pure pancake perfection!"
1179225,66241,2018-03-28,5,Classic! Wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for posting the recipe.
168462,155018,2006-02-27,5,"Great way to make broccoli. This is a very easy dish to prepare and will definitely make this way again. It is very flavourful. I did not use all the oil, just sprayed the pan with Pam. Thanks for such an easy recipe."
53932,155018,2006-03-18,5,This is a wonderfully easy way to make broccoli taste good!!!  Loved the extra flavor this method imparted.  Thanks for sharing.  Maybe I'll even eat broccoli more often.
222055,155018,2006-03-30,5,Oh Roxygirl! What more can I say!!! This is absolutely delicious! I will never microwave steam again!!!
307214,155018,2006-04-02,5,Excellent.  Another great way to serve one of our favourite vegies!
176615,155018,2006-04-04,5,"Simple and utterly fantastic! Also quick to fix and as easy as steamed broccoli but with tons more flavor. The color of the broccoli was beautiful and I think, overall, I prefer this recipe to its oven-roasted counterpart. I'll admit I usually throw stems away, but couldn't stop eating those tender little pieces. What a wonderful recipe! I'll use this again and again. Thanks, Roxygirl, for sharing it!"
184723,155018,2006-04-24,5,My new favorite vegetable is broccoli!!!! I used frozen because it was all I had and made exactly as directed and it was FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!  We all loved it and I bought more broccoli again today just to make it this way again! Thanks for posting!!!
47907,155018,2006-04-30,5,Very simple to make but the flavor is wonderful!  This is the way I will be making my broccoli from now on ~ I could eat the whole panful myself.  Thanks for posting a keeper!
95743,155018,2006-05-09,5,Unbelievably sweet.  Who knew? And it's sooo easy.  I may never steam broccoli again.
47559,155018,2006-05-24,5,Excellent way to cook broccoli and bring out a wonderful flavor.  I used olive oil and cooked until tender-crisp.  YUM!  This is a keeper.
147109,155018,2006-06-06,5,"I loved this method of preparing broccoli, but my husband was not a big fan (so we will post my review instead of his!)  This had a wonderful flavor, I think I will add some garlic next time though!  Thanks"
89831,155018,2006-06-19,5,"Simple and oh so delicious! My family loved this, thanks Rox!...Kitten:)"
60992,155018,2006-08-31,5,"What a great dish! I took some of the other reviewers advice and added some garlic powder in with the water. I was amazed at how cooked down the broccoli got, next time I will add more I think. And there will be a next time. I used farm fresh brocolli and the flavor was excellent. It went prefectly along side are Parma Rosa chicken and pasta."
135887,155018,2006-10-08,4,We liked the flavor and simplicity of this recipe other than we thought it was somewhat salty.  I don't know if the salt didn't get distributed evenly or what but I'll try it again with less salt.
207176,155018,2006-11-29,5,"This is only my rating-my kids thought it was too ""hard."" They also thought this was too lemony since I added garlic, butter and lemon as Stacywoo suggested. I served this with a sweet tasting meatloaf (the Yes Virginia one) which probably was a poor pairing since the lemon next to the sweet meatloaf was overpowering.  I would make it again as per your directions and maybe with some more garlic and or butter, but no lemon.  Thanks for a neat way to prepare broccoli!"
49304,155018,2007-01-30,5,"Very easy, tasty Broccoli.I used  olive oil instead of the vegetable oil & made the recipe as stated. Thank you for the easy recipe will be using the recipe often."
298447,155018,2007-05-16,5,"I have made this a few times and still can't get over how tasty, healthy, quick and easy this is.  I usually forget to separate the florets and stems, so might as well add fool-proof to the list!  DH and I were eating them like potato chips...betcha can't eat just one (serving)!  Thx!"
482376,155018,2007-11-19,5,I loved this. I am always looking for different ways to have broccoli. I really loved how crispy it turned out. Yummy and simple! Thanks. :-)
439797,155018,2007-11-22,5,Best broccoli ever!
222433,155018,2008-01-06,5,Great recipe! The color stays vibrant and they were still a little crunchy! Perfect! Thanks Roxygirl!
353131,155018,2008-01-15,5,"Can't believe I forgot to rate this! I have fixed this three times,so far and we are in love with it! DD(9) is extremely picky and won't touch many veggies. I convinced her to try it and she loves it! I gave some to mom last time and she called wanting the recipe!
Great, easy way to get it soome veggies!"
140132,155018,2008-01-17,5,"I made this last night for dinner.  Awesome, I loved it.  The broccoli was cooked to perfection.  I will be making this again especially this summer when our broccoli is in full bloom. The seasonings were just perfect.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe....Stephanie"
358796,155018,2008-02-03,5,"I used fresh baby broccoli. Very good somewhat salty flavor. The high heat adds a lot. Nice and tender crisp. Easy, will make again!"
252816,155018,2008-03-18,0,"I liked this recipe,my DH did not..So, no rating.."
64203,155018,2008-05-05,5,This was such a different way to make broccoli! Delicious and full of flavor!
386849,155018,2008-05-24,4,Preparing broccoli this way gives it a totally different flavor.  A nice change from the norm.  Thanks for posting!
125640,155018,2008-08-07,5,"Great way to make broccoli. Very easy to prepare. Absolutely delicious. I made no changes this time, but next time I would probably cook this in olive oil add some garlic powder or use garlic pepper seasoning instead of the regular pepper. Thanks for sharing. It's a keeper."
40961,155018,2008-08-12,5,It seems like once a week there is a news story about how great broccoli is for you. They should include this recipe with their story:) I followed your excellent directions using the garlic pepper and it turned out great. I think it's the best tasting broccoli I've ever had. Next time I make it I will make more than I did tonight. thanks for sharing.
74281,155018,2008-10-14,5,Another fabulous Roxygirl recipe! I actually used a 32 oz bag of frozen broccoli and doubled the sauce ingredients. Since I didn't have the garlic/pepper blend I used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon pepper. My Dad who HATES veggies ate a huge serving of this!
262312,155018,2009-01-07,5,"this was excellent and super easy.  i followed the recipe, except for using evoo instead of veg oil, doubling the pepper amount and adding garlic slices.  thanks for the keeper!  can't get any easier than this!"
394077,155018,2009-01-18,4,"Simple, healthy and delicious. What more can you ask for right? Great broccoli. A change from my regular stir-fry concoction. It went great with my fish and my family steaks dinner. Thank you."
377581,155018,2009-02-07,4,"This is a tasty, simple and quick  recipe for those all too frequent occasions when you donâ€™t have a lot of time. I used half broccoli, half cauliflower and added garlic. This one's a winner I know Iâ€™ll be making often. Thanks for posting!"
369715,155018,2009-04-02,5,Simple but AWESOME! I followed the recipe as written other then I used broccoli and cauliflower. I also used one tablespoon of olive oil and two tablespoons of butter. These were so good. Everyone cleaned their plate. Will be making this more often!
637486,155018,2009-06-18,5,What a great new way to cook broccoli!  This tastes so much better than steamed broccoli...thanks for posting!
470351,155018,2009-07-25,4,This was a very good method of cooking broccoli.  I still felt it needed some seasoning so I'll try this again and use another reviewer's suggestion of tossing it with sautee'd garlic and lemon.  Thanks for posting!
368078,155018,2009-08-03,5,"Yumm!!!  this is a 10 star recipe for sure.  It's so easy - I used frozen broccoli (all we had on hand) and didn't do any measuring - just eyeballed it.  Once done, I removed the broccoli, and minced 2 cloves of garlic, mixed with 1T butter in the pan until melted.  I then added the broccoli and mixed. Voila!  This is also good to mix with pasta for a full meal.  This recipe is a keeper!  thanks Roxygirl"
579298,155018,2009-11-04,5,"Delicious! A no-fail method for tasty broccoli! I didn't separate the stems and florets, I kept them all intact, and it still turned out lovely. Thanks!"
55729,155018,2010-10-29,5,"I went looking for this recipe in my reviews. I was *sure* I had reviewed it because I make it ALL THE TIME!!!! Whoops! This is so easy, and so good. There are really no words to describe how perfectly this cooks or how wonderful it tastes. I originally got the recipe from the magazine, which has a few pan sauces to go with it. I almost never use them, because the broccoli is so good plain and unadorned. Thank you for posting this."
400708,155018,2010-11-07,5,"Mmmmm, I love this recipe.  It was so easy and the taste is a whole new experiance in broccoli.  I added a teaspoon of crumbled bacon at the end and it threw this over the top. I made this when DGSs and friend was here to serve with recipe#3811687 and there wasn't a crumb left.  Made for Eating Right in the Photo Forum"
226863,155018,2011-03-16,5,"So, so fabulous!  I tagged this in I recommend and I'm so glad I found this recipe!  A definite keeper.  I did add garlic to the water mix, and used a bit more water.  Loved this!"
305531,155018,2011-04-03,5,"Nice broccoli dish. I love broccoli and make lots of it so this was a nice, simple change of pace. I added a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end and it was yummy. Thanks Roxygirl for a nice side dish. Made for I Recommend Tag."
68460,155018,2011-05-04,5,"I was looking for something different to do with broccoli, found this, made it and we loved it.  My husband is only a recent convert to broccoli and HE loved it so it's a winner in my book.  I made it as written but in the future will try some of the suggestions from other reviewers, such as garlic, red pepper, etc.  I love quick, simple, delicious and healthy recipes like this one!  Thanks for posting this Roxy :)"
456858,155018,2011-09-06,5,This is really good.  I won't be steaming my broccoli anymore...this is the only way to go!
37036,155018,2012-01-10,5,"We enjoyed this broccoli.  I used olive oil, but followed the directions exactly.  I think next time, I might add some garlic.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
285039,155018,2012-01-14,5,Quick and easy method to prepare broccoli.  The time was perfect for el dente results; watch it closely if you attempt to cook it longer.
2041603,155018,2012-01-16,5,Great recipe and easy to make! I just bought a head of broccoli at the grocery and used that. Worked wonderfully! I have always been a picky eater and never a fan of broccoli but my husband and I gobbled this up!
928301,155018,2012-02-23,5,tasty.  I used frozen broccoli--just got tired of steaming it.
133174,155018,2012-07-04,5,This recipe is all about technique.  It is so simple yet the end results is wonderful.  I used chicken stock for added flavor and would most definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks Roxy for sharing.
2549237,155018,2013-01-24,4,This is a really great technique for cooking broccoli. We love broccoli and eat it frequently.
373817,150384,2007-04-19,5,"5 stars all the way!! This soup is amazing!! I didn't have half-and-half, so I made the substitution and I also omitted the nutmeg. I can't wait to make this again! Thanks!"
68884,150384,2007-09-09,4,"This was easy and tasty. I did find I needed 3 total Tbsp of butter -- the onions soaked up the first, and I needed almost 2 more to get a good roux. I used only 1/8 c. of whole-wheat flour, and FF half & half. I didn't puree the broccoli but did dice it pretty small. It's not really like Panera's, but it's thick and hearty and it reheats really well. I'll very likely make this again."
47907,150384,2007-09-23,5,"Wonderful!!!!  I made this for lunch last week and it was so good.  I made as posted and did not puree it either ~ I like the chunks.  I think that if I had pureed it, I would have just used my stick blender.  It was easy to make and it hit the spot.  THanks for posting a keeper!"
894666,150384,2009-03-04,5,"deeelissshh! Cannot tell you how many times I made this recipe last fall, became addicted and had to cut myself off! Used fat free half and half, reduced fat sharp cheddar, and SmartBalance butter to great results. Don't be afraid of the nutmeg!"
285039,150384,2009-09-11,5,"This was awesome!  I forgot to add the nutmeg, but it was still good....I guess that just have to be the excuse to make it again!  Definitely on my keeper list."
111291,150384,2010-01-02,5,"YUM!!  I made this almost as posted.  Only had 1 c. of sharp cheddar, so I used some Velveeta instead.  To cut the cooking time in half, I sauted the onions first, then added the chicken stock, broccoli and carrots (finely chopped in food processor first)and boiled that while I made the roux in a separate pan.  After the roux thickened, I added the cheese.  To complete, I then just combined the veggies and roux."
439797,150384,2010-01-11,5,This was really good.   Very thick and I added a little extra milk.  The four of us ate every single bite.  Used 1/8 tsp nutmeg - next time will use the full 1/4.
140132,150384,2010-01-12,5,"So good.  I made this last night and it was so good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and blended half the soup and left half ""chunky"".  We loved this.  Its creamy and flavorful.  Thankyou for sharing this with us."
937635,150384,2010-02-23,3,We didn't really care for the soup. The nutmeg over-powered the other flavors and there wasn't the right amount of amount of savory-ness.
1365025,150384,2010-02-25,3,Personally I didn't care for it. It tasted alright but it was missing something cause it was on the bland side. I pureed it but that made for a grainy texture which I wasn't fond of. I'm glad I tried it but it just wasn't for me personally.
789516,150384,2010-11-05,5,excellent!  used 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 cup 1% and it was a good consistency.
1133190,150384,2010-11-24,5,I've made this before and had trouble with it curdling but this last time I was careful to keep the heat lower the whole time and didn't have that issue at all.  We love this soup!  I use frozen broccoli to make it quicker.  Thanks so much for posting!
15521,150384,2011-02-21,5,"This is delicious soup that my family gobbled up!  My husband abhors ""cheese food"" products so there are many Broccoli Cheese soup recipes that he would not approve of.  I was thrilled to find this one using real cheese, and it all melted together so smoothly.  I used my immersion blender to break up some of the veggies, but tried not to pulverize it so that I could still identify them.  I used extra sharp cheese and I thought the flavor was just right! Also used fat free half and half with good results! I will be making this again!"
236170,150384,2011-05-17,5,This recipe is delicious! I love Panera's soup - but this is way cheaper :) We serve this with crusty bread and there usually aren't many leftovers.
103876,150384,2012-03-11,5,"This is the Best!  My daughter and I made this together and it turned out perfect.  We used fat-free half & half, light velveeta cheese and frozen broccoli.  It was just the right thickness and flavor.  We will make a double recipe next time.  Thanks for posting!"
145352,150384,2012-09-30,5,Really good!!! And really not hard to make.
187373,150384,2012-10-06,5,"Fantastic soup!  Don't know if it tastes like Panera, but it is delicious nonetheless.  Even the toddler ate his vegetables! : )  I didn't have half and half, but used one cup evaporated milk and one cup skim milk.  I really enjoyed this recipe and it reheated pretty well also.  Will make again; might be my go-to broccoli cheese soup.  I like to add a little cooked rice in my soup also."
280166,150384,2012-12-27,5,This soup was very good!  Thanks for posting!
222564,150384,2013-01-11,3,"Lovely, tasty soup. Made with full fat milk, boiled the veggies from the start with the soup, so halved the cooking time. Would leave carrots out next time and increase broccoli."
53932,150384,2013-01-18,5,"Excellent.  Just as a personal preference, I would use less nutmeg next time."
126440,150384,2013-01-22,5,Perfect thickness and creaminess.  Loved it.  Put mine in the blender and served with Russian Black bread.
8688,150384,2013-01-27,5,"This is an excellent recipe.  I cannot compare it to Panera as making it by this recipe is the only way I have experienced this soup.  I made it healthier by using Earth Balance in place of butter, using Better than Bouillon (vegetarian no chicken base) with water instead of chicken stock.  I also used my immersion blender to cream the soup after the vegetables were tender.  The flavor  and texture of this soup is perfect for our taste!  Thank you so much for sharing!  I will definitely make again!"
768828,150384,2013-02-14,5,"Yummy.  I did make a couple changes.  I used 1% milk and Velveeta cheese and added a little garlic.  I think the nutmeg adds a lot.  In any case, I will be making this lots.  My DH who doesn't eat cooked broccoli even had a dish and said it was good."
1581225,150384,2017-03-15,5,"I've never tried Panera Bread, as we don't have it here (Australia). I made this exactly as written, didn't change a thing. It was absolutely amazing! I love broccoli and cheese so I enjoyed the flavour. The consistency was great. My husband also loved it. I'll be seeing this recipe in my recipe box to make again."
368078,150384,2018-03-08,5,"This recipe was a win!! I'm going to list my changes based on our family's dietary needs in case it's helpful. We added more carrot (an extra cup) and I ran it through the food processor rather than shred it. We then partially saut&eacute;ed the carrots with the onion as we wanted them to be done. We also used frozen broccoli florets as some of the reviewers said the fresh wasn't cooked through. This worked great and we will do it again!! Also, we used dairy free butter and cashew milk (in place of both the cream and milk). We also used gluten free flour and upped it to 1/2 cup and added in an extra couple tablespoons of butter, since other reviewers have said it was too thin. Our soup turned out thick and creamy. The flavor was excellent, and I loved the addition of carrot (who can complain about adding more veggies?! ;). This will be a regular on our dinner rotation."
51011,13949,2002-09-05,5,"this is an easy tasty recipe!
i threw my cube steaks in the crockpot without defrosting(forgot to pull them out of the freazer), and they still tasted great.  next time i will add mushrooms! thanks for posting!"
37868,13949,2002-11-04,5,This is winner here with my family of 6 now. The meat was so very tender and the gravy was out of this world. I followed the recipe and do not want to change one thing. Thank You for a keeper in my home.
27643,13949,2003-02-15,5,"Wonderful!! I made this exactly as posted. The meat was so tender, the gravy is delicious. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. We were very impressed with this SO easy recipe!! Thank you Britt!! This will take it's place among our favorites."
59473,13949,2003-07-03,4,This was a very tasty recipe. I loved the gravy and the steak just fell apart. I will make this one again. Thanks
101034,13949,2003-09-08,5,This is for sure a keeper. It was a big hit with the family. It was so easy to prepare and tasted so so good!!!!
74652,13949,2003-09-23,5,"I seasoned the steaks with S&P AND garlic powder for a little extra flavor.  Put it in the crockpot and had a wonderful ""home cooked"" meal waiting for us when we got home from work.  Easy and yummy!  Will make this again and again!  Thanks"
64934,13949,2003-09-24,5,"Wow.. so easy and so very tasty, too!  I made this exactly as stated and the meat was very tender.  I just left it on low in the crockpot for about 9 hours.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  Lots of gravy left!  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!"
39835,13949,2003-09-29,3,This was very easy and good for a no-work dinner but I found the meat to be a bit bland after cooking for so long in the crockpot. I agree with Christina it did remind me of school cafeteria food.
37449,13949,2003-11-06,5,I picked this recipe for the Chef of the Day game and my husband thanks you! He loved it and said I must make this often! I used mushroom gravy mix  and added a few potatoes chopped up instead of makintg mashed cause I was gone when he came home. So his meal was all in one pot! Thanks so much for this easy recipe!
184723,13949,2005-03-27,5,I don't normally like cube steak... at ALL.  Now this one I liked.  We loved it and it was so easy and all those leftovers were an added bonus!  Thanks so much for this great recipe...made it exactly like your recipe said and the flavor was perfect!!!
189616,13949,2005-04-23,2,"I am really shocked out of 48 reviews no one commented on the cook time! 6-8 hours on low for pre-browned cubed steak (it is almost pourous afterall)! It was almost done before it was cooked for 7 hours, My DS's complained they couldn't even spear it with their fork, it broke up into a crumbled/hamburger consistency, and no my crockpot doesn't need to be replaced, The sauce we found to be bland, and I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic. I would recommend that it be cooked 3-4 hours on low. My DH comment-Well it's still meat, just not a steak."
173579,13949,2005-07-15,5,"This is a very good crockpot meal.  Quick and easy, and very tasty.  Thanks for posting. "
203325,13949,2006-04-07,3,"We also found this to be a little bland.  The meat was also a little dry, but again, I think it may have been over cooked.  I definately am going to buy a crock pot with a timer if I don't get one for Mother's Day!"
43083,13949,2006-04-10,0,I am going to take off my 3 star review because I made this back when I was a new member and I didnt brown the meat first before cooking it. Maybe thats why it didnt turn out. So Im taking my low review off:) Will try this again soon and re-review it. Thanks!
32772,13949,2006-05-04,5,Fabulous! My whole family loved this recipe.
355637,13949,2007-10-21,4,Steaks were very tender and I added some mushrooms and served over mashed potatoes. Yum!
371738,13949,2007-10-23,3,"3 stars because we just ""liked it.""  I think 6-8 hours is too long for cubed steaks that already have been browned.  The ""steaks"" just fall apart.  I did love the fact that it was easy and required a handful of ingredients though.  Maybe I'll try it again without cooking so long."
140132,13949,2007-10-31,5,This is one of our favorite meals....total comfort food. (and easy too)  I made this on game night and my girls finished the meal before we got home.  Very easy and very good.  I didn't find it to be too long to cook but my crock pot is an older one and it cooks a little slower....thanks for a great meal.....Stephanie
264017,13949,2007-12-22,5,"Absolutely awesome! I cut the measurements in half since I had only 1 lb. of meat, but sure wish I had the full 2 lbs.!! The meat was so tender and flavorful, my husband couldn't stop saying, ""MMMmmmm"". Served it with roasted green beans and mashed cauliflower. Thanks Chef!"
218535,13949,2008-06-03,2,I was quite disappointed after reading all the good reviews. My gravy was quite watery. It does not have a good flavor.
847160,13949,2008-12-03,4,good
74281,13949,2009-01-13,5,"The steaks turned out fork tender and the gravy was so good that my DH scooped the leftover gravy into a bowl and ate it with a spoon. This is a very versatile recipe as I didn't use flour or pre-fry the steaks, just dumped them in the crock pot then poured the gravy over them. I discovered too late that all I had was a package of Beef Gravy so that is what I used."
227607,13949,2009-02-17,5,"This was loved by all.  I browned the cube steaks then put in the crockpot.  I used onion soup mix and added some sweet onion, garlic, salt, and pepper.  Instead of cooking for the 6 to 8 hours  I cooked on low for about 3 hours.  The meat was not falling apart but could be cut with a fork.  It was perfect!!!  I did not want it in tiny pieces from being cooked too long."
158086,13949,2009-03-04,5,What an easy great recipe this turned out to be...great weeknight dinner that tasted like you slaved all day...
124190,13949,2009-03-24,5,"Fantastic! This is the first cube steak recipe I could get my oldest son to eat. The rule at my house is that you have to try a bite, and after his one bite, he asked for more! Delicious, tender cube steak. I subbed brown gravy for the onion gravy mix. I make this recipe in a skillet too, but will use the crockpot from now on. SO easy, and SO good!"
369715,13949,2009-11-02,4,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I cooked mine on high for 4 hours. We poured the gravy over stuffing. We all enjoyed this.
187373,13949,2012-10-06,5,"Pretty tasty! I was wanting something different for dinner and saw some cube steaks at the store, so came back and found this recipe.  Had never made cube steaks before, but they turned out so tender and the gravy was delicious!  I added some cut up onion and cooked for 2 hours on high, then down to low for another 2.  Perfect served with mashed potatoes for the extra gravy.  Mushrooms would make a great addition (but unfortunately, DH doesn't like them).  Edited 10/12: Have made this multiple times and is always delicious!"
32058,13949,2014-08-06,5,"Made as directed only doing following changes;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brown gravy mix instead of onion gravy mix.  3T onion flakes, 2 onions sliced thin and garlic powder. &lt;br/&gt;Cooked 6-7 hours on high.  Was not mushy like other reviewers stated.  BF loved it!&lt;br/&gt;Served with mashed potatoes and saut&eacute;ed mushrooms.  Will make again.&lt;br/&gt;The smell while cooking was incredible!!"
59780,79944,2004-03-09,5,This recipe is very similar to Ruzicka Chicken recipe#66488 and my family just loves! The bacon makes the chicken so tender and the presentation of thisis even good enough to share with company! I had no idea that you could make this ahead of time and just bake when needed! Thanks so much for sharing this great idea.
119466,79944,2005-01-12,5,"This was almost effortless, but tasted fantastic. Use good quality bacon & you just can't mess it up. I did not sprinkle with salt & did not feel it was lacking. Thanks!"
7108,79944,2005-11-17,5,"Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half and made 4 large breasts for 2 adults and 1 child, hoping to freeze the leftovers for an upcoming housesitter.  The leftovers were in high demand and got eaten the next day, before they made their way to the freezer, so I ended up making more the next day for freezing.  I served this with some chicken flavored rice and broccoli.  We loved this dish; thanks for posting!  A definite keeper. "
132383,79944,2005-06-08,5,Wow!  I have never had a chicken breast so moist and tender!  We made half a batch and put them in the freezer.  We decided tonight was the night to try them and we were so excited with the taste.  We used two slices of bacon and used Adobo in place in salt.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  It is a keeper and I will be spreading the word about this one!
149363,79944,2005-09-16,5,"Tish, you obviously have another winner on your hands!
I made this last week, but had far too many so I froze the rest fully cooked.
I just flash froze them on a cookie sheet and then put them in a zip-lock bag. We thawed them out last night and they were just as great as the first time around! So they DO freeze well when pre-cooked.
Thanks for a great addition to my OAMC cookbook!
"
101823,79944,2005-10-07,4,"I downsized this recipe for only 2 chicken breasts, as I was only serving my husband and myself.  3 tablespoons of cream cheese seemed like a lot for each breast, and I reduced that amount to better suit our tastes.  I also could see no reason for the added butter or salt and omitted them.  My chicken rolled nicely and didn't need toothpicks for securing.  The bacon added a nice flavor dimension to the chicken and creamy filling.  This was simple to prepare and made an easy meal for a weeknight."
51011,79944,2006-09-04,4,"I thought that this was pretty good, but dh didn't really care for it.  He thought that it was too salty (guess from the bacon). He can be picky when it comes to new things though.  It was easy to put together (I used thin chicken cutlets).  Thanks for sharing."
389431,79944,2006-12-10,5,"Oh my this was yummy!!
We found a really good sale on chicken and were looking for ways to prepare it...  this was PERFECT!!
My husband just raved and has requested that this be in our rotation!
Thanks so much for the recipe!!"
355637,79944,2007-01-13,4,"We just had this and it was really good!! I also turned the chicken half way through the cooking time and the bacon was perfectly crisp! I put garlic and some basil, thyme, and oregano in some regular cream cheese. My hubby said I definitely need to make this again!"
140132,79944,2007-01-30,5,I made this as written using thin sliced chicken breasts.  This is delicious although very rich.  My whole family enjoyed this very much.  I am thinking this is a good entertaining recipe as it is a beautiful and delicious. Thank you for a great dish for everyday and special events.....Stephanie
229524,79944,2007-03-25,5,"WOW, are these every good.  My husband absolutely loved these.  They are easy to throw together.  Thanks for a great recipe Tish."
240552,79944,2007-04-26,5,This dish is outstanding!  I cooked all of the chicken and froze half of them as another reviewer did.  Thank you so much!
251917,79944,2007-08-09,5,Delicious and easy to make - restaurant quality!
269331,79944,2008-06-04,5,"Wow, wow, wow!  Can I say WOW again!  This was so easy to make, but definitely company worthy.  I halved the recipe and used chicken cutlets slightly pounded.  THANKS FOR POSTING!  Iâ€™ll be making this again for sure!"
125640,79944,2008-07-13,4,"I cut back to only two tablespoons of cream cheese per chicken breast and sprinkled with garlic salt instead of regular, but otherwise made as posted. Baked up nicely. Easy and good. Thanks for sharing."
32058,79944,2008-09-15,5,"This was agred by all as a 5* recipe.  I changed it up a bit as personal pref with 1# spinach frozen/thawed, 6 oz. cream cheese (blended with spinach) and a spice blend on top consisting of season-all, salt pepper and garlic powder.  I baked in over for appprox 55 minutes.  Delicious and super quick once you get everything together!"
286851,79944,2008-11-16,3,"After all the good reviews and with how easy this was, I was hoping to like it more. It wasn't bad, my family just didn't really care for it. There was so much cream cheese, and I didn't think it added a whole lot to the dish. It was very easy to make, with simple ingredients and directions, however, I don't believe we'll make this again. Thanks for sharing, however."
44383,79944,2008-12-06,5,"Excellent. Didn't change a thing although my bacon was the extra thick stuff so didn't wrap as well as regular bacon would have.  I also didn't need to broil, the bacon was done perfectly for us without broiling. The cheese mixture (which made more then 3 tablespoons for each breast) wanted to squeeze out of the breast during rolling but I managed with the help of several toothpicks. Somewhat messy to prepare but we both loved these breasts served with Thai rice and a veggie. We could only eat 1 each for dinner so I still have 10 in the freezer for future meals. That makes me deliriously happy so thanks for posting this."
489552,79944,2009-01-12,5,"This was delicious !!  I made a tray of about 10 good size chicken pieces and there is no left overs.  My girls immediately asked me to make this again soon.  I did take a photo, but it looks like you really don't need more photos.  :) Great and easy recipe.  thank you...."
185285,79944,2009-01-28,5,"I can't say enough about these. I did the OAMC version and used low fat ingredients, including center cut bacon and Smart Balance Light butter. Absolutely fantastic - and also great with Recipe #149547."
227607,79944,2009-03-20,5,"Oh WOW!!! This was wonderful.  I used some chicken breasts from a bag I had and did not pound them out.  They were thinner pieces anyway.  I just put some of the cream cheese mixture(I used regular cream cheese and mixed in dried onion, lots of garlic, and pepper) on the top then wrapped bacon around the whole pieces. I left the butter out and just sprayed the foil with butter flavored pam. I also did not need to broil them at the end because the bacon was already crispy.  My whole family LOVED this.  The kids who usually only eat a tiny bit of chicken each ate a whole piece and part of another."
55729,79944,2009-03-21,4,"I cooked 5 of these for dinner tonight and froze the other 7. I wasn't sure about the cream cheese staying in because my technique was very sloppy. However, they turned out fine and tasted good."
1365025,79944,2009-11-16,3,"The chicken and bacon part was real good, I didn't care much for the cream cheese part. I like cream cheese but not with chicken I guess.
I took the grease from the bacon and added it in the water of the green beans I was cooking. It gave the green beans a nice flavor."
318235,79944,2010-08-16,3,We thought that this was just ok. It seemed like just too much meat - and we are meat eaters! Thank you for something easy and different though.
1072593,79944,2010-09-25,5,Da'yum'...this was good!
242484,79944,2011-04-02,5,Wowza!  This was SO good!!  Big hit with the teens!
371738,79944,2013-10-06,3,"It was ok. Some liked them, others didn&#039;t.  Doubt I&#039;ll be making them again."
222564,79944,2011-11-28,5,This is most magnificiently delicious chicken ever!
2549237,79944,2013-01-10,4,This was really good.  I scaled it down to 4 chicken breasts and put 3 bacon strips on each breast.  My husband REALLY loved this and my 3 picky kids and I all liked it too.  This is definitely staying in my recipe box.  Thank you Tish.
207176,79944,2013-11-20,0,I love how easy this was to make and I liked it. My older son was the one who requested this and he gave it a 5 but the rest of us gave it a 4. Thanks for an easy dinner that everyone was so excited to try!
251917,264017,2009-04-19,5,Top faves of 2008 tag: Delicious and refreshing drink! Everyone loved it!
37449,264017,2009-06-09,5,I loved this drink! I used cranberry/grape juice. Thanks! Made for PRMR.
172369,52035,2006-11-04,5,"Great recipe, everyone is asking for the recipe. Made a directed and they are perfect! Thanks for a keeper."
64583,52035,2003-02-07,5,"These are SO yummy!  I've never made them myself, but a friend of mine made them over the holidays and I could not stop eating them!  Great for a real Oreo lover!"
101823,52035,2003-12-25,4,My hubby loved these.  They were a good addition to my Christmas goodie trays.  Very easy and the presentation (with the chocolate drizzle garnish) is a nice finishing touch.
13796,52035,2004-08-15,5,Decadent little treats. I cut back on the cream cheese to make them a little firmer. I used 7 ounces of cream cheese.
146486,52035,2004-08-19,5,These are delicious little treats but I bet you can't eat just one!  I used reduced fat oreos and light cream cheese and they turned out fine.
29014,52035,2004-10-16,5,"To be perfectly honest, I did not taste even ONE of these!  Took the whole batch to my Jazzercise class for Sweetest Day, and they were history.  So I assume they rate five stars.  Made a dozen copies of the recipe and those disappeared as well!
Like some others mentioned, these are a little messy to do, but easy enough with just the four ingredients.  I would defintely do these again as they are very pretty on the serving plate, too.  Thanks for sharing this chocolate treat, NN!"
60260,52035,2004-12-22,5,These are so......easy and don't look it!  My kids helped me make them and following another recommendation made them on the smaller side. I used a sandwich bag to drizzle the white chocolate over top and it looks so cool. Very impressive - with no fuss.
138429,52035,2005-01-04,5,I added these to my Christmas tray ----wonderful. They will be there next year as well. I did dip them in white chocolate and drizzed with dark . Thank you for a wonderful recipe
58836,52035,2005-12-15,5,I haven't really made these but I have had them to eat.  YUMMY!! Oh my they are soooo good.  You have to have one.
222433,52035,2005-12-16,5,Thanks New Nana for making me look like super chef!! My family was sooo impressed! These turned out beautifully for me! Never dipped in chocolate before. I am excited to try again with some of the different variations.
199020,52035,2005-12-23,4,"These are pretty good, but a little time-consuming to make. Most of my family like them; some of us thought they were too sweet.  "
103876,52035,2006-02-05,5,"A friend of mine brought these to our house for Super Bowl Sunday.  I had never heard of them, but was in love the minute I tasted them.  They were very rich, but oh so delicious.  And I was delighted to hear how easy they were to make."
168462,52035,2006-11-08,5,"I took these to a charity bizaar and they were gone in no time. I used my food processor to mix the oreos and cream cheese. Then, I dipped them in meltd milk chocolate chips and then drizzled on white chocolate. Delicious and sold out at the bizaar too. Thanks for the recipe."
187373,52035,2006-11-11,5,"These were really good and can be really pretty for a dessert tray.  They are pretty messy to make. They are pretty rich, so I would recommend making them slightly smaller than I did! DH and friends loved them. Thanks!"
142559,52035,2006-12-17,4,"Very good recipe, however, I ran into a problem or two: I had a hard time dipping the balls with a toothpick and found that the toothpick would either cause the balls to split or would tear the tops of the balls, leaving oreo crumbs in the white melted bark I was dipping them in. I ended up using a two tined fork that was in my fondue set to hold the balls and dip them. Worked a little better. I did let them set in the fridge overnight before I dipped them.  Tastewise, these were very good, a little messy, but will make again. Will try with mint oreos next time!"
222055,52035,2006-12-20,5,"Nov. 25, 2006- I made several desserts for Thanksgiving, but these were the first to disappear (and fast). The guest raved over them. They looked so professional they thought I had bought them. I dipped some in white almond bark and when I ran out, I used melted white choc chips. I drizzled all of them in semi sweet choc. Easy, Messy, and Worth It!!! Definite Keeper!!! Thank you New Nana!!! Edited to add Nov. 30, 2006- I will be adding these to my Christmas Trays and I will be drizzling in red and green. I am sure they will be a beautiful addition. I will also be packaging them in some small bowls, saran wrapped with a bow. for gift giving. Then Easter, I will drizzle them in pastels. Valentines Day- red....they sound like a KEEPER, don't they!?
Edited to add December 20, 2006
The red and green icing didn't work, but Christmas sprinkles did and so easy! I took the to work an my many co-workers devoured them, overly complimented me and said they should adorn the window of a specialty shop. There has not been one person that has tried these that did not like them. I will try to not rate these again :). I just get too excited when I come across a ""Lifer""! :)"
89831,52035,2006-12-27,4,"I made these for my xmas holiday tray, warning!... they are extrememly rich and sweet, so I rolled them into very small balls, they were enjoyed by my guests over the holidays, thanks for sharing New Nana!...Kittencal:)"
318235,52035,2007-02-04,4,These were good and pretty easy to make. Instead of just doing balls I made mine in the shape of footballs and dipped them in the chocolate first. I then used the white chocolate to make the lines on them. They were a hit at my superbowl party. Thank you very much for a fun recipe!
188119,52035,2007-03-10,5,"Couldn't find almond bark anywhere, so I used ghiradelli white and milk baking chocolate bars and they still came out great!  They went quick at a a potluck I took them to.  It looks nice alternating with the white chocolate and milk chocolate drizzle and vice versa.  One person suggested I try this with other kinds of cookies... I'll have to try that sometime.  Thanks!"
22015,52035,2007-04-16,5,"I""m sorry, I thought that I had reviewed these last Christmas.   Simple, easy and so tasty.   It takes no time or effort to put these together.   Hardest part is letting them sit to cool.   Thanks for posting."
400420,52035,2007-11-04,5,"Do you need another 5 star review?  :-)  Easy to make and super yummy! Yes, dipping the balls was a bit tricky, especially when a few fell apart, but they still turned out great! Thank you!"
240552,52035,2008-01-01,5,"WoW! Super easy and gobbled up quickly! I made these for a fellowship at church. I used white chocolate and semisweet chocolate chips along with a little paraffin, melted, to dip. Also, I used a mini cookie scoop to get a nice size. Thank you!!  This recipe made it into our book#179809!"
229850,52035,2008-03-23,5,"Now I know what all the fuss is about! I have trying to get around to making these since before Christmas!  They are wonderful ! Covered first batch in the white almond bark, then second in the chocolate, both were delicious, depends on who you ask, which they liked best, but either way, they are superb !! Took these to Easter, they were great because I made them the day before to take hassle out of the morning rush ! I love to take a few things snack on, and these were very well recieved!"
359220,52035,2008-12-09,5,"My sister has always been the oreo ball queen in our family, but I wanted to surprise DH this year (they're a favorite).  If you chill the dough well before rolling and then again before dipping, they're a dream to work with.  I only used milk chocolate to dip them in and did double dip them to give a even coating.  So tasty, just the right mix of cream cheese, oreo and chocolate- make them small bite sized ones- they're RICH!"
350750,52035,2008-12-27,5,These little morsels are good! I made these for Christmas goodie plates.  They were very easy to make.  Thanks for something new and good!
33159,52035,2009-01-04,5,"Darn these addictive little things!!  lol!!  I did have to make a change in the recipe, though, as I had no idea where to find almond bark - I just used white chocolate & semi-sweet chocolate & dunked some candies in the white & some in the dark. I actually preferred the ones dipped in the semi-sweet.  But, the candies are nearly truffle like & fairly easy to prepare.  They do get soft rather quickly at room temperature but they get gobbled up fast so that's not much of a problem."
180090,52035,2009-01-07,5,"I made these for a party I threw and everyone loved them and I had many requests for the recipe! I used the food processor to crush the oreos and to blend the cream cheese til it made a dough. I used about 3 bags of white chocolate chips to cover the balls, and had to double dip some of them to get them competely covered. It's a messy recipe but well worth it! I called them Oreo Truffles to sound more appetizing! Thanks for posting!"
529278,52035,2009-10-01,5,Yum!!!!
93006,52035,2009-12-15,5,An easy Christmas classic.
177933,52035,2009-12-22,5,Yummy!!  We loved these!!
368078,52035,2009-12-23,5,"We've been making these for years, and they are always a big hit!  We have found it's easier to chop up the oreos in a food processor, and then hand mix them with the softened cream cheese.  We also don't usually chill for the hour in between (always to short on time) and they turn out fine.  It's fun to do them for holiday themes, and drizzle colored almond bark on the top (i.e. red & green for christmas, red, white and blue for the 4th etc).   Thanks for posting this one New Nana!"
579298,52035,2009-12-30,5,Wowza! These were GONE in no time flat! I split the recipe and used half Golden Oreos (covering them in the brown chocolate) and half Regular Oreos (covering them in the white chocolate). What an amazing recipe!
1365025,52035,2010-01-01,5,"This recipe comes off the Kraft recipe site and yes they are very good. I love all the pictures that were taken, they are all so wonderful."
140132,52035,2010-01-03,5,"I made these with my DD's yesterday and they are so good.  I usually make them for Christmas but we ran out of time so this is the one recipe they said we HAD
to make still.  Thank you for posting, this is truly a keeper."
264017,52035,2010-12-07,5,"Absolutely a 5-star winner and so easy! I took another reviewer's advice and put the Oreos into the blender on ""chop"" until they were the crumb consistency I wanted. I then used my KitchenAid mixer to blend the crumbs and cream cheese, used a cookie/melon baller to make perfect round balls, and set them all in the freezer til solid. I had no problem dipping them into the melted almond bark and still keeping them in perfect form. It didn't take long to thaw out and everyone loved them, even with using Reduced Fat Oreos and 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese."
38643,52035,2010-12-19,5,"We made these with our grandchildren tonight.  Fun time was had by all. Five stars, I say!"
1133190,52035,2010-12-23,5,You can't beat these!  Love them!!  We just used Ghirardelli dark chocolate and white chips to dip in and they worked just great.
198154,52035,2011-05-31,4,"I made these for an upcoming baby shower at work.  I made as directed except I used peppermint Oreo cookies.  I also put a candy cane in the food processor and ground it until fine.  The red and white blend into a pink. After I dipped the Oreo balls in white chocolate, I sprinkled them with the candy cane powder. I will update my review after the shower and let you know what everyone thought.  They look so good, it will be hard to resist them until then!<br/>Updating as promised. These were a hit at the shower. I would give them five stars based on taste alone, but deducted a star because they were so time consuming to make."
1179225,52035,2011-12-10,5,"I can't believe I've never reviewed these. Everytime I make them they disappear. I make mine smaller only because they're so rich. I agree with others that it's best to crush the oreos either with a rolling pin or food processor, then mix with a mixer. I found using two toothpicks is the easiest way to get them covered with chocolate and then pulled out of the chocolate. They turn out so pretty. Thanks for posting this great recipe!"
64642,52035,2011-12-11,5,Easy-peasy to make and any Oreo-type sandwich cookie will work in this recipe.  I used cookies from the dollar store.  Make sure and let them harden on waxed paper. I put them on a cake rack and they hardened to the wire mesh.  A brief time in the oven softened the chocolate enough to enable me to remove the balls to waxed paper.  I had a little trouble with the white chocolate/baggie thing as it melted the plastic.
222564,52035,2012-12-01,5,Fantastic!
1581225,52035,2016-11-20,5,"I made these some time ago but only just reviewing now. I don't remember having any trouble making them, apart from making a bit of a mess. I did use chocolate chips to melt rather than bark which I couldn't find. I remember they were very, very rich and tasty and enjoyed by everyone."
4470,8739,2001-07-24,5,I don't know if I enjoyed the quacamole or the intro to this recipe the most.  Both are great!
9869,8739,2001-09-07,5,"The chips were warm, the beer was cold, the guacamole was great!!  =)"
35526,8739,2002-11-05,5,You are sooo good Mark.  Loved everything about it.  I used cilantro.  I also put the avocado pit in the bowl to keep it from turning brown...works everytime.  Thanks for another good recipe ;)
22015,8739,2003-05-02,5,"Excellent - it was the talk of the luncheon, Mark.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Now I have to print it off and email it to everyone that asked."
54678,8739,2004-02-22,5,Big hit at the mexican supper nite with friends. People who never ate avocado before were asking for the recipe. Keeper - Repeat!
68960,8739,2004-02-28,5,"Excellent, very easy to put together and very tasty.  Lime juice instead of lemon is a great idea.  I served as suggested with icy cold beer."
37036,8739,2004-03-19,5,Great guacamole!  Just like the Mexican restaurants serve here in Texas!  Wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for sharing!
26512,8739,2004-03-29,5,"Outstanding guacamole, Mark! I couldn't find any decent limes and ended up using 2. I served this with your hot sauce and chips and it was so delicious, we couldn't stop eating! This was really easy -- I like guac a little on the creamy side, so I just whirred in the food processor and then added the tomato and onion. Another great recipe, thank you!"
88099,8739,2004-12-26,5,"I know you probably don't need another 5 star, but this was the best Guacamole I have yet to make.  Everyone really enjoyed.  Took it to our family Christmas gathering and it went over well.  Thanks for posting."
93006,8739,2005-03-14,5,"Can't get any better than this...and every good Texan should know how to make guacamole!  I only do 1-2 mashes with the potato masher, so that it is good and chunky, and the only thing I do different (sometimes) is to add about one T. sour cream for consistency, and I seed the tomatoes.  You are right on, Mark, with this one!"
185285,8739,2005-03-26,5,Like this needs any more ratings... I had been looking for a duplicate of what our fav restaurant does and this was it - with the addition of a bit of orange.
68884,8739,2005-03-28,5,"I am not the biggest guacamole fan, but my DH is & I made this for an enchilada dinner with friends. It was a hit. My avocados were not quite ripe & didn't mash well, so I ran part of the dip through my mini processor. I used the jalapeno, 3 pinches of kosher salt & a Roma tomato. It's very fresh-tasting, very ""summer-y."" Very delicious. Thanks"
119466,8739,2005-05-05,5,"Well, along with the many previous reviewers, we thought this was just fantastic! Thanks for posting the recipe."
59163,8739,2005-05-07,5,"Made this as one of the appetizers for my son's 24th birthday. It was a sure hit, there wasn't a bit left.  I prefer to keep the avocado chunky and like a good amount of cilantro.  Great recipe!"
51011,8739,2005-06-11,5,Wow! This recipe was so easy to put together & good tasting too!  Only change was to add 1/2 tsp of ground cumin.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
188119,8739,2005-09-13,5,"I think I might have added too much lime, but otherwise it was pretty good from what I was told (I don't like guacamole).
"
47559,8739,2005-12-18,5,"This is the same guac recipe I've been using for more years than I'd like to admit to.  I always use a bunch of green onions rather than regular onion.  After tasting, and depending on the size of the avocados, and limes, I sometimes add more lime juice."
158086,8739,2006-03-27,5,"This was the best guacamole I have ever had, and I just got back from the Riviara Maya and ate this stuff every day there...I will be making this alot"
177933,8739,2006-10-06,5,"Wow, I couldn't get it back into the fridge for the 30 minutes because people were devouring it.  We served it as an appetizer with chips and then on top of our fajitas.  I left out the jalepeno, it was fabulous!  Thanks"
52125,8739,2006-12-30,5,Great guacamole! Turned out perfect and tasted really good. Thanks Mark H.....
231054,8739,2007-01-28,4,Very nice!!!  I omitted the cilantro and the jalapeno.  I didn't want to take away from the flavor of the avocados.  I did add a little of the homemade salsa I made -- but went pretty light on it for the same reason -- I wanted people to just enjoy all the avocado flavor.  I also just used the juice of a half of a lime.  Perfect.  Thank you for the great recipe.
180090,8739,2007-03-11,5,"This is very similar to how my Grandma makes guacamole and it is THE BEST! This was my first time making homemade guacamole, very easy to do and tastes way better than store bought. I added about 2 tablespoons of canned diced jalapeno for extra spice. Thanks for posting!"
359220,8739,2007-03-25,5,"Great guac that focuses on the nutty, buttery avocado and not too many add-ins.  I have to admit that I just used this recipe as a base...3 avocados, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 lime total, 1/4 minced onion, 4 cherry tomatoes, salt and 1/2 minced jalapeno.  DH and I finished the whole bowl before we could stop ourselves...will defnitely use again and again this summer!!!  Viva la guacamole!"
58836,8739,2007-05-26,5,"Yummy!!Made for a staff inservice yesterday and it was all gone.  I think this is the best guacamole I have had.  Didn't add the cilantro as that's my personal preference, or the jalapeno, just didn't know how hot everyone would like it.  Otherwise I made just as written.  Making again tonight for a mexican supper.  Thanks!!"
520150,8739,2007-07-01,5,"We served this at our dinner party last night.  It was very good.  People were eating it with chips & salsa & cheese dip before dinner.  Then were adding it to their mounding plates during dinner.  They didn't realize I had made it, until someone said it had a little kick & I said I had put diced jalapeno's in it.  They said ""YOU made this!""  I'm taking that as a complement.  :)  All the recipes I used are in my menu ""Mexican Dinner Party"".  Thanks for a great recipe, I will never buy guacamole again."
182624,8739,2007-07-08,5,"Awesome.  The perfect guacamole!  I like guac that allows the flavor of the avocado to shine and not get overpowered by other ingredients.  I left out the tomato and forgot the cilantro (shocking since I'm a serious cilantro lover, but I was also in a serious hurry with 30 people about to arrive at my house)!  It was simple and delicious!"
74281,8739,2007-12-17,5,I made this to go with my beef enchiladas that I smothered in Mark's quite excellent Recipe #42094. This Guac lives up to it's rating and to it legend. I'll never use another guacamole recipe again!
286851,8739,2007-12-26,4,"Very good, thanks for sharing."
140132,8739,2008-01-28,5,OMG....this is so very good.  I love guacamole and this is the BEST.  DD and I couldn't quit eating this.  Thank you for posting this excellent recipe...Stephanie
426903,8739,2008-02-04,5,"I am not a big fan of guacamole, however I used this recipe to make a layer of my 7 layer bean dip, and my superbowl party-goers LOVED it! This is the first time I had every made guacamole, and will hold on to this recipe for the future. Thanks for posting."
497077,8739,2008-02-06,5,"Love it!!! I've made it enough now that if I just want enough for DH and I, I use 1 avocado and adjust the ingredients accordingly---still turns out great! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!"
52262,8739,2008-02-16,5,"I made this guacamole for a party.  I used 2 roma tomatoes, white onion, some cilantro, and about 1 jalapeno pepper diced.  This was a very easy recipe to make.  I am not found of guacamole as a dip so I wasn't a good judge of it.  I let the party people judge it and the huge mound of guacamole was quickly gone.  I was told it was delicious.  I served it with tortilla chips."
229850,8739,2008-05-07,5,"This so reminds me of Guacamole I had in Texas !! Fresh simple ingredients, not a lot of stuff masking the flavor !!  I loved it ! Thankyou so much for the memories! Also the great recipe!"
60260,8739,2008-05-26,5,"This is how I learned to make Guacamole on a trip to SanteFe, New Mexico.  Love it!  My only thing to add is I always use Kosher salt and do quite a bit of taste testing because you need just the right amount of salt - too little and it's not right.  Lime juice is the only way to go."
125640,8739,2008-06-26,3,"This was very nice. I halved the recipe. It was quick to make. Good and fresh-tasting, but nobody was super-excited about it. I didn't have any peppers on hand, but I'd definitely be sure to get jalapeno if I decide to make this again because I think it needs it and I'd double the garlic and maybe add a little oregano for my family's tastes. Thanks for sharing."
195589,8739,2009-05-14,5,"OMG, I could eat the entire recipe by myself, it is that good! I use a red onion, finely diced. I know the lime is to keep the color, but it adds a nice zip as well. Thanks for posting, Mark. H."
37449,8739,2008-08-14,5,"I scaled this recipe down for 1 avocado. I love cilantro, but didn't have any so left that out. I had it on 9-grain toast and it was so yummy! Thanks Mark!"
189475,8739,2008-11-30,5,"Delicious! The best guacamole I've ever had. Here's a tip for mashing the avocados: I had a hard time mashing them with a spoon so I scooped the avocado, garic and lime juice mix into a ziploc bag and just squished it around using my hands. It was a lot easier than mashing it with a spoon. Just make sure that all the air is out of the bag or it might pop open."
8688,8739,2008-12-21,5,So delicious and so simple to prepare on the spur of the moment!  I served with recipe#131176. Thanks Mark for sharing this recipe : )
894666,8739,2009-03-04,5,"have found the perfect guac recipe. Will look no further. The ultimate compliment came from my boyfriend who lived in Mexico as a child, ""I think this is the best guac I've ever had."" The lime lends a freshness/zippiness that other recipes lack, makes my tongue do the tango! Thanks Mark H!"
55729,8739,2009-06-29,4,"Really easy, really good. It does make quite a lot. The lime juice did keep it green without being sour. I liked it without the jalapeno and cilantro, but I might add some heat next time just to see."
126440,8739,2009-08-09,5,"Great Guacamole.  I made it for 2 and it went fast.  Our jalapeno was spicy, oh so good."
312577,8739,2009-09-24,5,Simple and delicious to make.  I used Recipe #161717 BBQ Chicken and Kittencal's burger buns and made scrumptious chicken sandwiches.  My BF will never allow me to buy guacamole again!  This is a great recipe.  Thank you.
172369,8739,2009-10-30,5,Thanks for sharing
486718,8739,2009-11-02,5,Wow - this was really good.  I made exactly like written and it came out perfect.  Even my DH who claims not to like guacamole ate it.  Thanks!!
1269015,8739,2009-12-06,5,"I served this over the ""cheese spinach quesadillas"" and alongside the ""wonderful salsa"" recipes found on 'zaar. The whole ensemble was a huge hit, but this was my favorite part. This is a recipe we'll be coming back to again and again!"
174991,8739,2010-02-09,5,I made this for a Super Bowl gathering and it went over very well. Great combination of flavors.
368078,8739,2010-06-24,5,"This may not need another 5 star review, but we just had to add our praise - this was excellent!  We made just as directed, except we halved the recipe.  Yummy!!"
844554,8739,2010-08-09,5,This was very good! It was just the 2 of us so I only used 1 avocado and left out the cilantro. Thanks for a great guacamole recipe.
937635,8739,2010-09-28,5,DELICIOUS! Thank you so much for the awesome recipe :) I have officially found my go-to!
1179225,8739,2012-12-10,5,The perfect classic guacamole!
98919,8739,2016-03-04,5,"Wholly Guacamole...this was good stuff!!!  This will be my &quot;go to&quot; guacamole recipe from now on.  My family had this for a Cinco de Mayo/Supermoon party this year and it was a hit.  Like another reviewer said, they were sold on trying this by the story that went with it.  Loved it!!  I read somewhere that if you put the avocado pit in with the guacamole that it also helps it from turning brown along with the plastic wrap trick on laying it right on the dip.  I put a couple in and the next day it was still beautifully green.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!
UPDATE March 4, 2016: I found a new way to keep it fresh and green looking. When ready to store, forget the pit and plastic wrap technique. Instead, push down guacamole to get all the air out and smooth top. Add about 1/2&quot; of LUKEWARM water and close with a tight fitting lid. Sounds weird but it works. On the 3rd day it was still green. Do this every time you get out and use."
92886,66121,2004-03-14,4,"I can't be totally fair to this, because I did one major thing differently, I marinated the meat for about eight hours in a mixture of broth, soy sauce and sherry.  I think the marinating was a good idea, but eight hours was way too long, I think I will try 4 or less next time.  The rest of the recipe I followed fairly closely.  It was very tasty.  I made stir fried napa cabbage and red peppers to serve along with it and dumped the extra sauce from the meat on the veggies."
91392,66121,2004-08-15,5,"DH gives it a 5.  I think it made three good sized servings, it would have been a lot for two people. Different and nice."
145352,66121,2005-09-01,4,"Good, but a little time consuming! Served with rice and stir fry vegies. "
188119,66121,2005-09-22,5,"It's pretty good, but I tripled the recipe and I got very impatient dusting the meat with cornstarch, so after rushing it I ended up with globs of fried cornstarch on each... maybe it would work with flour too?  Next time I should take my time... oh well, thanks!"
278113,66121,2006-02-26,4,"We really enjoyed this meal. It was a *bit* too sweet for us, so next time I will reduce the brown sugar a bit. But we WILL be making this again...YUM!"
52125,66121,2006-10-10,4,We enjoyed this recipe although it was a little to sweet but tasted great.  Thanks Susan Dillard....
55578,66121,2006-12-20,5,"Loved it, served it with brown rice scattered with peas.  I doubled the sauce because I had 2 pounds of beef, but I recommend against it, there was tons of sauce left over.  Tx for the recipe."
316717,66121,2007-02-14,5,this doesn't taste like any mongolian i've ever tried at restaurants...and i've tried plenty...but i'll still give it 5 stars since i thought it still tasted good and my kids seemed to really like it.
8688,66121,2007-04-22,5,"Tish, we enjoyed this immensely!!  I used one ribeye steak and two filet mignon   which was so tender and delicious in this recipe.  I think I ended up using too much cornstarch, which I will make a point of not doing next time, because the sauce became too thick, but delicious none the less.  This is a very simple recipe and very quick to prepare serve with rice.  I will be making this again and again!  Thank you so much, Tish : )"
182624,66121,2007-05-10,5,"TEN STARS!  This was delicious and tasted just like PF Changs version.  I must admit that I felt I wasn't sure what I was doing (frying beef? definitely new for me), but not because the recipe wasn't super easy (it was!), but because I'd simply never made chinese food in this manner before.  It was very, very easy and really tasted delicious.  There was just enough for my husband and myself, but I'd consider doubling it and making it for guests anytime.  This is going to be a frequent rotation at our house.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!"
286851,66121,2007-06-24,4,"Loved this easy-to-make recipe. Everyone in the family, including my two little picky toddlers, enjoyed it. Tastes very close to the original from PF Chang's. Husband thought it was a tad salty, but overall very good. Most Chinese dishes are a bit salty, so I didn't think it was overly so. You may try using reduced-sodium soy sauce. We really enjoyed the texture of the steak--using the cornstarch before frying gives it this unique crisped-up texture. Really yummy! Served with white rice and cooked (tender-crisp)broccoli, which we mixed in with the sauce. Will be making it again."
331557,66121,2007-07-14,4,We loved this recipe.  We doubled the sauce and triped the garlic and ginger but left everything else the same.  Tasted very authentic and will definitely be a keeper in our house.  Thanks for sharing.
250031,66121,2007-08-19,5,Excellent! Five stars from my family! They asked me to add it to the list of family favorites! We will be making this again. I doubled the meat quantity but kept the sauce quantities the same and it was perfect for us. Also I used light brown sugar because that's what I had on hand.
255338,66121,2007-09-12,5,"Seeing that I was serving other dishes along for dinner, I halved the portion of this dish. Big mistake!!. My son now proclaims this dish to be his favorite beef dish. After reading the review, I did add sesame oil, and reduced the sugar a little... and I would add onions next time because I had seen them done this way in many restaurants. Thank you very much for sharing."
158086,66121,2007-11-01,4,"This was very good and very easy to prepare, I did use sugar free brown sugar and thicken it up with cornstarch...turned out great.."
520150,66121,2007-11-27,5,"Very nice.  Both dh & I liked this alot.  I used broccoli instead of green onions (he won't eat them).  I added some spicy chile flakes to the left overs & we liked it even better.  Thank you very much for this easy, wonderful recipe that I will be making again & again."
229850,66121,2008-01-21,5,This was really good. We did enjoy it. Thanx for the addition to my cookbooks.
207176,66121,2008-02-13,5,"This is so good all the time! My kids always want this and I have made it so many times that I decided to review it again! I use some sesame oil and sometimes peanut oil. I start with step #6-#9 preparing the meat and while it is sitting with cornstarch, I go to step #1 and set up the sauce thru to step #5. I heat the sauce and cook the meat in batches and then the timing is perfect for draining the last of the oil from the meat pan and adding the sauce. I have added snow peas for a change. Also works great with 1/2 cup brown sugar. Thanks for a family favorite!"
177933,66121,2008-02-15,4,"This was really great, we didn't think it was like PF Changs Mongolian beef though, to us it was more like something we really love at a different restaurant called crispy beef.  Anyway, we will make again thanks Tish!"
285039,66121,2008-06-25,4,"This is a wonderfully tasty recipe; but I found it tedious to make.  I was not sure if the taste was going to be worth the effort, but it certainly was.  After removing the meat from the sauce, I tossed some steamed broccoli in the pan and tossed it in the sauce as well.  Wonderful! Thanks for posting."
37036,66121,2008-09-09,5,This was delicious!  I was in the mood for something different and this was it.  I followed the directions and wouldn't change a thing.  I served this over white rice along with sauteed zucchini.  Thanks Tish. :)
172369,66121,2008-10-08,5,"Made this as directed and served on a bed of rice. Very good, thank you for sharing."
377039,66121,2008-12-20,5,"I've never had Mongolian beef and I've never eaten at a P.F. Chang's, but this was delicious. I made it just as directed (subbing dried chives for the green onions) and served over beef flavored rice. My husband thought it was a little too garlicky, so next time I'll cut back a little, and I thought the chives didn't really do anything, so next time I'll leave them out (husband's allergic to onions, hence the substitution). This was a fantastic meal and we didn't find it too sweet at all, as some others have. It was perfect. We served the sauce over the rice, which was delicious as well. Thanks for a great recipe, Tish!"
969481,66121,2008-12-20,5,"I""ve had this dish at PF Changs and this recipe is very close. Delicious as well. You really must use flank steak here or it just isn't the same. I also added some red chili paste and diced white onion and green bell pepper just as a personal preference. Howver, the recipe is excellent as posted. Thanks!"
447123,66121,2009-01-02,5,Just made this and everyone gave it a thumbs up. It was easy to follow and I had most of the stuff in my pantry already. At first I thought I wouldnt have enough sauce for the 1 pound and a quarter flank steak I had but I had more than enough. Really this is much much better than any chinese resturaunt I have been in. Thanks Tish for a wonderful addition to my weekly menu!!!! You ROCK!!
439797,66121,2009-01-20,5,Delicious!  I doubled the recipe.  Used fillet mignon because that's what I had.  Sliced it very thin in my food processor.  Used 2/3 cup of sugar for a doubled recipe.
189475,66121,2009-01-29,5,"This was delicious, quick and easy. I will definitely make it again sometime. I saved some time by buying the beef that is already cut into strips, and I also used my deep fryer to cook the beef. I cooked it all the way through in the fryer and skipped step 16 and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!"
39301,66121,2009-01-31,5,Fantastic recipe!  The whole family loved it.  We'll be enjoying this one often.  Thanks for posting.
88099,66121,2009-03-06,5,"I haven't had P.F. Chang's Mongolian Beef, but this was very good.  It did take me longer to make it than stated but I was also making egg drop soup.  I missed having some vegetables along with the meat.  May add that next time and some crushed red pepper flakes to kick up the flavor for us.  But made as written and was very pleased.  Thanks Tish."
222564,66121,2009-03-11,5,"5 stars all the way! I did use 1 tbs ginger, as we just love it, and only 1/2 cup brown sugar, but these are just personal preference."
80998,66121,2009-03-13,5,We loved this.  i followed the recipe exactly except decreasing the sugar to half cup.  i was glad i did.  Hubby requests adding a little crushed pepper next time.  Thanks for a yummy dish.
74281,66121,2009-04-27,5,"Really a fantastic recipe! I doubled the recipe and served it over rice noodles. Had to leave out the green onions and added a couple of dashes of sesame oil to the sauce. Tish suggests you ""Leave the excess sauce behind in the pan"" but I spooned most of it over the rice noodles which soaked up the sauce and made this dish destined to become a regular in my house!"
394077,66121,2009-10-12,5,Awesome Tish!! 10 Stars!!I only used 1/2 a cup of sugar and it was enough.  Everything else was the same.  GREAT!!! dish.  Thanks for sharing.  Saved a bunch $$$ from not going to P.F Chang.
140132,66121,2010-01-06,5,"Fantastic!  I made this tonight and my family and I devoured it.  I did read the reviews and cut back on the brown sugar, by half.  The meat is so tender and flavorful.  I added one whole bunch of green onions and it was perfect.  I served this with fried rice and hot and sour soup.  thank you for sharing this restaurant quality meal."
121185,66121,2010-01-08,5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
810787,66121,2010-01-19,5,This was amazing. I LOVE to eat at PF Chang although I've never ordered this dish. We served over a bed a brown rice and used sirloin steak...loved it!
400708,66121,2010-01-28,5,"This is one great recipe, fairly easy to put together and a wonderful taste.  Never had it at PF Chang's but sure enjoyed it at home.  I did follow Williamwhy's suggestion and added a small amount of sesame oil and then marinated the meat in the sauce for 2 hours prior to frying.  I think it did help to increase the flavor level.  I think next time I'll just pan fry the beef also as deep frying didn't seem to make much differance.  Served this with steamed rice and a side of recipe#12563 - YUMMY!!!"
1365025,66121,2010-03-01,4,Since I was only cooking for one I cut the recipe in half. I took the advice of the other readers and didn't add that much brown sugar. I slowly added small amounts of brown sugar until I was satisfied with the taste. Instead of serving it with rice I used noodles and used just enough sauce to moisten them.
60260,66121,2010-03-13,5,"We love PF Chang's and have to travel out of state to enjoy it so this copy cat recipe was a real treat.  With other's suggestions, I slightly froze the meat (about 20 minutes) before slicing - worked well.  My meat was closer to 2lbs so I doubled the sauce.  I added 1 tsp of sesame oil and a some red pepper flakes.  DELISH!   I do want to note that when cooking the sauce - it really doesn't ""thicken up""  I was concerned and added wondra powder to get it a little thicker.  Mistake - after frying the meat the sauce thickened up HUGE after adding it back to the meat, so my sauce was a little on the gooey side - too thick.  My fault - won't happen next time.  Don't leave the sauce behind in the pan - it is so good to have extra with your rice!  Leftovers taste just as good the next day.  This is a keeper - thanks for sharing."
1133190,66121,2010-07-15,5,"This recipe was great! My husband, especially loved it. I'm pretty sure that it would be at least nearly just as good to just stir fry the meat to cook it rather than going to the trouble of frying it.  I'll try it that way next time. The sauce was excellent! I added just a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for some heat."
1506604,66121,2010-03-31,5,"YYYYUUUUMMMMM
It was so good, restaurant style all the way and clear directions (which is highly appreciated). The only thing is it was a little too sweet so the sugar can be lessened to a 1/2 cup. But besides that, WONDERFUL!!"
1269015,66121,2010-08-31,4,"I made a tofu version of this, which was really good. Thanks for sharing!"
176615,66121,2012-04-03,5,"The family loved it! Tastes just like the original. I doubled the recipe and would highly suggest doing so. Easy to make. Thanks, Tish, for sharing the recipe!"
1179225,66121,2012-11-14,5,"Totally satisfied the craving for PF Changs!  I was craving Mongolian beef like CRAZY! I'm completely ignoring the nutritional facts, because I had to have it. I used the whole bunch of green onions and used less brown sugar and it turned out great! Thanks for sharing the recipe."
298447,66121,2013-12-31,4,"Great dish...can&#039;t compare to PF Chang&#039;s version, but stands great all on its own!  Thank you!"
620763,66121,2014-01-07,3,"With all the great reviews, I was expecting something more. I added broccoli and this ended up tasting just like plain old beef and broccoli.  It was OK, but I probably won&#039;t make again."
1581225,66121,2015-07-08,5,"This turned out very well. Lovely flavour, not too difficult and DH enjoyed it. I like the suggestion of putting the meat in the freezer for 15 minutes to make it easier to slice thinly."
265954,66121,2018-05-26,5,Delicious recipe. My only tweak was to use 1/2 c. of brown sugar instead of the 3/4 cup. Great balance of flavors--not too tangy or salty. I served over white rice with artichoke on the side.
136997,80536,2005-01-18,5,This was fabulous! Very rich tasting. I added a little more garlic as we love it. Served with the egg noodles as suggested and a side salad. YUM!
68460,80536,2005-04-23,5,"Very nice stew!  I made this exactly as written, using a Galena Cellars Country Red for the wine.  We had it over Yukon gold mashed potatoes with some biscuits.  It was a very comforting meal on this cold, blustery April day!  Thanks for the recipe Ev, it's a keeper :)"
93006,80536,2005-06-12,5,"Made this quite some time ago, and forgot to review - I loved it, although DH did not like the sweet taste....however, you have to expect that with the hoisin sauce.  I thought it was simple, delicious comfort food with a delightfully different twist."
188119,80536,2005-09-20,5,this was really great and it made the kitchen smell wonderful while it was cooking!  I didn't change a thing.  Thanks a lot!
158086,80536,2005-09-26,5,Made this for Sunday dinner...turned out very good...I put in a little quick tapioca the last hour to thicken and it turned out perfect.
177933,80536,2005-10-14,5,"Wow, this was incredible.  First let me say that my husband does not like beef stew and the only reason I decided to try this is the hoisin, which he loves (oh, and the 22 5 star reviews were also in infulence).  He thought this was wonderful and definately wants it again and often.  He even said it was guest worthy, which one does not usually say of a stew.  I only used 2 1/2 1bs. of stew meat (already cut up) which worked out just fine because we love lots of sauce.  I used a fabulous bottle of 2001 BV costal cabernet, which was also wonderful.  I followed your directions completely except that after adding the carrots I cooked for an hour because the carrots took that long to get the way we like them.  I also added a couple of handfuls of frozen peas at the end.  In my mind I think mashed potatoes should go with beef stew, so I made potatoes and egg noodles.  I must add that the flavor was way more enhanced by the noodles and I won't make potatoes with it again.  Like other reviewers I did not need to add the cornstarch it was perfect without it.  Thanks so much for sharing what is a new family favorite."
132764,80536,2005-10-24,4,"This was very satisfying. I seared the meat and carmelized the onions and then put everything into the crockpot for the day. I had to use a lot more than 1 tbs of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but I think it was because of the low heat I used. I think next time (and there will be a next time) I will use a better wine. Like some of the other reviewers, I too added garlic and mushrooms. Thanks for sharing this. "
230557,80536,2005-11-07,3,"Extremely sweet!  My husband gave it a 4, my kids wouldn't eat anything but the carrots. It doesn't taste bad, it's just over poweringly sweet.  I think, and husband agrees, that the sauce would be better used in a side dish, not as the main part of a meal - a little goes a long way.  I followed directions exactly except reduced oil to 1T.  Served with noodles. I like sweetness but this was just too much for us."
182624,80536,2006-11-14,5,"This is a terrific stew!  We served it over mashed red potatoes and it looked beautiful.  Definitely something I would serve to company, and stew isn't something I would usually even consider being in that category.  I think it would be even better with thick-cut mushrooms...yum!  I was about 1/4 cup short on the wine, but it still tasted great to me!  Baby carrots did the trick for me - no cutting and they look better - IMHO.  The parsley at the end is what makes this dish look so pretty, so don't leave that out.  My husband took leftovers to work for lunch the next day and he enjoyed it even more.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!"
207176,80536,2007-01-06,4,I thought the sauce was very good.  I think it would work well with brisket too. My youngest son didn't like it much but my older one gave it a 5 and his friend liked it too.  DH said it was good but for stew he prefers a traditional brown sauce variety. Thanks for posting.
52262,80536,2007-01-30,5,"Purely delicious!  My husband and I loved this stew, but unfortunately the kids didn't eat it.  I used 1 tablespoon less olive oil while sauteeing the onions and an extra clove of garlic.  Like another reviewer suggested, I added the carrots and all of the wine in Step 8.  I cooked the stew for 45 minutes at this point with the lid on.  Then I cooked the stew with the lid off for between 15-30 minutes until the carrots were close to done.  I did need to thicken the liquid with the cornstarch mixture followed by finishing cooking until carrots were completely cooked.  I can't wait to make this recipe again!"
175824,80536,2007-08-13,5,"What a delicious recipe. My home smelled wonderful as this was cooking. Our Councilman rang the doorbell to let us know what was going on in our Ward, the first thing he said as I opened up the door was ""something really smells good in here"". I added mushrooms and celery. Next time I am going to put a few potatoes in also. Thanks Evelyn for a wonderful recipe."
8688,80536,2007-12-16,4,"We enjoyed this so much.  The beef was nice and tender and the sauce had a surprise sweetness which enhanced the flavor of the stew.  I used baby carrots which helped ease the prep work and served with the suggested side of buttered egg noodles.  Next time I make this, I will reduce the amount of the hoisin sauce.  Thank you so much, Evelyn!"
189616,80536,2008-01-15,5,"Delightful! I used the crockpot and it took me awhile to get the gravy thickened, I could not stop going back and forth to the crockpot to keep sampling the gravy. Great flavor! Served over egg noodles and with recipe#90151"
369715,80536,2008-01-25,5,This was very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as far as the ingredients but I put everything in the crock pot and cooked it for 6 hours. It was so moist. It also smelled so good when I came home from work. Everyone really enjoyed it.
315055,80536,2008-03-13,3,"It took a lot of work and the end result was okay....it was quite bland and we ended up dumping on a lot more salt and pepper.  I gave the rest to my hub for lunches, as I refused to eat it."
316717,80536,2008-05-25,5,this was a hit w/ the fam. my husband couldn't figure out what the new secret ingredient was but he assumed it had a slight bbq flavor. so i let him think that and didn't mention the hoisin sauce. kids loved it so this will definately go into their favorites file. i on the other hand still prefer the traditional beef stew. but overall this was a great recipe.
146047,80536,2008-08-14,5,"I really enjoyed this beef stew, which I modified to suit the ingredients we had on hand. I used white wine rather than red, and just 1 c rather than 2 because if it were too ""winy"", my son would balk. I also added 2 lbs of halved gold new potatoes along with the carrots, and used one 28-oz can whole peeled tomatoes so my son could easily avoid them. This was a great one-pot meal that went well with crusty bread, and it's terrific as leftovers too. Thank you!"
774665,80536,2008-09-01,5,Tasty! I added pearl onions and cooked it for seven hours on simmer. The meat fell apart and the gravy was really nice. I served it on mashed potatoes with peas.
68960,80536,2008-09-06,5,"Ev, this was great, thank you.  I wanted it to slow cook as I had to go and get the girls from school so ended up cooking in the oven on about 125C for a couple of hours.  I'm also not keen on carrots so instead used some diced sweet potato and about 1/2 hour before serving threw in some frozen peas and didn't end up thickening it.  Served in some Aldi brand yorkshire puddings which were frozen and just needed heating up in the oven.  Great recipe for a cold night."
138429,80536,2008-09-26,5,Great stew!! Definately will make this recipe again. I served this with mashed potatoes. I used about 1/3 cup hoisin sauce which was perfect for our tastes. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
74281,80536,2008-12-21,5,"Having never heard of Mahogany Beef Stew I wanted to experience this recipe with no modifications (unusual for me). SO although I did double the recipe, I made no other changes. It was so full of flavor and everyone loved it served over egg noodles. with Recipe #116849 it made a very nice meal for our early family Christmas dinner."
222564,80536,2009-03-06,5,Unique with some hoisin sauce and very delicious!
637486,80536,2009-10-22,4,"I followed another person's suggestion and made this in the crock pot.  I just put all of the ingredients in at the beginning and then added the cornstarch at the end....I did use 2 tablespoons.  We thought that this would have been 5 stars, but we said it was a 4 because it was a bit too sweet and not enough salt.  Next time I will leave out a bit of the hoisin sauce and see if this helps.  Thanks for sharing and we will be making this again!"
126440,80536,2009-10-23,5,Great stew.  I made half a recipe and it was perfect for the two of us with a little left over.
55729,80536,2009-12-19,2,"I had only 1/4 c. left of the ""critical ingredient"" so I apologize if that skewed my results. My husband and son did not like this, and I thought it was just OK. I found it a little too sweet. Sarahbug liked it but also remarked on the sweetness (I don't know if she thought it was a negative). Also, the meat needs to be browned in batches to avoid ""boiling"" - the juices will evaporate when smaller amounts of beef are browned at a time (I ended up having to drain the meat in order to brown the onions). Also, my carrots did not cook enough."
1506604,80536,2010-04-18,5,"Really good, wish the sauce was a little thinker but honestly it is really tasty and sweet without the taste of sugar.  Great over mashed potatoes and I add some mushrooms to the sauce. Awesome!"
847160,80536,2010-07-20,3,It was an ok stew
1122161,80536,2010-12-09,5,"I had to use a recipe from the internet for hoisen sauce but this still turned out really good. The beef was really tender and flavorful. I did add 4 regular size potatoes and a few mushrooms, but other than that made as written. Excellent stew! Thanks for posting!"
362983,80536,2011-03-19,5,"This was a fabulous beef stew!! I used a little less hoisin sauce than called for, and followed another reviewer's suggestion of placing the stew into the oven after adding the wine and herbs. I put it in at 250 for a little over 3 hours, then finished the rest of the recipe on the stove. I added celery and potatoes along with the carrots, cooked it for another 25-30 minutes, and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!"
55578,80536,2011-04-09,5,"Wonderful!  I used 1/4 hoisin, added peas, baby potatoes and button mushrooms.  What great flavor.  I also coated the beef in flour before browning, that way I didn't need to add the cornstarch."
81611,80536,2011-11-29,5,Did not have wine; used beef broth instead. Agree that the flavor is rich and wonderful with the hoisin sauce. Will try with potatoes next time.
191533,80536,2011-12-10,4,"I thought the hoisin sauce made this slightly sweet; not my preference. But it was such a nice saucy stew that we enjoyed it anyway! I didn't have time to stand over the stove, so I put everything in the crockpot. I didn't even shred my beef roast- put it in whole and turned it on Low for 6 hours. Then I removed the beef and let it stand while adding the cornstarch mixture to the crockpot. (There's more liquid in crockpot cooking, so I tripled the cornstarch mixture- perfect.) I shredded the beef and put it back in the crockpot, had it on high for another hour. Perfect! Served over MASHED POTATOES! Yum!"
789516,80536,2012-01-03,5,"This was the best stew I've ever made.  I had to half the recipe (not enough meat) but it ended up being enough for my husband and I with some (rationed) leftovers.  I used tiny cubes of beef sirloin (sold as fondue style meat) and browned them in batches to make sure they had lots of colour.  Removed the meat from the pan and carmelized my onions.  After adding the wine (all at once) and everything aside from the carrots I simmered for 3o minutes, then transfered the pot to the oven and cooked at 250 for 2 hours with the carrots added.  At this point the meat was falling apart tender and the flavour was so rich. I skipped the cornstarch as it was thick enough without. I served this over mashed potatoes, and tomorrow I will serve the left overs of whole wheat egg noodles for lunch."
140132,80536,2012-02-08,5,Oh my goodness this is wonderful.  I made this tonight with some homemade bread and it was delicious.  It had a distinct flavor from the hoisin sauce that is like no other stew I've made.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us.
969481,80536,2013-09-18,5,Loved it. Was perfect for a cool fall day.
456858,80536,2014-01-19,1,"Didn&#039;t care 4 this at all.  But, I will admit, MAYBE, just maybe I did something wrong.  I am saying that because of the great reviews from others.  Mine came out sweet :(  IDK if that was due to the Hoisin sauce or because I used a fruity (sweet) red wine?  Regardless, I won&#039;t be making again. :("
103876,80536,2014-07-13,5,I absolutely love the flavor of this stew.  It is rich and satisfying.  I add some small pasta and it takes it to a whole new level.  Thanks for posting this.  It is my go to beef roast recipe.
305531,80536,2016-11-04,5,"This was a delicious stew that I really enjoyed. Thanks for sharing, Ev."
13483,19710,2002-07-09,5,"So simple and easy to do.  I sprayed with butter flavoured spray with a small amount of butter.  Also added some celery salt, garlic powder and paprika.  It was excellent.   Thank you Kelly"
38643,19710,2002-10-22,4,A nice change from the regular picnic fare.
68460,19710,2003-04-02,5,Sorry...I forgot to add the rating!  This was a great recipe and so nice to just stick it on the grill and turn your attention to other things.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was SO good.  Thanks so much for the recipe!
60992,19710,2003-08-02,5,What a fantastic way to make cauliflower and my kitchen didn't get all steamy! I used the followed the direction exactly except for adding some garlic powder. My husband himself ate half! This from a man who would not touch cauliflower a year ago! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe Kelly!
81611,19710,2003-10-02,5,"Absolutely incredible. I rarely eat raw cauliflower, and almost never buy it to cook, but today it was on sale and looked very fresh. Well, thanks to this recipe, my hubby AND 3yr old devoured this veggie. I loved it too. Thanks for bringing life back to this food!"
101823,19710,2004-04-30,4,"This was great.  Hubby loves cauliflower, but I am not as fond of it.  I prepared this recipe mostly for him, but do have to admit that I was very surprised with the yummy flavor.  I used unsalted butter and Lawry's seasoning salt. We served this with grilled ribeye steaks and a spinach salad.  The meal was awesome, and there were no leftovers.  I won't drag my feet anymore when hubby requests cauliflower.
"
103876,19710,2004-08-14,5,This turned out great!  I used less butter and a little less parmesan cheese and was really pleased with the results.  Easy to make too.  Thanks for a new way to serve cauliflower.
13796,19710,2004-08-15,5,"Easy to do.. and darn tasty, too. I used thyme, seasoned salt, garlic powder and a little Parmesan cheese. I didn't have any trouble with the cheese sticking. I used regular foil but didn't squeeze the foil against the cauliflower. Leave space for the veggie to steam. "
42720,19710,2004-09-22,5,"This recipe is so easy and so delicious!  Instead of seasoning salt, I just used regular salt and black pepper but then I sprinkled on some dry cilantro leaves and garlic powder along with the Parmesan.  So good and so much more flavorful than steaming or boiling.  We love to cook outdoors and thought we had tried almost every veggie cooked on the grill this way.  We just found out what we have been missing!"
173579,19710,2005-04-22,5,"Absolutely awesome is all I can say for this vegetable.   I could have eaten the whole head of cauliflour.
Can't get any easier than this.  Just through it on with your meat and you have a meal.  Thanks for the delicious dish.   "
93006,19710,2005-06-05,5,"Absolutely terrific...used 1/4 c. Blue Bonnet margarine (a must IMO), Tony Chachere's for the seasoning and it took right at 40 minutes on the bbq pit at about 225 degrees.  We gobbled it up - thanks for this keeper!"
29782,19710,2005-07-20,5,Amazedly delicious! Great new way for me to make Cauliflower now. So simple and good. Thanks for sharing your recipe!
278113,19710,2006-01-23,5,My children actually fight over who gets the last of these! That would make these a keeper! Thanks for sharing this recipe.
305531,19710,2006-07-12,5,"Not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said, but this was great.  We were fighting over the last pieces."
307214,19710,2006-09-29,5,"Wonderful, we all love cauliflower and we weren't dissappointed.  I used only about 2 tbsp. butter (trying to watch fat intake).  We will make this  again.  Thanks!"
358796,19710,2006-10-04,5,"This tasted very simple, but that is not a fault. It was simple good. The butter seemed like a lot (and I only used 1/4 cup) but it really did soak into the head and help get the flavors all the way through. 40 minutes was a bit long for me... the cauliflower was super soft- you could cut it with a spoon. I tend to like my veggies a little more tender-crisp, so I will probably reduce the time to 20-30 minutes next time. Good eash veggie dish to do on the grill!"
47907,19710,2007-04-29,5,"WOW!!!  we loved this recipe!  I made as posted except that I baked in the oven at 400Âº for about 50 minutes.  The flavor was great ~ in fact, didn't taste like cauliflower at all.  I saved the leftovers for tonight's dinner and I am not in the mood toshare, LOL!  Thanks for posting a keeper!"
520150,19710,2007-06-25,5,"I loved this!  I will make this again & again for myself, whenever I am grilling.  I even had leftovers to take to work & it was still wonderful.  My dh didn't like it, so I will make a separate foil for him with just butter & salt.  BORING!!  Thank you very much, I really enjoyed this."
369715,19710,2007-09-03,4,This was good but took a lot longer to cook.
140132,19710,2007-12-12,4,This is good.  I like anything different to do with cauliflower and this is a keeper.  thank you for something new.....Stephanie
126104,19710,2007-12-26,3,"This was very good.  I split the cauliflower into two batches.  One had the seasoning salt; the other had the salt, cayenne pepper and garlic powder.  It was slightly bland to my taste (with just the seasoning salt), so maybe it's just me.  I prefer a little more seasoning."
145352,19710,2008-04-29,5,Very good and easy!!!! I overcooked mine so it was a little too soft. Next time I'll take it off a little sooner!!
176615,19710,2008-06-04,5,Loved this! I can't say that it convinced the cauliflower haters in my family but that's OK. More for me! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
312577,19710,2008-08-04,5,I used a brocciflower (broccoli/cauliflower) and baked it in the oven for an hour.  It was easy and delicious.  I would use this recipe again.  I added some extra seasonings such as garlic powder.  Great recipe!
844554,19710,2008-10-17,5,"This was very tasty. I only used half a head so I put it in a casserole dish. Added thyme, seasoned salt, garlic powder and parmesan. Covered with foil. Very good. Served with Recipe #45940"
914720,19710,2009-06-21,5,"We loved this.  We probably overcooked it - it was very soft, and most of the butter and cheese stuck to the foil - but it was delicious.  Next time, I may replace the butter with olive oil, and stick some whole cloves of garlic in between the cauliflower florets.  Thanks for posting!"
229850,19710,2009-07-06,5,This was really easy and good. Made it exactly as written. But also put in oven to cook 375 for one hour.
33159,19710,2009-07-26,4,"This is quite good!  Very tender, great flavour & really nice presentation!  It was very easy to make.  My finished product ended up a funny brown colour - not sure if I cooked it too long??"
53932,19710,2009-09-06,4,"This was quite good.  Unfortunately, most of the cheese ended up stuck to the foil.  Mine seemed to take forever to cook and ended up needing to microwave it to the point of tenderness."
74281,19710,2009-09-17,5,We are low(er) carbing and so I always look for a way to fix veggies. THIS was absolutely delicious and I could have eaten the entire thing myself however I would have had to fight off the rest of the family as they all loved it too! Low Carb and really yummy is a great combination for us!
142335,19710,2010-05-19,5,"I throw everything on the grill so I c/dn't wait to try this. I wacked mine apart top with butter, adobo seasoning, garlic powder and pepper. After cooking I added the cheese and closed the foil until ready to serve...yummm.
DEE-Licious! I tried to buy more caulifower today but it looked yucky. I'll make this forever."
198154,19710,2017-04-25,4,"I made this for my family for dinner tonight. Their reviews weren't what I expected. My husband, who really likes cauliflower, just thought it was just okay. My daughter, who typically isn't a huge fan of cauliflower, loved it. And the remaining could give or take it."
40961,185446,2006-09-14,5,"I just finished eating this soup and couldn't wait to review it.I followed the recipe exactly as written except I left out the parsley. I love that it uses boneless chicken thighs.It was so easy to cut them up with two forks. No bones floating, very nice. The final result is an absolutely delicious meal. I served it with French bread and butter but will definitely try the white bread next time:). I know I will be making this all winter. Thanks for sharing the ultimate comfort food."
9869,18816,2002-03-18,5,"This is delicious!
I used garlic powder as I had run out of garlic, the sweet and sour flavour in this dish is really nice. Thanks for posting Lennie.  =)"
38643,18816,2002-08-17,3,Maybe my cabbage was too big but we didn't think this dish had a whole lot of flavor. Will try again but double the brown sugar and vinegar.
136997,18816,2005-04-11,5,"This was very tasty. I used the curly cabbage, because I like the tecture better and I also used balsamic vinegar. Someday when there are no more picky eaters in the house I would like to add the onions as most reviewers have. "
37449,18816,2004-09-06,5,"This was delicious! I halved the cabbage, using the full amount of the other ingredients. I also am looking forward to using baslamic vinegar next time. I served this with vegetarian sausage. Thanks so much for this recipe!"
42720,18816,2005-01-01,4,"This is a very good cabbage recipe and like some of the other reviewers, I added some thinly sliced onion to perk up the flavor.  I cooked this recipe a total of about 10 minutes because we like cabbage a bit crunchy.  I felt the ratio of brown sugar and red wine vinegar were perfect.  Just enough to flavor but not so much it made the cabbage soupy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe."
176615,18816,2005-03-19,5,"Great! A bit of carmelization goes a long way in making cabbage tasty, so much better than its limp steamed counterpart. Made exactly as directed, it suited my meal perfectly. I enjoyed it very much, even the leftovers. I'll try adding onion, that sounds yummy too! Thanks, Lennie!"
145352,18816,2005-03-20,5,"This was easy and delicious! I only made a small batch, cuz I had just a bit of cabbage left that wouldn't fit in the pot with my corned beef. Oh, I wish I had had a whole head of cabbage. Very good!!"
64642,18816,2005-03-28,3,"A very pleasant, easy to make cabbage side dish."
142367,18816,2005-03-28,2,"It must be something I did, but this recipe was not a hit at my house.  It turned out really bland, so maybe I should have upped the spices.  My cabbage eating children didn't care for it."
92886,18816,2005-06-28,4,Nice option for preparing cabbage.  Adding onions sound like a good idea too.
49304,18816,2005-07-30,5,"We love cabbage, this is a great recipe. We loved the flavor of the sweetness of the brown sugar and the tartness of the vinegar. I used balsamic vingar-YUM, as I discovered that I was out of red wine vinegar. I am going to make this using some onions in it the next time, there will  be a next time SOON. Thank you, Lennie for posting this yummy recipe."
188119,18816,2005-10-26,5,"This was pretty good! I served it with a steak and surprisingly most people liked this over the steak.. hrm
I will be making this again, probably due to request from my family.
Thanks!"
53932,18816,2005-12-04,5,I like cabbage and I loved this.  I made the recipe just as written and think the only way it could be improved upon is to add some onions and brown them as others have suggested.
95743,18816,2006-01-23,5,Can't add much to others' comments.  We both enjoyed this. I changed the butter to olive oil and the sugar to honey but I don't think the cabbage suffered any for the alterations.
104295,18816,2006-02-13,4,"We enjoyed this.  I used red cabbage and balsamic vinegar and 3/4 of us enjoyed it (the pickiest child's vote rarely counts though!).  I think I would have liked a little more flavor, so next time I'll use more vinegar.  Thanks!"
173579,18816,2006-10-08,3,I liked this ok but my DH wasn't as fond of it.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
137911,18816,2006-11-07,5,"Awesome way to serve cabbage.  So easy, healthy and delicous.  Even my 10 yo daughter liked it.  It went perfect with the chicken I served: <a href=""/27126"">Grilled Chicken Yakitori</a>.  "
125640,18816,2007-01-03,3,"Easy to make and nice as something different. I followed the recipe exactly (using butter and the larger amount of garlic). It was pretty well balanced (not too sweet, not too vinegary). However my cabbage hater wasn't impressed at all and it only ranged from okay to good from the cabbage lovers around here. I might make this again, but I'm not sure."
140132,18816,2007-01-17,5,"Very good.  I had already liked cabbage, but this gave it a wonderful flavor.  I really liked the vinegar with the cabbage. We will definately be making this again.  Thank you for a great recipe.....Stephanie"
126104,18816,2007-01-27,2,"I love garlic, red wine vinegar, brown sugar.  They just didn't work for me with the cabbage.  Maybe without the garlic, I would have liked it better.  Sorry."
362983,18816,2007-03-14,4,"I love this dish for how simple it was to prepare. I used less cabbage but it still needed more red wine vinegar because it was a bit bland otherwise, but with the extra vinegar, it was really nice. Next time I'll take the advice of others and sautee some onions along with the cabbage. Thanks!"
250031,18816,2007-04-07,4,"Tasty way of preparing cabbage. I happen to *like* cabbage so I don't need a special recipe. I still like it fried in butter with onions better but this was certainly good too. It needed a decent amount of salt & freshly ground pepper, too."
60260,18816,2007-05-10,4,"I had some cabbage and cole slaw mix to use up and this recipe fit the bill.  With the advice of others I sauted some onions before starting the cabbage and loved that added flavor.  All the family ate it with no complaints and a ""you can make this again"". Thanks!"
386849,18816,2008-01-15,4,"Well, Lennie, I really enjoyed this enough for 5 stars, but I love cabbage. My husband said it was ""okay"", but he hates cabbage. So, I arrived at 4 stars. Because I know he doesnt like cabbage, I decided to half the recipe, and I used a bag of the pre-shredded coleslaw. This worked out really well- he ate a little bit and I ate the rest and wanted more after that. I will definitely be making again- I could eat a half-batch by myself. Thank You!!"
185285,18816,2008-02-13,5,"Great! I actually do like cabbage, and this was a great variation.  Very easy to put together.  Be careful to take the time to keep your heat modest and stir your cabbage so it does not over-brown in spots."
358796,18816,2008-03-09,5,"Made this, cutting the cooking time in half (I like cabbage tender-crisp). Very mild flavor, somewhat flat tasting before adding salt & pepper. Overall really good slightly crunchy texture with a mellow flavor. Cabbage haters would probably love how it does not taste like traditional stinky cabbage."
32058,18816,2008-09-11,5,"OK, I LOVE cabbage, bt the family does not. DS would not try it, but DH went back for seconds. You have no idea how huge this is! I did not ""shred"" the cabbage. I diced into 1/2"" cubes. LOVE THIS RECIPE and so glad I can add another vegetable to our dinner table. I added an extra T of red wine vinegar."
969481,18816,2008-12-20,4,I am always looking for green vegies to serve at home. This is a good basic recipe. I added carlemized onions and crumbled bacon.
540346,18816,2009-04-09,5,"This recipe was very tasty and easy.  I have tried several cabbage recipes with mediocre results, but this one was a keeper.  My husband and I both went back for seconds.  I made it as listed except at the end added one link of cut-up bratwurst.  Super yummy!"
4470,18816,2009-12-03,5,"5 star all the way! - This recipe is so simple and the end result is so good . I got everthing ready i in the morning so it only took me minutes to prepare, I only cooked the cabbage for about 8 minutes (I like it crunchy) added the vinegar after 4 minutes.Instructions are clear and easy to follow . Thank you Lennie for a great recipe. P.S. there is a bit left over and that will be going into my ""clean the Fridge: fried rice - Can't wait
Added note:   I made this again last night for about the 6th time! with a difference  I chopped up a large onion and sauted it it the butter/oil until it was really golden brown then followed the recipe except I used Balsamic vinegar - either way the original recipe or last nights variation this is an excellent veggie dish Thanks again Lennie"
489552,18816,2009-12-09,5,"I saw this recipe posted over at the photo forum when Bergy made it, as soon as I saw it I was like ""looks so good"".  I love cabbage so this was going to be a bonus for me.  Well made an oh my goodness!  Loved it!  I served this on the side with some boneless pork chops topped with mushrooms n some plain baked potatoes for a great healthy meal.  I will make this again, thank you for posting."
55729,18816,2010-01-11,2,Too sweet. I served this with Recipe #28549.
1179225,18816,2013-09-28,5,"Love cabbage and loved this recipe! Thanks for posting the recipe, I&#039;ll be using it often."
1365025,18816,2013-11-29,4,This was pretty good. Sweet but not too sweet. The red wine vinegar gave it that special touch. I did add onions as one viewer suggest. Glad I did it was very good with them. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup.
280271,18816,2013-12-01,5,Hubby and I both love cabbage...this sure didn&#039;t disappoint us...I did like others and added in sliced onion...yummy...there&#039;s nothing not to like about this dish...=)
101034,56103,2004-03-15,5,These were some mighty fine tasting brussel sprouts. I added some fresh lemon juice and black pepper and I can't say enough about how delicious these were. Thanks for a great recipe Sharon.
13483,56103,2003-04-07,5,I keep looking for new ways to prepare old vegetables.  This was so simple and so good.  Just the way I like recipes. . . . good and simple.  Thanks Sharon123
26512,56103,2003-04-10,5,"These brussel sprouts are delicious, the best I've ever had. I did add a touch of garlic and a splash of balsamic vinegar for a little tang. Thanks for posting!"
60260,56103,2003-04-29,5,I'm branching out on veggies in my family and this was the 1st time I've ever made brussel sprouts.  They were very good and easy to make this way.
88099,56103,2003-07-12,2,This was an okay dish but highly over rated.  I don't think it is a 5star recipe.
52543,56103,2003-10-27,5,"An easy recipe with excellent taste! Since I'm not a big salt user, I was surprised to find that I too added more salt. The only recommendation that I would make to other chefs is to cut any larger sprouts in half or they will be too crunchy. Thanx Sharon! "
101823,56103,2003-11-16,5,"Hubby and I had these tonight as a side with roasted chicken. Hubby had no complaints, as brussel sprouts are one of his favorite vegetables.  I ate more brussel sprouts than chicken!  The roasting process really brings out a delicious flavor.  I don't usually use much salt, but added a good pinch of coarse kosher salt prior to roasting and a little more after.  I will definatly make these again."
4470,56103,2003-12-18,5,  I have forced myself and taught myself to like veggies and I eat at least two fresh ones every day but with this recipe I LOVE Brussels Sproats!   It truly gives a different dimension to sprouts. Thank You Laura Lee and my iron seeking body thanks you too
35526,56103,2004-03-25,4,These were easy to prepare and tasty.  I think my brussel sprouts may have been a little large as they never really got creamy inside.
68960,56103,2004-06-16,5,Excellent.  Love the way the brussel sprouts crisp up and have such a creamy centre.  An amazing recipe and one that I will use often.  Thanks.
76951,56103,2004-06-20,5,Exceptionally good!
29014,56103,2004-11-04,5,"This is the best way EVER to make Brussels Sprouts!!  I made the recipe exactly as posted and I loved the way some of the outer leaves fell off and got all brown and crackly - yum!  Even picky meat-n-potatoes DH loved these - thanks, Sharon!!"
176615,56103,2004-12-04,5,"Amazingly simple and wonderful! The recipe as stated is quite good, also the suggestions in the other reviews for a drizzle of balsamic vinegar or parmesan are super, even plain with olive oil and kosher salt is quite tasty. I've made them with fresh and frozen brussel sprouts with good results. "
95743,56103,2005-02-20,5,This may be my new favorite way to prepare Brussels sprouts.  I cut them in half and they roasted in about 20 minutes.  So easy and simple.  Terrific taste.
121185,56103,2005-03-21,4,"These were pretty darn yummy!  I followed the recipe to a ""t"" and they came out very crisp on the outside and perfect on the inside.  I wasn't sure I LOVED these at 1st - but after picking on them for about an hour, wouldn't you know - the whole pan was empty!  "
7108,56103,2005-06-23,5,"Very good!  I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 tsp sea salt (didn't have Kosher salt) though next time I may scale it down to 1/4 tsp sea salt, used ground pepper and added 1 clove crushed garlic to step #3.  Next time I may even try a splash of balsamic vinagrette or lemon juice as some reviews had suggested.  I also agree with another reviewer:  creamy on the outside and crispy on the outside.....yes, that's just what they were like!  I actually preferred them better not freshly baked and hot from the oven but after they sat for a bit and were just warm. "
132764,56103,2005-11-06,5,I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe! I've made it several times now and the whole family loves it (even the sprout haters). It's often requested for special occasions. There is a fine line between roasted and burnt though. Don't get too carried away with the cooking time. Let your nose and your eyes be your guide. ;)
158086,56103,2006-01-11,5,Fabulous way to make brussel sprouts....smells up the house but well worth it....
58836,56103,2006-07-03,0,"Made these a couple days ago and used frozen sprouts so I'm not going to rate.  They were ok, I'm sure fresh is better.  I'll try again.   "
262312,56103,2006-10-22,4,"These are so yummy!  I've made these twice already.  I wish I could say that DH liked them, but he'll never like brussell sprouts!  I did omit the lemon-pepper seasoning and used real lemon juice instead.  These are so crunchy and delish!"
59473,56103,2006-11-05,5,These sprouts were absolutely delicious. I didn't have any lemon pepper seasoning so I just used kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. They were quite brown on the outside after the specified cooking time but still nice and tender and juicy on the inside. Maybe next time I will see what they are like after a shorter cooking time. Thanks for a great recipe.
280271,56103,2006-11-12,5,"Great new way to cook brussel sprouts. Quick and easy. I will be making this again. Really liked the flavor and ease of preperation. Mine also came out on the dark side. Next time may try cooking on a lower temp. and less time. Thanks, Sharon123 for posting this tasty dish."
362983,56103,2006-12-05,5,This was so simple yet SO satisfying! I don't think I've even had brussels sprouts before and I just fell in love with these! I used a pepper mix we had and it was just delicious and the timing was perfect. I could eat these every day!
53932,56103,2007-01-12,5,I agree with everyone else.  These are excellent.
347822,56103,2007-01-16,4,My guests loved this recipe. Thanks for the posting.
89831,56103,2007-02-02,5,"So so so good! I have made these before but this is a first using lemon-pepper seasoning, will be making again, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten:0"
394077,56103,2007-02-08,4,Very easy and a great way to eat brussel sprouts.  Be sure to use lemon pepper because they make a huge difference in taste.  Thank you for the recipe. My sprouts were smaller so it only took 20 minutes for them to be tender.
27643,56103,2007-02-18,5,"Absolutely the best sprouts EVER!! Amazing flavor, this is definitely going to be a fave in this house. Thanks so much for the recipe, Sharon."
199792,56103,2007-03-14,5,"This is so yummy! I will also let you in on a secret. I used frozen sprouts as that is all I had in the house and they worked just fine. Perhaps a little tough on the ends but so, so good. You cannot go wrong with a recipe from Ina. This will be on our table again. Thanks for posting this recipe."
358796,56103,2007-05-25,5,"Awesome! Crispy, crunchy outside, smooth creamy inside. We did not have lemon pepper, so I used regular pepper and Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute and it was terrific. Any season blend would be good here. Next time we'll try Greek seasoning. This is just such a simple, easy method that produces yummy sprouts. Thanks for sharing!!"
125640,56103,2007-07-11,5,"So simple, yet so tasty. My local store didn't have fresh brussel sprouts this time, so I tried frozen and turned the heat down to 350F for the last 20 minutes; worked just fine. Will definately make this often. Thanks for sharing."
185285,56103,2007-08-28,5,"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!  I baked mine at 350F on the convection-bake setting and these took 30 minutes. DH and I both loved them, thans!"
32058,56103,2007-12-24,5,Would make again and again.  My DH who does NOT eat Brussel sprouts ate these and LIKED them.  I cheated and used frozen then thawed (2 # bag)  and they were great.  Can only imagine how wonderful they would be with fresh...
184723,56103,2007-09-05,5,These were just YUMMY!  My family looked at them and wouldn't touch them but I have a picky husband and young children... but that left more for me!  I will definitely be making these again - finally found a way I like brussels sprouts!!!!!  THANKS!
400420,56103,2007-11-07,5,Love these!  I already love brussels sprouts and roasting just makes them better!!  Thank you so much!
37779,56103,2007-12-13,5,"Excellent method for cooking brussels sprouts.  Crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside. Deliciously seasoned, too. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
377581,56103,2007-12-16,5,"Quick, easy and very tasty! I used thawed frozen sprouts and they worked really well! Absolutely perfect. Thank you."
207176,56103,2008-01-22,5,All my Brussels sprouts eaters LOVED these and they were so easy to make. Couldn't find my lemon-pepper so used garlic-pepper! Made them for Thanksgiving and my SIL asked if she could take some home with her!
439797,56103,2008-03-04,5,I had never made brussels sprouts before.  These were terrific.
499050,56103,2008-06-07,5,Yum.
373817,56103,2008-08-08,5,"These are so good!! I love how crispy they are on the outside, but tender on the inside. My 4 year old will even eat these!!!"
226863,56103,2008-12-03,5,"Delicious!  I was a little scared when I saw how dark the brussel sprouts were getting, but they tasted great!  I loved them.  Thanks so much for posting a recipe I'll make again and again!  Made for Everyday is a Holiday Tag!"
350750,56103,2009-01-22,5,This was delicious! I used frozen brussel sprouts.  My husband loved these.  They are so easy.  I'm keeping this recipe close. Thanks!
844554,56103,2009-06-20,5,"This was very, very tasty. I normally put chili powder on these but I followed your recipe and put lemon pepper seasoning. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe."
133174,56103,2010-01-17,5,I can well understand why these have so many wonderful reviews.  The perfect way to prepare fresh sprouts.  Thanks Sharon for a wonderful new side.
195589,56103,2010-05-27,5,"We really enjoyed these! I didn't have the lemon-pepper so I used some Montreal seasoning instead. I also put some fresh Parm on after I cooked it. You know, my entire life I thot they were called Brussel Sprouts, NOT Brussels  Sprouts...hmmm, maybe I better google that to find out for sure. LOL Great recipe, thanks for posting Sharon. Made for ZWT6."
470351,56103,2010-07-01,5,"Oh Yum!  I, too, used montreal seasoning rather than lemon pepper seasoning.  Convected this for 20 minutes at 400!  PERFECTION!"
369715,56103,2010-10-15,4,Good and easy to make. Followed the recipe as written using pepper and not the lemon pepper as that is all I had.
64642,56103,2012-04-25,3,"Quite easy to put together and easy to make.  I had really hoped after reading all the great reviews that we would love these, too.  Roasting resulted in an okay result for us but we won't be making it again.  We weren't wild about the texture of the cooked sprouts and the aroma from the oven permeated the whole house."
540346,56103,2013-07-28,4,"This was my first time to ever eat brussels sprouts.  They were good and my kids ate them.  A friend came over and she said she has never liked brussels sprouts before but she really liked this recipe.  I did use coconut oil in place of olive oil, salt, and black pepper.  I will try them again."
13796,56103,2013-10-03,5,These are fabulous! My sister pays top dollar for these at the gourmet grocery and she shares with me. I can&#039;t wait to share these with her! I better head out for more sprouts. These are terrific. Like other reviewers I added garlic cloves to the mix and they softened beautifully. I also added 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder to the salt and oil. I omitted the lemon pepper. 30 minutes in my convection oven at 400 was perfect. I wish I had made more. I could eat these the way some people eat candy.
928301,56103,2013-10-08,4,Quite good.  I wouldn&#039;t cook em for 40 minutes though.  30 was plenty for me.
68460,56103,2013-11-02,5,The Best brussels sprouts ever.  I sliced each sprout in half to increase the crispy edginess and just used plenty of salt and pepper.  It&#039;s amazing that my husband loved them...and he wouldn&#039;t even LOOK at a sprout in the past.  These are so good that I plan on adding brussels sprouts to my garden next year.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe Sharon :)
482376,56103,2014-02-06,5,Delish! Super easy and very flavorful. I just love roasted Brussels sprouts and this recipe was a winner. Thank you!
128473,56103,2014-02-10,5,"Wow, wow, wow Sharon.  I am not a huge fan of Brussel sprouts, but I may be now.  These little sprouts were oh so lovely, soft, tender, slightly sweet with a nice dark outer skin that had a great bite.   Made exactly as written wouldn&#039;t change a thing. They were so quick and easy to make, I know that we will be enjoying these again.  Made for the Best of 2013, Kudos to you for making it into my Best of Cookbook for 2014."
98919,56103,2014-03-11,5,I can&#039;t believe I forgot to rate these! Add another 5 stars from my family. A keeper for sure!
1179225,56103,2014-11-23,3,"This recipe didn&#039;t work out too well for me. The brussels turned out dry on the outside and mushy inside. I think they should have come out 10 or 15 mins. sooner, but then they may have lost the roasted flavor. These just weren&#039;t for us. Thanks for posting the recipe. It&#039;s always fun trying new things."
265954,56103,2014-12-14,4,"Easy and savory way to make Brussels sprouts. Makes the kitchen smell great. I made half the amount and would recommend a cooler oven of 325, since the amount I roasted started burning after 15 minutes at 400. Thank you for sharing."
37636,56103,2015-01-25,5,"The first time I made these I didn&#039;t like the lemon  pepper. I made these again without recalling I had made them before and by some stroke of luck forgot the lemon pepper totally, and felt they were perfect with just salt and black pepper. So if someone doesn&#039;t like the lemon pepper, try it again without and I&#039;m sure you will love it!"
138429,81902,2004-12-19,5,"These are fantastic. I peeled the potatoes the day before,kept them in the fridge in water,cooked them the following morning mixed them and then kept them in the crock pot,and turned on the crockpot a couple of hrs. before the meal to reheat a bit. I skipped the chives and the bacon. This recipe is placed in my Tried and true cookbook. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe."
174991,81902,2005-11-29,5,"This is a great recipe. I made them Thaksgivings eve and refrigerated them.  A couple of hours before dinner, I put the crockpot on low, added some milk and butter.  I stirred a couple of times before we ate and they were great."
222564,81902,2006-01-12,5,"Ooooh, wow! Sour Cream &Onion flavored mash! I say YESSS, we loved them! I did not put the mash in oven, but prepared just before meal. "
158086,81902,2006-03-19,5,These are wonderful mashed potatoes...I made these with my Parmesean Pork Tenderloin recipe that I will have to take the time to put on recipezaar..thanks for a wonderful potato side dish recipe.
80998,81902,2006-11-24,5,These were really good!  They were a perfect dish for our Thanksgiving.
400708,81902,2006-12-31,3,"This was wonderful when fresh made, but we tried to do the ""make ahead"" part and when reheated it came out dry and hard.  Don't know if I did something wrong in the reheating - which is possible; but next time would make it just before serving and we'll enjoy it much more."
188119,81902,2007-01-07,5,This was good and tasted like eating a sour cream and chives baked potato.  Thanks!
8688,81902,2007-03-06,5,"Very easy to prepare with wonderful results!  I halved the recipe and omitted the garlic (personal preference).  I will remember to use this recipe for make ahead dishes when having company!  Thank you, Helping Hands : )"
195589,81902,2007-11-11,5,"Took these to a company Christmas potluck. (last year, sorry I didn't review sooner.)Everyone LOVED them. I left out the bacon and served them from the crockpot which I left on warm setting and they were perfect!Since then I have used Boursin soft cheese in place of the cream cheese and just as yummy that way. Thanks for a keeper..."
312577,81902,2007-11-23,5,"I made these for Thanksgiving and was giving the great compliment of ""these are the best mashed potatoes I have ever had"".  AMAZING.  I loved the fact that I could make them the night before, then just put them in the crockpot on Thanksgiving day.  I only have a single stove and this was a great way to use what I had in the kitchen.  BEST MASHED POTATOES IN THE WORLD!!"
8629,81902,2007-11-25,3,These potatoes tasted very good.  The slow cooker did a nice job of keeping the potatoes hot but it seemed to me that they also dried out a little too much.  Next time I will add more milk to the mixture. I used a ricer to mash the potatoes.
240552,81902,2007-12-26,5,"Awesome potatoes and freed up our oven for the prime rib!!  I did 1/2 c of green onion as mine were quite strong.  I also crumbled 5 pieces of bacon in with the potatoes and made recipe #60795 for the chive and onion cream cheese.  Wonderful!!  Thanks, Helping Hands!!"
140132,81902,2008-01-01,5,Very convenient for that busy day. Thank you for a great idea and recipe....Stephanie
55578,81902,2008-01-02,5,What a great make ahead recipe!  No more Extra work on busy holidays making potatoes.  I can do them a day ahead.  Tx for the recipe!
269331,81902,2008-03-28,5,"OMG, these are some good mashed potatoes!  I made these the day before, refrigerated them overnight, threw them in the crockpot the next day about for about three hours before dinner (did add a little more milk towards the end) and they were perfect!  I did omit the marjoram and bacon.  Iâ€™ll never make any other mash potato recipe!"
357358,81902,2008-06-08,5,"""To Die For"" is so true. All six of us really enjoyed these potatoes. I did not have time for the crockpot method, so these went in the oven. I used real bacon pieces and omitted the marjoram. Well worth the effort. Thanks!"
485151,81902,2008-09-10,4,"These were delicious mashed taters I really liked them. This is what I did when I made them:
I doubled the recipe and used 1 chive & onion cream cheese & 1 reg cream cheese (it's what I had.) I didn't add chives (forgot to buy them.) And I accidentally put in garlic powder in addition to onion powder, so I did not add the garlic cloves. I didn't add the sliced green onion either because I forgot. Despite all these changes- it tasted great. Half went into the crockpot and was ate with dinner. I put the other half into a bag in the freezer for easy taters another meal."
368078,81902,2008-12-23,5,"I can't believe anyone would give this less than 5 stars.  As far as we're concerned, it deserves 10 stars!!  This recipe is fantastic - we make just as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks, Helping Hands, for such a wonderful recipe!!"
142367,81902,2009-01-19,4,"These are good and I loved the make ahead and serve in the crockpot idea, however I think I am still looking for my perfect make ahead mashed 'taters recipe. I think I prefer a more buttery type of mashed potato. If you do decide to use your crockpot make sure you are familiar with how long it will take to heat them through.  I made mine on the stove, stuck them in the crockpot overnight and reheated them on Turkey Day.  They were not warm all the way through -- not a good thing to discover when you sit down to eat."
185446,81902,2009-01-29,5,I have a similar recipe but hate to admit these taste better.  I love the garlicky overtones and creamy consistency.  The added bacon is a very pretty and tasty topping.  The only change I made was to replace both the salt/onion powder with just a bit of onion salt.  Thanks for sharing this time-saving crockpot recipe.
315055,81902,2010-01-13,5,"These were some of the best I've ever had!  I omitted the extra chives, green onions, and bacon bits, and they were sooo good.  My hub isn't a huge garlic fan so next time I may halve the garlic, but I love garlic and thought it was just right!
Update: I made it with the chives and it was excellent!  I would halve the green onions, though, if using the chives."
177933,81902,2010-11-23,5,Easy and wonderful recipe! I am making them again for Thanksgiving this week! Thanks!
173579,81902,2011-05-11,5,These were great mash potatoes.  The green onion really gave a special touch.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
383346,81902,2013-06-27,5,These are really good.  So easy to do in advance and then when ready just heat in the oven.  I made half the recipe for the 3 of us and we had leftovers.  Thanks Helping Hands :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game
203111,81902,2013-08-03,5,"Just made these for the second time for a family get-together after receiving a phone call asking me to bring &quot;those awesome potatoes&quot;.   The first time making them, someone had only supplied me with the list of ingredients, so I just mixed everything up in a bowl and stored them in the refrig till ready to serve.  Then we just nuked them till hot and served.  They were wonderful!  &lt;br/&gt;So then then next time I made them, I followed the full instructions of baking them for 25 minutes before serving.  To be honest, I&#039;m not sure there was any difference between the baked ones and the nuked ones.  Regardless, they are so tasty, we completely cleaned the baking dish in one sitting.  I did think the onion taste was stronger than needed, so I&#039;ll only use the 1/2 cup green onions next time instead of the full 1 cup.  And I used plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and we couldn&#039;t really tell any difference.  Thanks for sharing this keeper!!!"
1179225,81902,2014-12-25,4,"These are really tasty. But, I have to say a little too rich for us. We thought it was almost like a potato cheesecake. Both DH and I want to make them again but use about 1/4 of the cream cheese and add some milk. Loved the other mix-ins and the ease of the recipe. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
198154,81902,2015-03-08,5,"I didn&#039;t add any milk and they were a little thinner than we usually like our mashed potatoes.  But the flavor made up for it!  We used light sour cream and reduced fat cream cheese and it didn&#039;t take away from it at all.  I had green onions to use up so I am sure I had close to a cup, next time I will stick with have a cup as it was almost too much. I say almost because no one else mentioned it as they gobbled up second (or third!!) helpings!"
1581225,27210,2017-08-11,5,"I'm not a fan of pork, but my family loved these and want me to make them again."
184723,97496,2006-07-18,5,Super good.  I think this is the first cookie where my husband and little boy ate up every single one of them... even with a box of Chips Ahoy in the cupboard.  Thanks!
146047,97496,2005-04-23,5,"Juju Bee, these cookies are delicious! I haven't had snickerdoodles in many years and for some reason this caught my eye. I'm glad it did. I used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c unsalted butter, and for the flour I used 2 c whole wheat pastry and 3/4 c oat flours. Using a half-ounce cookie scoop, my yield was 53 2-inch cookies, which took 9 minutes to bake because of their smaller size. My 8 y.o. son loves them and had fun helping me roll the dough in the cinnamon sugar. Thanks for posting this recipe."
180090,97496,2005-05-12,5,"I needed to bring cookies to a potluck at work, but didn't have any yummy ingredients at home, but this cookie did the trick! Had all the ingredients on hand and everyone raved about them. Very soft and chewy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe JuJu Bee! I need to make some for home now!"
222564,97496,2006-07-20,4,"Goody, goody! I made crispy cookies by flattening the dough balls flat with a fork and baking few extra minutes. They crack in oven and that makes nice cinnamon stripes on top. Must try them as soft balls, next time. "
187281,97496,2005-12-16,5,"Yes, these are soft and delicious.  However, I must be snickerdoodle impaired b/c it took me until the very last bit of dough to figure this recipe out.  The cookies MUST be measured into heaping teaspoon or tablespoons (depending on preference) to turn out.  My first few rounds of dough turned out still doughy in the middle.  But, once I reduced the size of the cookies they were excellent.  They even cracked on the top.  So, don't make the same mistake I did.  Make the cookies small!  I also had to adjust the temp to 360 degrees for my tempermental oven.  These cookies are incredibly soft and the dough is amazing once I figured it out! Thanks!"
185446,97496,2006-04-23,5,"My husband couldn't keep his hands off these.  Not exactly a dieter's dream, but if you're looking for a good cookie recipe, who cares?"
248023,97496,2007-08-16,5,Yum!!!  I was craving something with just a little sweetness to it... these cookies were great.  Made them just as instructed except I did not chill the cookie sheet first.  I suppose that is to ensure the cookie from spreading too far?  I scooped out the dough with a TBS and placed them about 2 inches apart.  They took about 11 minutes for a beautiful golden brown. Just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar... A great alternative when you're craving a cookie but don't want a classic chocolate chip!
316717,97496,2007-12-31,5,"my kids went crazy over these. huge hit. great taste, and yes soft. my husband and i loves it too. followed everything except i didn't chill the dough. i used a cookie scooper and dropped the balls gently into the cinnamon and sugar mixture and that worked great. baked it right away. will definately go into my favorites."
294000,97496,2008-01-06,5,Wonderful!  Didn't chill the cookie sheet but followed everything else as stated.  Thanks!
394077,97496,2008-02-12,4,So easy to do and very tasty.
191533,97496,2008-02-26,5,"This is the perfect snickerdoodle. I used a 1 1/4 inch cookie scoop and got 5 dozen. It IS simple to have them come out soft if you don't make them too big, and keep the dough chilled. Instead of chilling the pans, I chilled the dough overnight and kept it in the fridge in between batches."
218535,97496,2008-02-27,4,I got 40 cookies instead of the 24 stated. This is very good. The batch that I baked on a dark pan came out perfect. Another batch baked on a Air-Bake insulated pan just NEVER sets up.
269331,97496,2008-12-29,5,"These turned out PERFECT, even without the cream of tartar (oops)!  A friend said she was a snickerdoodle aficionado and these were the best she ever hadâ€¦ what else can you say?"
315055,97496,2009-08-04,4,"These were good, but I think there was too much cinammon/sugar mixture, if I make again I will only dip the top half in the mixture."
140132,97496,2010-06-19,5,Ohhhh....cinnamony goodness.  We love snickerdoodles but I've never tried to make them.  I decieded to give it a go last night and they were delicious.  Simple to prepare and took no time at all.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.
176615,97496,2010-11-07,5,"Fabulous! These are the best Snickerdoodles. I never use shortening in cookies and loved that this recipe called for butter. The flavor was so much better than other recipes, and the texture was cookie-perfect, not too soft or too crunchy. Very pretty cookie and very popular with my kids. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
879716,97496,2010-11-30,5,Very yummy!  This is the first recipe I've tried in my new stand mixer and it was easy and pretty fast.  Used a small disher to portion out the dough.  I baked half and froze half of the cinnamon-sugar coated dough balls for easy baking later.  I'll definitely make these again!
1133190,97496,2011-01-17,0,"These were very tasty.  I felt like mine turned out a little flat, I'd be happy to try them again to see if I could get a better result though!"
285039,97496,2012-05-30,5,"Quick, easy and yummy.....thinking these will be a winner with my son's last day of school party!"
98919,97496,2013-07-25,5,Add another 5 stars for me! These are awesome!! Love the chilling of the baking sheets! My grandkids loved these! We greased the pan because they were hard to get off. Thanks for sharing!!
1052873,97496,2013-12-26,5,Very soft and tasty.
350750,97496,2014-01-10,5,Delicious cookies that are soft and easy to make.  Thank you!
1179225,97496,2014-04-07,5,"5 stars! Light, buttery, just a great recipe. Thanks for sharing this delicious keeper recipe!"
400708,97496,2014-07-25,5,"Made this at a special request.  Turned out soft, chewy and cinnamon sweetness.  Loved them and easy to make."
839492,97496,2014-12-06,4,"These turned out beautiful, prepped in the food processor. We were, however disappointed as they were missing something, lacked flavor. I feel as though they would be improved with the addition of vanilla extract. Thanks for sharing."
1581225,97496,2017-01-06,5,"Great cookies. My oven runs hot, and I left them in just a bit longer than I should so they didn't come out as soft as I would have liked but they were still good. My second batch I ruined completely because I got distracted and they burned. No timer on my stupid oven, can't wait to get a new one!"
894666,97496,2017-10-20,5,Made exactly according to recipe. Baked 12 minutes. Got exactly 36 cookies out of this. They were oh soooo delicious!!!!
22015,29544,2002-06-13,4,"This was great, but I did make one change to the recipe.  When I was putting it all together, I found that I was almost out of ketchup, but I had part of a bottle of Heinz Chili Sauce in the fridge.  So I used it instead of the ketchup.  I think that this sauce would work great with pork steaks, pork ribs or even beef ribs.  Great recipe!"
37868,29544,2002-07-10,5,"GREAT..WONDERFUL...I put the pork chops on the bottom and then I put Tomatoes,ketchup,vinegar,brown sugar,worcestershire sauce,lemon juice and bouillon cube in a bowl to mix and heated it in the microwave to disolve the cube. Then poured it over the chops and veggies. We loved this."
8629,29544,2002-07-14,4,This was good.  It had a more sweet and sour taste than I was expecting.  Next time I will cook it longer than the specified time.  I liked the idea of the cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end.  Most slow cooker juices are very thin but this cornstarch helped to thicken the juices.
4470,29544,2002-07-17,5,"Had company for dinner - hot, muggy day so crockpot it is! Well this recipe went over in a big way. The scent from it while cooking is heavenly and lets people know they are in for a treat. I served it with new tiny potatoes and the sauce over them was great Thanks Kari for an easy hot day, any day tasty meal
 UPDATE: When I made these chops I had some sauce left over which I froze. Well last night I just browned 2 skinless chicken breasts, poured this sauce over them simmered until cooked and served the breasts with the sauce poured over plain noodles - another great meal from the same great recipe"
8688,29544,2002-07-23,5,"Well Kari, we POPPED!  These pork chops are so incredibly moist and tender you will need no fork! They reminded me of a sweet and sour flavor of a dish I have made many times before.  I followed the directions to the letter and served over rice.  The sauce this recipe makes is heavenly. An irresistible dish I will undoubtedly make again and again!  Thanks, Kari!"
13483,29544,2002-07-24,4,"This was good and well liked by my guests.  I did chop the veggies quite finely but the onions were still a bit too ""crunchy"" for me.  But the thickened sauce was good over the rice.  Thank you Kari."
44383,29544,2002-07-25,5,Yum!!  These were great! Served this for entire family and everybody loved them.  Will be doing this one again and again.
28649,29544,2002-07-29,5,"This was great!!!  I made this today for dinner and was perfect, I didn't have to heat my kitchen up.  The taste was fantastic!!  Thanks for posting this recipe."
9869,29544,2002-08-07,4,"Thanks for a tasty dish Kari.
I used pork butterfly steaks, chopped the vegetables small (they cooked fine) only used 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce (sometimes I find it overpowering) we didnt find the sauce too sweet and the result was a tasty meal that I will make again."
47559,29544,2002-09-12,4,"This was pretty good.  Next time I will brown the chops first and cook an hour on high, then low the rest of the time.  It was probably my crockpot, but the chops and vegetables needed more cooking time.  I will also cut down on the sugar.  We live in Texas and need more heat in our food (to fight the heat outside!) - thus I will try the idea of chili sauce instead of ketchup, or I also thought about Rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes.  Will make this again with modifications."
32772,29544,2003-06-23,5,I was surprised by all the one star reviews. This recipe is top of my list. I didn't find it bland at all with the stewed tomatoes and extra green pepper and onion. It was similiar to having salsa over your pork.I used boneless pork chops and cooked it for 8 hours. Did serve it over rice. My family ate every drop of it. No leftovers here.
59473,29544,2003-07-13,5,These chops were very tasty and the meat just fell off the bone. I served them with mashed potatoes. There was so much sauce left over I didn't want to waste it. I made some rice and used the leftover sauce. Will make this one again. Thanks for posting.
101034,29544,2004-04-19,5,"What a great meal this was. I used thick pork cutlets and omitted the brown sugar. It cooked about 5 hours , the meat was so tender and moist. The sauce was delicious, I served it over angel hair without thickening it. You can't get much easier than this for such a great tasting meal. Thanks Audrey"
7108,29544,2004-05-04,5,"Very easy, very good and the house smelled wonderful while this was cooking.  I didn't have beef boullion on hand, so I used a cube of ham boullion instead.  I followed the directions exactly.  Served this with rice pilaf.  Thanks Audrey!"
103876,29544,2004-05-28,5,"Well, here's one more review.  I made this today and we really liked it.  I was afraid the sauce may be too sweet, but was not disappointed at all.  I think it has a great taste and is especially good over rice.  I will definitely make this again."
142367,29544,2005-05-14,4,"These were good, but nothing to write home about. For me to give five stars, I need to have my family licking their plates off and begging for more--so you can see I'm a tough reviewer."
189616,29544,2005-11-02,5,"Prepared as directed. Delicious, and very tender, and great because it wasn't SO tender that it fell apart while removing from crockpot. Thank you Audrey M.-"
37036,29544,2006-05-27,4,Very good chops.  The family enjoyed them and I served them over rice.
140132,29544,2006-12-15,5,This recipe reminded me of swiss steak.  We really enjoyed this.  We ate it with mashed potatoes.  I only used one onion and it was plenty for us. Great flavor and so simple to put together.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  Stephanie
394077,29544,2007-01-10,3,"I followed the recipe exactly but it was a bit bland.  So, I took them out of the crockpot and added 2 apples/peeled/cored,  1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspon of nutmeg.  2 more Tablespoon of brown sugar. The recipe tastes great afterward.  Thank you for the foundation of the sauce ."
400708,29544,2007-01-25,5,"WONDERFUL; it was differant from the pork chop recipes I usually use, much better and flavorful.  Kind of reminds me of Salisbury Steak but better.  Pork was very moist and tender and the best part was how it cooks without me being there to watch it.  I really liked the idea of using the corn starch to thicken at the end & had lots of sauce left over (only did 2 chops) and froze that to use as a gravy at a later date.  The only two changes I made was pre-browning & sauting the meat & vegies as I'd seen on other post, and instead of 1 large green pepper, used 1/2 green and 1/2 sweet red pepper. Veggies & meat where perfect when done.  Served over steamed white rice with hot dinner rolls & a bottle of our favorite red wine - YUM!   Thanks for great recipe, it's a keeper and will be used again.  Next time I'll serve hot sour dough bread with it."
33159,29544,2007-03-13,4,This recipe has great flavour & the meat turns out really tender.  The sauce was just a little too sweet for our tastes.
298447,29544,2007-09-11,3,"This meal received mixed reviews from my household.  Easy enough to prepare, just not an overall ""hit"" with my family...guess we just have different taste preferences. Thanks for posting."
142464,29544,2007-12-05,5,"Oh my gosh....this is one fantastic recipe!!!
Both DH and I really enjoyed it.  Instead of rice, we had it with new potatoes.  I've been bragging to others about your recipe and have already e-mailed it to some.  Come on people, you gotta try this one - guarantee you won't be sorry.  This one definitely got saved and I plan to make it on a regular basis.  You got yourself a real winner here, thats for sure.  Thank you for sharing it."
125640,29544,2008-01-08,3,"This is really easy and fast to prep. The flavor was okay, but nothing special. It definately needs something. I would add garlic at the very least. The meat was very tender. I used bone-in pork chops, but if I make this again I think it would be better as a stew served over the rice, so I'd use boneless pork cut into bite-size pieces. Thanks for sharing."
579298,29544,2008-10-05,4,"I'm not a huge fan of pork, onions, celery and green pepper - but decided to try this combination none-the-less - Ha! DH and I were pleasantly surprised :) I subbed (yea yea, I know) onion with powder and celery with seeds, but kept in the green pepper. I also dissolved the bullion cube in 1/4 cup hot water in advance. What a yummy dish!! Please do try it!"
147109,29544,2009-08-12,3,"I love my crockpot and will find any excuse to use it. I decided to give this a try and followed it exactly other than I did not have celery. The meat was tender, and it made a decent meal....but it was just not all that tasty. There are too many amazing crock pot recipes out there to keep this one that is just okay and not something I look forward to as leftovers."
2041603,29544,2011-10-26,4,these were pretty good. Reduced the onion and pepper because I'm still a picky eater but the overall flavor was good. Had a lot of extra stuff left over so my husband ate it with rice. Probably could have thrown a couple more pork chops in.
810787,63689,2009-09-28,4,"Tasty, but not the best I've had. I omitted the celery all together as a personal preference."
9869,63689,2003-07-14,5,"Delicious, teenage son really enjoyed these for dinner, and we all liked the barbecue flavour. I used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce that I received in a food swap. I'll be making these again, thanks for sharing."
59780,63689,2003-12-23,5,Great meal! Found out I was a little short on ground beef so I chopped up a leftover smokie to make up the difference. I used That Bobbie girl's barbque sauce recipe#59772 for the bar b que sauce and served this on  homemade buns recipe#58660. How did I ever make supper without Recipezaar? ;)
8629,63689,2003-12-28,5,"The flavors meld so well in this recipe.  I've been searching for the 'perfect' sloppy joe recipe and for my family, this is it. Try this sloppy joe recipe.  I think you'll like it, too."
103876,63689,2004-01-18,5,Very good!  I like that these have tomato sauce instead of just catsup and barbeque sauce.  I also liked the addition of the celery.
37636,63689,2004-03-08,4,"This is pretty good! It tastes less barbecuey than I thought it would with the sauce in it (I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce), but that was fine as it gave it more of a sloppy joe flavor. The one thing about this recipe is that it has too much celery in it (and I only used 2 of the 3 ribs of celery called for). The celery taste was competing with the meat flavor a bit much. I think next time I will stick to just one rib, because I do think the sauce was pretty good and would prepare this again. Thanks for posting!"
101034,63689,2004-06-01,4,"These were very good, but we thought they tasted more like BBQ beef than sloppy joes. That's not a bad thing because they had great flavor. I used half a can of tomato sauce  and half a can of red wine, that was the only change I made. I think maybe the longer you cook it the more it tastes like BBQ. After 30 minutes it was still quite wet, so I simmered it for another 10 minutes and it was perfect. It tasted great and we enjoyed it very much"
88099,63689,2004-09-08,4,"These were wonderful.  I also cut down on the celery as someone suggested, using only 1 stalk and it worked out fine.  Also added a little more barbecue sauce.  Thanks for posting."
56087,63689,2004-11-08,5,"I've been making your recipe for Sloppy Joes for a year now, and cannot believe I haven't reviewed them!!  Just today I took them to work for a potluck, the Mmmmmmmm sounds were almost rediculous.  This is such an easy recipe to prepare and the taste is fantastic, made me a sloppy joe fan and I NEVER have been.  Thanks for sharing."
173579,63689,2004-11-19,5,My family loves these.  They have wonderful flavor.
13483,63689,2004-12-04,5,What can I add.  These were good.  I used homemade BBQ sauce and added some homemade chili sauce.  Three of us left nothing behind. Thanks Hey Jude
160974,63689,2004-12-22,5,"I thought this was a very satisfying sloppy joe. I accidentally grabbed a bag of frozen sausage (instead of beef) but it was really good, and the taste was slightly better than hamburger! If you have some meat cooked/frozen you can make this in five minutes.

Roxygirl in Colo."
59473,63689,2005-01-18,5,These Sloppy Joes were great. I will never use Manwich sauce again. Like a lot of other reviewers I only used 1 stalk of celery and added chopped green pepper. I used Diana Gourmet Original barbeque sauce. Thanks for a great recipe.
132383,63689,2005-06-04,5,"Made this tonight and was very pleased with the turnout.  Neither of us are ""big"" sloppy joe eaters but we were excited about this. I did add a tablespoon of Sofrito and a dash of Adobo.  We plan to serve on top of toasted buns, open-faced.  Thanks!"
125640,63689,2006-01-22,3,"I made these as instructed and served on wheat buns with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes by Mimi Bobeck. We weren't overly amazed by any of the meal. Rather ordinary sloppy joes; they did taste just like the stuff that comes out of a can. Since DH has decided sloppy joes in general are just okay and I have no real fear of preservatives and such, I'll probably just open a can and heat and save myself the effort next time."
52125,63689,2006-03-11,5,"This is wonderful! Its different from the usual sloppy joes Im use to having, but I really enjoyed this. Thanks Hey Jude...."
177933,63689,2006-07-27,5,"These were great & in the running against our regular sloppy joes.  I used celery salt instead of celery and dried onion flakes, so I did no chopping!  They were saucier than our regular and we really liked that.  I missed the pickle relish, so next time I will add that in.  Thanks, this just might be our new favorite!"
222564,63689,2006-10-14,4,"There's no taste lacking here! Very well flavored dish, that we had with home made Tasty Buns, Oven Chips, Coleslaw and some sliced tomato and it was all a treat."
47907,63689,2006-11-20,5,"Great recipe, Hey Jude!  I love the flavor of the BBQ sauce in it.  I made as posted and it was very easy.  Thanks for posting!!"
74652,63689,2006-12-17,4,These were very good!  I left the celery out because I don't like it cooked but otherwise wouldn't change a thing!
26512,63689,2006-12-18,5,"Very good, the best recipe I have tried. They were not super sweet as I used Stubb's BBQ and we really liked that. I cut the celery to one stalk. Will definitely make these again, thanks for posting."
229850,63689,2006-12-28,5,"I usually make these from a dry mix or if in a hurry just put some Sweet Baby Rays over the ground beef, this will be the only way I make sloppy joes from now on. My family loved them. Thanx for posting a great and easy recipe."
145352,63689,2007-02-23,5,"Delicious and easy!!! I doubled it, but I probably didn't need to, cuz I had tons of leftovers."
236170,63689,2007-03-20,5,Amazing! This reminds me of my mom's sloppy joes. Easy to make and absolutely delicious. We like to eat the leftovers as a dip for potato chips.
240552,63689,2007-04-23,5,"This is awesome!  I didn't put celery in it and didn't have enough bbq sauce so I just made up for it with ketchup. I added a little more sugar, too.  Thank you!!"
8688,63689,2007-04-24,5,"It's no wonder this recipe has so many excellent reviews! I am sorry it took so long for me to try it!  This recipe is so easy to make with ingredients that most everyone has on hand at all times. I made this using Jack Daniels Honey Smokehouse Barbecue Sauce and I followed your excellent directions exactly.  My husband had 3 so I know, I will be making this a lot! This is a great recipe, Hey Jude!!  My husband and I thank you : )"
64583,63689,2007-05-08,5,These are outstanding!  I wish I would've found this recipe years ago.  My family really enjoyed them.  We used Masterpiece BBQ sauce and 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef instead of just 1 lb. and simmered them for about 45 minutes.  We like our sloppy joes thicker and 1 pound just doesn't feed my family of 5.  I served them with hash browns and fruit salad.  These would be perfect served with corn on the cob also.  Thanks for posting this great recipe.  I will use it over and over.
13796,63689,2007-06-03,5,"I served these at 'game night'. I doubled the recipe and added one chopped green pepper. Everyone loved them. They were a little too sloppy at first, so I kept them in a crock pot with no lid so the mixture would thicken. Mmmm..  Thanks."
182624,63689,2007-06-19,4,"Loved these sloppy joes!  I made them for an impromptu bbq when my cousin and her family dropped in for a visit.  I hadn't eaten sloppy joes since I was a kid, but thought it sounded good for a nice lunch with all the kids running around.  DH said he loved the tang.  Thanks for sharing!"
489552,63689,2007-06-20,5,"I have never made Sloppy Joe's from scratch.  But today I decided to make it, because I had all the ingredients :)
I am so happy I did.  My kids loved it.
Thank you for a great recipe I sure will be making it again!"
329638,63689,2007-07-08,5,"This is excellent- even DH, the sloppy joe hater, went back for seconds!  I halved the recipe, ommitted the tomato sauce and celery(didn't have any on hand), used ground turkey and added some chopped bell pepper to the onion and turkey when browning.  Tangy, sweet, yummy!  Will be adding it to our meal rotation.  Thanks for posting!"
230557,63689,2007-07-22,5,"I doubled this and my boys wanted to eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner - never in their lives have they ever acted like that about any food other than candy ;)  I left out the celery."
169969,63689,2007-09-12,5,Quick and Easy. Our 5 year old loves these in his lunch box the next day! Thanks for posting.
231054,63689,2007-10-17,5,"This recipe is very similar to the one I have -- but with all the high ratings, I wanted to give this a try.  I'm so glad I did.  I love the addition of the barbecue sauce.  I did remove the cover and cook a few minutes longer to thicken up the sauce a bit.  It cooked down quickly and was very rich tasting.  I did add 1/4 t. nutmeg -- it's something I have always done with my original recipe.  I would encourage others to try the same thing.  Thank you, Hey Jude -- this is a great Sloppy Joe!"
400420,63689,2007-11-04,5,"I've made this twice now and it is great! I used 2 large stalks of celery and next time, I think I'll cut back - it was just a little too chunky. Other than that, it was really good. Thank you!"
316717,63689,2007-12-12,5,"after reading the reviews first, i decided to use only 1 celery stalk, used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and followed everything else exactly as directed. it was a huge hit w/ the family. even i, who isn't a fan of sloppy joes thought this was the best i've tried. my picky son who never finishes his food finished everything. this was so easy to make too! this will definately go into our favorites. thank you for sharing!"
176615,63689,2007-12-25,5,Delicious! The first sloppy joes my kids have ever gobbled down. My pickiest child ate two! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!
140132,63689,2008-01-19,5,Very good.  My family loves sloppy joes and this one fits the bill.  Thank you for posting these....STephanie
286851,63689,2008-03-31,4,"We enjoyed this easy to put together recipe a lot. Very tasty. I used extra lean ground beef and Bull's Eye BBQ sauce, worked very well. Used two stalks of celery and I did not think it was too much, though my hubby, who doesn't care for celery, did pick some out. (So much for hiding it, huh? haha) Served with oven-fried onion rings, a perfect combo. Thanks for sharing!"
285039,63689,2008-04-24,5,"This sloppy joe sauce has great flavor.  Not too sweet, and a bit of tanginess.  I did not add the celery or the onion and added 1/2 t of onion powder instead.  Very good!"
101823,63689,2008-04-27,5,"I omitted the celery due to personal preference.  I just don't care for cooked celery, in most cases.  Also, I used spicy steak seasoning instead of regular salt and pepper.  My husband is fussy about his sloppy joes and bristles when he sees the brown sugar come out, as he doesn't care for an overly sweet sandwich.  These were great.  Love that they use ingredients that are always in my pantry and fridge."
74281,63689,2008-05-12,5,This is definitely the best Sloppy Joe recipe ever for my family's tastes. I did have to leave out the celery and onion (used 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder) as some at my house cannot digest them. As another reviewer suggested I also used 2 lbs of ground beef but did not double the sauce (except I did double the brown sugar as we like ours sweet) and it was plenty of sauce for us. This was so easy and delicious that I will never use any other recipe or canned sauce again!
386849,63689,2008-05-22,5,My mom made these and I thought they were great!
373817,63689,2008-07-29,5,These are fabulous! Everyone loved them.
185446,63689,2008-11-06,5,"As rater #355, I have nothing new to add to the long list of reviews.  This sauce does its job--is easy and tastes better than canned.  We liked it."
180090,63689,2009-01-17,5,"Yummy, yummy. My husband just ate sloppy joes for the first time and he loved them. This recipe is really good. I'll be making it again! Thank you!"
666723,63689,2009-03-19,5,I was asked to make sloppy joes but didn't have the paste and the packet that I usually use.  This recipe was a life saver.  I got a lot of compliments and everyone was surprised at how great these tasted since they weren't the kind we regularly have.  We used ground turkey for a healthier joe but everything else we did exactly.  Yum yum!
222433,63689,2009-03-20,4,Really good! Will make again. Nice change with the BBQ sauce! Thanks for posting.
937635,63689,2009-09-24,5,"Awesome recipe! We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ which is a lot sweeter than Open Pit, so I might omit the brown sugar if we use SBR next time. Hubby Loved it!"
353131,63689,2009-04-27,4,Made it without celery(used celery salt) added a bit more worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. This is a good recipe for sloppy jopes. It is quick. But not my favorite. Really good if you are in a hurry.
1122161,63689,2009-08-03,5,We really liked this recipe! Very flavorful and easy to throw together! Thanks for posting!
147109,63689,2009-08-18,5,"These were very good, a bit strong in the barbecue sauce flavor, but maybe that is just the kind I used....I might cut back on that some next time. Thanks, will use this again!"
189475,63689,2009-09-05,5,"SO good and SO easy! This is the perfect meal to make when you're short on time or just feeling lazy. I left out the celery because I didn't have it and I think I'd like it better without the celery anyways. It was too messy to eat as a sandwich so I just poured it over hamburger rolls and ate it with a fork. I'll definitely make this again, especially since it uses ingredients that I almost always have sitting around in the house."
1365025,63689,2009-11-22,4,"This was pretty good. I only used 1 stalk of celery and that was more than plenty for me. I think I must have added too much brown sugar as it was just a tad to sweet for my taste. I can't wait to try this again tomorrow as a fine wine gets better
 with age so does barbecue, chili and people."
1133190,63689,2010-03-09,5,This was really good.  I think I might doctor it up a little next time for fun but it was good as is!
768828,63689,2010-05-11,5,Wow this was good.  I made exactly as written except I doubled it and put in the crock pot when all ingredients were mixed together as we weren't eating until later.  This is my go to Sloppy Joes from now on.  Thanks.
1506604,63689,2010-05-12,5,It tasted good. Less than 2 stalks of celery suffices. Add green peppers is a nice touch also. It smelled like Manwich but I never tasted it so I know not if tasted like Manwich. Simple to make & delicious to eat!
232480,63689,2010-05-31,3,"We found this too sweet, although it could have been the barbeque sauce we chose.  My recipe is similar except for that, and I was looking for something different, but I think if I try this again I'll use a different sauce."
637486,63689,2010-07-16,5,"This was great!  I liked the hint of bbq flavor, although it was not overpowering.  I also really liked that it was not so tangy like the stuff you buy at the store.  The veggies had just enough bite to them that you knew they were there, which I really enjoyed.  I will be making this my staple sloppy joe recipe from now on!"
394077,63689,2010-09-06,4,"Very good and very easy to do.  I would reduce the celery to 2 stalks or maybe even 1.  Other than that, this is very popular with the kids."
203325,63689,2012-01-14,5,"These are wonderful.  It is a quick, simple to make dinner, after work.  My husband declared these one of his favorites."
73469,63689,2012-03-08,5,"Okay, this really doesn't need another review, but here goes. I had this really great sloppy joe recipe passed down to me from my husband's grandmother. He was wanting me to fix it, and low and behold I lost the recipe. This recipe was the closest one that I could find. It is pretty darn close. I left out the celery, but followed the instructions exactly otherwise. The flavor was really good and my husband could not tell that it wasn't his grandmothers. Thanks for saving me!!!"
175824,63689,2012-03-26,5,What can I say that hasn't been said already. This is delicious. I was taking lunch over to my sisters yesterday. I made it in the morning and we were eating sloppy joes before 10 am. I uses Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy Bar B Que sauce. Can't wait to have leftovers today. Thanks for posting Hey Jude.
315055,63689,2013-01-18,5,Excellent sloppy joes!  I use extra lean meat and it's delicious every time!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!
126440,63689,2013-01-30,4,"Did the pizza Joe's.  Very good, quick easy and simple."
37779,63689,2013-06-25,4,"Had a bunch of my kids&#039; friends over hanging out. They all wanted sloppy joes, so tried this out on them. Added just a little prepared mustard, cause couldn&#039;t taste the dry. Also would decrease celery to one rib. Easy to prepare and we enjoyed it. Thanks."
198154,63689,2013-09-04,4,"I was looking for a recipe for a kid friendly dinner the other night when I came across this.  We decided to go with the Pizza Joes version.  Very easy to make. But much to my surprise the kiddos didn&#039;t like them, while DH and I thought they were really good. UPDATE: While the family rated the Pizza Joe&#039;s 3 stars.  Tonight we made the Sloppy Joe&#039;s and we liked them better. I used a hickory smoke barbeque sauce and three stalks of celery.  The hickory smoke added great flavor and I would recommend it.  Next time, however, I will only use 2 stalks of celery. We all felt that 3 was too much.  Served with Cajun Jalapeno Poppers."
461834,63689,2014-02-05,5,"Nice and simple recipe for sloppy joes!!!  I scaled this back to 1/4 of the recipe, but followed as written for the recipe.  I just bought some celery the day before, it was very fresh and green and even after simmering for 45 mins., it was still crunchy when I ate my lunch, but that isn&#039;t the fault of the recipe but rather the super freshness of the celery.  My recipe is very similar but includes green pepper, which I did miss and would add it next time.  I used &quot;Montgomery Inn&quot; bbq sauce so it had a little kick which was nice.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for &quot;Best of 2013 Tag Game&quot;."
265954,63689,2014-09-11,5,"My family loved this. I made as directed except for the following: I didn&#039;t have celery, so I used a medium-sized green pepper, and I didn&#039;t have Worcestershire sauce, so I used A-1. I made this quickly on the skillet, toasted some slider buns, and had enough for 12 sliders for dinner over two days. Moist and tangy. The next time I make this, I think I may add a little more heat to my and my husband&#039;s portion by adding some red pepper flakes."
1581225,63689,2015-07-08,5,"Enjoyed by the family, easy, and  nice flavour."
68460,27210,2003-04-01,5,"Darn good grilled pork chops.  As some other reviews stated, I may reduce the oil next time I make this.  The lemon pepper seasoning is the key to this, I think.  My pork chop loving husband loved this and it looks like I'll no longer have to eat his burned up, dried out chops.  Thanks Kate for a real good recipe."
54678,27210,2004-04-15,5,"100 STARS! Man these were awesome - so moist and so flavorful. I had only 2 tbsp of lemon pepper so also used 1 tbsp lemon & herb seasoning. Also used 4 cloves garlic and had 8 chops with bone. Due to work hour conflicts, they ended up marinading for 5 hours. THE BEST EVER IN MY LIFE!!! "
55578,27210,2004-04-22,5,"This recipe makes very tender chops.  The flavor is very mild.  What a difference to ordinary pork chops, for once you can get a knife through even the thin ones!  Thank you, I'll definately make this again!"
38643,27210,2004-05-30,5,Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and marinated 5 boneless thick chops for about 5 hours. Everyone agreed they were moist and full of flavor. Will definately make these again.
37036,27210,2004-06-06,5,These pork chops turned out juicy and had a wonderful flavor.  I followed your directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing.
4470,27210,2004-07-09,5,Truely these are super - The picture says it all - I marinated them for about 3 hours.  They BBQ perfectly This is a do again recipe - can 27 reviews be wrong? Thanks Kate in Ontario for an easy excellent recipe
121185,27210,2004-07-14,5,Yum!!!  What a great marinade!  We marinated our chops for about 2 1/2 hours and I think that was the MINIMUM you would want - more flavor would have been even better!
55729,27210,2004-08-29,4,"A few easy ingredients, and big flavor. I like lemony meat, but I often get stuck with a too-tart result. Who knew that lemon pepper was the secret?! I broiled these, but look forward to grilling next time."
29782,27210,2005-05-08,5,This is differently a high 5 recipe! Loved it! I also let the pork chops marinade for several hours. The pork chops came out so tender and juicy. THanks for sharning a great recipe. Its differently a keeper!
175824,27210,2005-05-30,5,These were absolutly delicious. I follow the recipe exactly except I marinated them for about 6 hours prior to grilling. Everyone thought they were outstanding. Thanks so much for the recipe. This is a keeper.
173314,27210,2005-06-27,5,My whole family loved this!  Used 1/2 thick boneless porkchops and grilled about 15-20 minutes.  My husband compared them to the strip steaks w/marinade we have as a treat and definitely looks forward to having pork chops on the grill again. thanks..
173579,27210,2005-10-06,5,Excellent flavor.  I only marinaded mine for 2 hrs and thought that was plenty.  Thanks for posting such a tasty recipe.
203325,27210,2006-06-10,5,These truely are the best grilled pork chops.  I was a little concerned about the amount of lemon pepper but the marinade was perfect.  I marinated the pork overnight and they turned out really moist.
142367,27210,2006-08-27,5,Excellent and easy!  These were the best pork chops we've ever had. A five star keeper recipe that I know I will be asked for again and again.  Thank you so much for sharing!
140132,27210,2007-04-05,4,This was good and we will use this recipe again.  I love grilled chops and your marinade was the perfect flavoring for them.  Thank you for a great chop recipe....Stephanie
371738,27210,2007-05-03,5,Awesome! The best chops ever! Thank you for sharing the recipe with the rest!
461834,27210,2007-05-20,3,"I made this using two very large pork steaks(1 1/2 lbs) and followed directions exactly as stated. Its was way too peppery for us, we were not able to eat it, due to the overpowering pepper flavor. I think if I cut back to maybe one tablespoon or less of the lemon pepper, this would be a tasty recipe. Thanks for posting this recipe that I will try again but with changes."
482376,27210,2007-06-08,5,"These were incredible! My husband said that they were restaurant quality. I used Mrs. Dash lemon pepper and the amount was perfect and tasty. I would not change a single thing in this recipe. EASY..just mix the marinade ingredients into a large ziplock bag, put the pork chops in and leave it in the fridge until it's time to grill. I marinated them in the morning before going to work. When I got home, all I had to do was fire up the grill and make a salad..voila!! *Note - I had bought a pork loin and had the butcher slice into 1 inch chops. I would highly recommend doing this, as the outcome was succulent!*
Outstanding..you really should try this recipe!"
185446,27210,2007-07-03,4,"This was a very tasty recipe, although not a good choice to make if watching salt intake.  I'm a salt lover, and this was almost too salty for me."
44383,27210,2007-07-07,5,Excellent.  Marinated about 4 hours and the chops were very tasty. Nice and easy to do too. Thanks!
13483,27210,2007-07-28,5,These worked like a acharm on my new BBQ.  I did marinade my chops for about 5 hours.  I also scored them before putting them in the marinade.  A couple fresh veggies and a glass or two of good red wine and we had ourselves a terrific dinner.  Thanks for posting this Kate
218535,27210,2007-09-17,5,This is wonderful. My family ate all of it. I marinated my chops overnight.
126104,27210,2007-12-02,4,"These were very good.  I decided to also use fresh lemon juice, rather than the lemon pepper seasoning, but added pepper.  I then totally forgot I had these marinating, and after 2 days, they were dark brown.  I bought 2 more chops and put those on the bottom of my container with the overmarinated chops on top.  Actually, the ones that had been in there days were delicious!!!

Thanks, Kate, for a really quick and easy, not to mention wonderful, new recipe."
207176,27210,2008-02-27,5,"The family really liked it.  Mine were salty because my lemon-pepper seasoning had salt as an ingredient too so caution: check.  I smothered my chop in applesauce and the sweet - salty combo was nice.  My son said ""these asre Asian style"" so he noted the soy!  I marinated overnight and grilled on a grill pan since it is winter now.  Thanks."
93006,27210,2008-03-18,5,"I too was concerned about the 3T. lemon pepper as DH doesn't like tons of lemon flavor.  I need not have worried - the flavors are perfect with none overpowering the other.  Just subtle, wonderful grilled goodness.  Our favorite way to have pork chops now!"
497077,27210,2008-05-26,5,"DELICIOUS! These chops came out so moist and flavorful! I adjusted recipe for 4 chops, with just 1 Tablespoon of oil and marinated all day.  Leftovers were frozen and then made into sandwiches the following weekend and they were great, too! Thank you for a great recipe!!!"
470351,27210,2008-08-02,5,"Throwing my rating into the ring, however, it obviously doesn't need it!  EXCELLENT grilled pork!  I loved the flavor and even the marinade smelled amazing before cooking.  I found it a bit too salty for my tastes (but I'm not a huge fan of salty anything).  My husband is a salt fiend and found it to be the perfect amount of salt.  I will probably cut the lemon pepper next time to see if that cuts the saltiness.  I used low sodium soy sauce and increased the garlic to 4 cloves.  I had a lot of marinade left over.  May reduce the oil next time as well.  My husband gave this 5 and I gave it 4.5 so 5 stars it is!!  Great recipe!  This says a lot since my husband just barely tolerates pork but loved this!!  I may take another reviewers suggestion and add honey next time too.  I bet that would be delicious as well.  Thank you!"
180090,27210,2008-09-30,5,Very simple and easy recipe. Turned out moist and flavorful. Thanks for posting!
132383,27210,2009-04-22,5,Loved this marinade....we had a lot of rain the night we were going to make this so we ended up broiling....awesome!
135887,27210,2009-06-07,5,"This marinade is awesome! I kept them in the frig for about 8 hours before grilling. I also had 4 extra which I gave to my brother two days later and he loved them!

Update - we have been using this marinade for quite some time for chops.  Yesterday we marinated a pork loin and grilled it on our rotisserie - outstanding!!!  The pork was so tender and juicy - even better than the chops."
316717,27210,2009-06-17,5,i doubled the recipe but only put 1/4 cup of oil. marinated it overnight and it came out super flavorful. will definately make again. thanks!
355637,27210,2009-06-20,4,"Very tasty! Marinated for about 8 hours, very good."
242484,27210,2009-06-30,5,"I never thought I could make grilled pork chops that weren't all dried out but these were so tender, juicy and so flavorful and I only had to marinate them for 2 hrs!"
637486,27210,2009-07-02,3,"I liked the flavor of this marinade, but thought the lemon pepper was too over-powering.  I would like to make this again and might use only 1 tablespoon of the lemon pepper seasoning!"
133174,27210,2009-08-26,5,"I can well understand why this recipe has so many wonderful reviews.  The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and the chops were in the marinade all day.  They were tender, flavored and nicely seasoned.  The lemon pepper was reduced considerably.  This is a recipe I will make again."
632249,27210,2009-10-17,5,"I bought some beautiful thick pork chops today and thought that I would try this marinade. I did reduce the lemon pepper seasoning to 1 1/2 tbsp and the garlic to just 1 clove as my kids don't like things with too much spice.These chops were so juicy, tender and delicious! We absolutely loved this recipe so thanks for sharing!"
92816,27210,2010-03-14,5,These are perfect on my indoor grill.They have just the right amount of flovour with the lemon pepper seasoning.I halved the ingredients to make it for 2 servings.
33159,27210,2010-05-22,4,Really good - loads of flavour!
298447,27210,2010-06-17,5,"The name says it all...these are the Best Grilled Pork Chops I've ever had! I used the full marinade for 3 boneless (thick cut) pork loin chops. These beauties grilled up so plump and juicy...full of flavor! I used Recipe #1590 . I would highly recommend making your own Lemon Pepper Seasoning Mix as I found the fresh grated lemon to add to the flavor and aroma of this awesome dish! Lastly, I used leftover marinade (boiled to reduce cross contamination) to baste the chops. Wonderful recipe which will be enjoyed many times during this grilling season (and beyond)!"
178742,27210,2010-07-28,0,"I made this last night and it was absolutely wonderful!! The flavors and the tenderness were spot on! I tend to overcook pork because I'm afraid it won't be done. But this time I said i'm gonna be confident and follow the recipe exactly. And I did! I followed grilling times for chops 3/4"" or thinner. So I grilled 6 minutes each side. Even though you said 1-2 mins. less for side 2, I still did for same amount of time as side one. Anyway, my husband said I finally got it so right, that I could even sell these pork chops!! LOL! I followed ingredients exactly. Marinated for 2 hours, charcoal grill. I used 6 center cut bone-in. It was also the first time I used the Lemon Pepper seasoning. Again, the chops were lip smacking fantastic! We had corn-on-the-cob and parmasean noodles with it. Thank you for posting!!"
126440,27210,2011-07-01,5,Wonderful pork.  I marinated for 6 hrs. and then cooked as directed.  Turned out great and served with vegetable kabobs and grilled packet potatoes.  DH loved this meal.
53932,27210,2011-07-10,4,These were very tasty and moist.  The lemon pepper I used was a tad overpowering so I would cut back on that next time.  I think the marinade would be fine with less oil too.
1179225,27210,2011-08-06,5,"Hooray! I have now foud the BEST chop marinade. We loved this recipe. I used Penzey's Florida seasoning, only using just shy of 2 tablespoons, and let them marinate for about 8 hours. They came out perfect. Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe."
307214,27210,2011-09-23,5,Simple and awesome.  Works for camping too.
285039,27210,2012-03-10,5,"Marinated for just 3 hours, and they were delicious!  Quick and easy to put together for a  busy night!"
394077,27210,2013-04-21,5,My entire family loves this recipe.  I marinated them over night.  The chops came out moist and tender.  Very good recipe. Thank you for sharing it.
49304,28768,2002-11-14,5,"What can I say that hasn't been said, This is GREAT Lasagna.
Love the Combination of meat in the sauce. I used fresh Lasagna noodles. Very Good,I will be using this Recipe when I make Lasagna. Thank you for posting. ;)"
160974,28768,2004-10-14,5,"I've made similar tasting sauces, but what sets this recipe apart is the wonderful texture. The lasagne sets up beautifully and cuts like a dream. I did add a can of tomato paste water. I think the cottage cheese makes it more creamy than the ricotta, too."
32772,28768,2003-03-13,5,"Outstanding. The only change I made was to use 1/2 the cottage cheese amount and added 12 ounces low-fat ricotta cheese for a creamer blend.  The sausage adds such a great flavor to the lasagna. Next time, I will omit the sausage and add pepperoni instead. Served it with garlic green beans, side salad and Texas Toast."
51011,28768,2004-05-24,5,"Wow! This was sooooooo good! I made this for at my dh request for a good lasagna- we also invited friends over to share as well.  Only change I made was to use ricotta, and i used 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb italian sausage. Served it with sourdough bread and a crisp salad. Everyone loved it and it was even better the next day!  Thanks so much!"
37305,28768,2004-11-16,4,"Very tasty lasagna.  We really enjoyed this except I found it a little too salty and I'm a salt freak!  Love the combo of cheese and meats...VERY HEARTY!  My husband loves lasagna with meat and this certainly wasn't lacking!  I will definitely make again, just cut back a little on the salt."
52125,28768,2005-05-05,5,I've made this twice so far and both times it turned out wonderful and tasted excellent! The first time I made it with 2 pounds of ground beef and left the sausage out and used ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese. The next time I made it I followed your directions exactly. It was really yummy both ways! Thanks NurseDi....
180090,28768,2005-05-15,5,"This was delicious! I loved the flavor of the sauce, very hearty. It made a lot, so I'm going to freeze the leftovers for a night I don't feel like cooking. I don't like italian sausage because of the fennel seed in it, so I used basil and garlic sausage and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!"
229524,28768,2006-09-09,5,The title says it all.  It really is the Absolute Best!!! My husband said to throw out my other Lasagna recipes :)  Can't wait to share this with my friends.  Thanks sooooo much NurseDi for a fantastic recipe.
125640,28768,2007-07-31,4,"Not the best lasagna ever, but good. I added about 3/4 cup thawed frozen spinach to the cheese mixture, but followed the directions other than that. Will probably make again. Thanks for sharing."
229850,28768,2006-09-22,4,"Thought this was good, I liked the idea of mixing cheese with other ingredients instead of totally seperate, but I really think I like using the ricotta better. I will try it again using ricotta and adding a tad bit of wine."
142559,28768,2006-10-28,5,"OUTSTANDING lasagna!! This is a new staple in our house! Not too difficult to make, at least it wasn't for me. In other lasagnas I've had before, the cheese mixture in between the layers was always 'eh' and 'so-so' - this was incredible! If it weren't for the eggs in it, I would eat it straight by itself!! LOL! Thanks Nurse Di, this is a REAL winner!"
307214,28768,2006-11-30,5,Wow!  This was great.
37449,28768,2006-12-09,5,"My daughter and I made this for a dinner which her new boyfriend attended. He was impressed and everyong enjoyed it. Left out the sausage, used canned spahgetti sauce. Thanks Di!"
407007,28768,2007-05-10,5,"BEST lasagna ever is RIGHT! :) this was so good. I substituted ricotta for cottage cheese and might not use whole tomatoes next time but rather chopped or paste, but the taste WAS DIVINE!!! loved it! thanks nursedi!"
140132,28768,2007-06-22,5,"I made this the other night and it was the ""best ever"".  We love lasagna and have tried many.  Its not that we dont like the others but haven't quite found ""the"" one.  Well now we have found ""the"" one.  This is a great tasting casserole that i served with a lettuce salad and garlic bread.  Superb........Stephanie"
222433,28768,2007-06-23,5,"I did not use any ground beef, only 1 lb of Italian sausage. Everything else was exactly the same. My family says it is the best lasagna I have ever made! Thanks for making me look great! Having the leftovers for lunch today. No question I will make this again!"
252816,28768,2007-10-28,5,"Don't look any further,this is the Best..I did fudge with the recipe alittle..I added 1/2 tsp fennel, 1 tsp Italian seasoning and increased the basil to 1 1/2 tsp.I used 1 pound sweet italian sausage and decreased beef to 3/4 pound.I also used ricotta cheese...Everyone loved this lasagna..Laminated this recipe.."
92816,28768,2008-01-06,5,"We have just finished this for our supper and I had to come in and review it right away.The name is true for sure!I have been using the same Lasagna recipe for quite awhile now but was on the hunt for something better,this is it.The only changes I made was to use one can of tomatoes,which was still plenty and I added mushrooms and green peppers to the meat sauce.Thanks for such a great recipe!"
499050,28768,2008-01-23,5,Yum!
158086,28768,2008-02-14,5,"I made this last night for company...it was wonderful, and it held up great when you cut into it...I had a lasagna that the layers fall apart when you cut into it....I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese"
18391,28768,2008-04-12,5,Excellent recipe! My DH loved it! I used a little less meat because it was all I had. I also used 2t each of the herbs. Thanks for a great recipe!
248023,28768,2008-04-28,5,"I love to order lasagna when we go out to eat just because I am too lazy to make my own.  I am glad my BF begged me for homemade lasagna this week since this was absolutely delicious.  From the tasty and meaty sauce to the way it cuts like a dream... this is a 5 star recipe all the way.  My BF doesn't like Italian sausage but when it was mixed in with the ground beef... it just made the sauce tastier than if it had been all beef.  I did add in just a tad more canned tomatoes ( just because they were in the fridge and needed to be used up)  and loved the fact that it made the lasagna a little ""saucier"" which is what we like.  I used 15 oz of ricotta and the remainder cottage cheese because the store had it on sale...  great combo.  I topped it with whole milk mozzarella that I sliced thinly... so stringy and gooey delicious.  Thanks for a keeper!!!"
377581,28768,2008-05-30,5,This is fantastic! I added a small can of olives to the sauce. It came out great! It was very easy & very tasty. Thank you!
774665,28768,2008-06-17,5,Oh my chubby thighs!! This is the BEST lasagna I have EVER had. No kidding! I didn't make a single change--why mess with perfection! My husband tells me he'd divorce me and marry you to keep eating this and that is HUGE because we are in wedded bliss.
185446,28768,2008-09-30,4,"This lasagna has enough four/five star reviews to try at least once, if not more often.  The basic meat sauce/cheese mixture is very tasty, and as other reviewers' personal additions testify, the recipe is also very adaptable.  The absolute best?  I'm not so sure about that, but it is good and easy."
145352,28768,2008-12-28,5,Loved it Di!!!!!! Was soooo very good and really rather easy!
55578,28768,2009-01-03,5,"Great!  DD said it was the best lasagna I ever made.  I used 1 sm can of fire-roasted tomatoes and 1 of diced tomatoes.  Used the cottage cheese, as that what my family likes the best.  Tx for the recipe."
265954,28768,2009-06-25,5,"Delicious and so easy to make.  I tweaked by browning the sausage separately and then crumbling into the ground beef mixture.  I also added garlic powder to same.  I'm not a fan of ricotta or cottage cheese, so I reduced the ricotta cheese to 15 oz.. I made two small pans and am freezing one.  Great recipe!  REVISION:  I've now made this lasagna several times with ricotta, and then with cottage cheese and prefer the cottage cheese!  Not overpowering at all, although I still use only 15-18 oz. of cottage cheese instead of the amount recommended.  I make this recipe at least once a month. :)"
486718,28768,2009-07-21,5,Excellant!!  This was easy and fed my family for three days!! I made with ricotta and cottage combined and left everthing else the same.  The top layer did get a little hard but it didn't bother me any!!  Thanks!!
318235,28768,2009-09-18,5,"Wow! Delicious...I used half ground chuck and half lean ground beef because that is what I had but I am excited to try it again with the sausage. Also, we enjoyed the taste of this with the cottage cheese but I can't say that it made the dish one way or the other so I would say the ricotta and cottage cheese are pretty interchangeable here. Also, I used no boil noodles and the ones on top didn't really cook because I didn't put more sauce on top so if you do opt for no boil then put more sauce on the last layer and then the extra mozzarella. Thank you!"
168462,28768,2009-11-04,5,This was a definite hit in my house and my husband said it was worth at least ten stars. It is not difficult to make with impressive results. Thanks for the recipe.
37868,28768,2009-12-10,4,You are right!! This is Absolute. I used your recipe and followed it just like you have it. Very Very good..I will not change nothing. Thank You for sharing. Hugs
126440,28768,2010-05-13,5,"I made this again using Recipe #347336 for the sauce(I had it in the freezer).  I put some of the sauce over the noodles and then topped with the cheese.  Excellent lasagna.  I had to make due with what I had on hand because of the nearly four feet of snow we have.  Only had 15 oz. of ricotta, and six oz. tomato paste.  I may save some sauce to put on top of the last layer of noodle then top with cheese as mine were very tough."
768828,28768,2011-01-03,5,"I've been making the same lasagna for over 50 years - the recipe from Better Homes & Garden.  I've always really liked it.  Rather than dig out my recipe, I looked on Food.com to see if i could find a similar one.  This was really close, but used more meat and more spices.  This was awesome - I won't be going back to my old recipe - this is the one I will use from now on.  Thanks so much for posting."
251626,28768,2011-04-25,5,Absolutely great. Would not change anything. Even great reheated.
177933,28768,2011-08-21,5,"Yum... I haven't even eaten the lasagna yet, but I know it's going to be awesome because of the sauce! I used a large 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, other than that I followed your ingredients for the sauce exactly. I let it simmer for over an hour adding chicken broth every so often and letting it cook down (like a ragu) and then in the end I added a cup of milk and let it cook down again. It is so delicious! I used 1/2 fat free ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese. Can't wait until it's done! Thanks!!"
198154,28768,2011-12-27,3,"I was looking for a lasagna recipe that I had made before.  I forgot to save it and couldn't find it in all the lasagna recipes on here. After spending way too much time searching, I decided to make this one instead because of it's rave reviews.  While everyone thought it was good, no one went back for seconds.  It worked in a bind though.  Thanks."
189475,28768,2012-01-17,5,"Perfect!! I used leftover sauce (recipe #26217) and I left out the parmesan inside the lasagna. Instead I just sprinkled parmesan on top of it after it was done. I used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and I used no-boil lasagna noodles. Since I used the no-boil noodles, I cooked the lasagna for 50 mins. I covered it with aluminum foil for the first 40 mins so that the mozzarella on top wouldn't get burnt. This was better than any lasagna that I've ever got at a restaurant!"
540346,28768,2012-08-23,4,"This was a hit tonight.  I served it with crusty french bread (#101476) with olive oil and herbs and it was delicious.  Great meal.  I ended up using 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb italian sausage.  Other than that everything remained the same.  I had enough cheese mixture and meat sauce left to cover the top layer of noodles with more of both and then topped with mozzarella.  Lasagna is a great meal that just takes so much time, but it is worth it in the end."
1179225,28768,2012-12-25,5,"Yep! It's the best lasagna ever! I think we have a new tradition for Christmas dinner. I assembled it yesterday. I used 1lb. of ground turkey and 1lb. of spicy pork sausage, cottage cheese and added a little more seasoning to that mixture, crushed tomatoes instead of whole. I only had one can of tomato paste, and used no boil noodles. I added about a up and a half of water to the sauce as per the directions on noodle package . I like sauce on the top, so I just saved some to use on top. I baked it covered for 1/2 hour and uncovered for 15 mins. It came out PERFECT! Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe."
789516,28768,2012-12-31,5,my mom made this and it was awesome.  only downside is it is quite expensive to make.
199020,28768,2013-07-15,5,"Yummy lasagna! I did use regular spaghetti sauce instead of making it, though. Next time, I&#039;ll put it in a bigger pan because I didn&#039;t have room for everything in my 9x13. Thanks!"
1581225,28768,2016-11-08,3,"I didn't really love this, I don't like Italian sausage in meat pasta sauces, plain ol ground beef is best for me. I prefer my lasagne classic, with a proper bechamel sauce."
218535,28768,2018-02-05,3,Felt that it needed tomato paste or tomato sauce
222564,87782,2011-07-28,5,Fantastic recipe!
26512,92095,2004-06-14,5,"These are excellent meatballs! I used fresh garlic and I loved the oregano in these! I had never cooked meatballs in the sauce either, and it was making the guys really nervous, but they turned out perfect. I did use your sauce recipe and it's a great combination of flavors. I really loved the texture of these meatballs as well.Will definitely be making these again, thanks for sharing!"
60992,92095,2004-06-22,5,"This is almost the identical recipe to the one my Aunt got from a little old Italian lady she worked with....EXCEPT for the milk. I just had to try this to see what difference if any the milk made. And it DOES make a difference! You get a much more delicate textured meatball by adding the milk. I followed directions exactly except for doubling the recipe. One bit of advice I would offer is make the meatballs with slightly moistened hands...works SO much better. Thanks Allie-Pie for this recipe, I will always add milk to my meatballs from now on! "
37036,92095,2004-06-24,5,"Very good meatballs!  I followed your directions exactly and my whole family liked them.  My recipe for meatballs is very similar, except that I use wet bread (soaked in water, milk or wine - depending on what I feel like) and fresh garlic.  I normally bake my meatballs before putting them in the sauce, but I do make a Mexican soup with meatballs that you drop raw into the sauce.  I've often thought of doing it with my Italian meatballs, but I just wasn't sure.  But they turned out great! Thanks for sharing!  "
8688,92095,2004-06-29,5,"These meatballs were excellent, Allie!  I made them to go along with your sauce and the combination made a delicious supper! I changed nothing about the recipe and used Parmesan.  Thanks, Allie!"
59780,92095,2004-07-09,5,"Wow! Add me to the list of fans who love these meatballs! I was astounded at how simple and inexpensive this meal was and it still tasted fantastic! I paid just over $4.00 for almost 600g of meat (I realize this is over a pound but I was feeding a hungry crowd)Everything else for this recipe is a staple and so I already had in the house. I made 24 giant meatballs with the meat mixture. I simmered them in your sauce in my crockpot on high for 4 and a half hours. The whole house smelled delicious. I fed my parents, my three children, my niece, nephew, my husband (who I might add, are all big eaters) and myself and still had leftovers! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, we all enjoyed it and it will be made again soon. "
189616,92095,2005-05-31,5,"Another great one posted by In*Memory*of* Brats!. My youngest DS requested Spaghetti 'n Meatballs for his Birthday supper, and since he is so special to us, had to make sure his supper was as special. We were not dissapointed. The meatballs were softer than what we are used to, but of course to be expected due to cooking method. This were great, my Hub and Boys could not stop raving about them!
Thanks SO Much!"
124249,92095,2005-06-18,5,"I usually don't eat meatballs with my spaghetti but since I made them for everyone else I tried one and they were pretty good. My whole family liked them.

Thanks In*Memory* of Brats.

Bullwinkle."
68960,92095,2005-09-02,5,These meatball are so tender. The trick must be the milk. Excellent kid friendly recipe that we all really enjoyed. Thanks for posting.
37305,92095,2005-10-03,5,"These were great!  I decided to try these because my meat was 90% lean and I thought the milk would keep the meatballs moist.  I doubled the recipe and there's hardly any left.  I wasn't sure if the breadcrumbs were supposed to be dry or fresh.  I read somewhere that 1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs equals 2 slices of bread, so I used 4 slices of white bread broken in small bits.  I used Locatelli for the cheese and it added a lot of flavor.  I did fry these in olive oil before the onions and garlic for your sauce recipe; then I dropped them in the sauce.  Awesome meatballs and wonderful cooked in the sauce.  Thanks for sharing!"
185285,92095,2005-11-14,5,"Ok.. there are a great many meatball recipes out there, and when it comes to seasoning - it is very much personal preference. So, IMHO the 'keys' in the recipe are:  1. The milk in the meatballs makes them rich and helps to keep them moist.  2. Cooking your meatballs in the sauce keeps them moist, gives your sauce a heartier 'meat' flavor throughout, opens up stovetop space, and grants you flexibility on cook time (I did mine on low heat in an uncovered stockpot for 4 hours). I used 94% lean meat and some italian sausage and it worked great."
52125,92095,2006-12-05,5,Great recipe! I doubled the recipe and we all enjoyed them very much!! Thanks ~In*Memory*of*Brats~....
74652,92095,2006-12-13,3,These were good.  We didn't care for the taste of Oregano in them though. They had a very nice texture and I liked that you didn't have to fry them first.
137911,92095,2007-12-05,5,"Mmmmm, delicious meatballs!  I cooked them in the sauce as you suggested which is also how I usually cook my meatballs.  They are so tender and flavorful.  I didn't need to simmer them for the 3 hours though...I would say about 40 minutes and they were done.  Thanks for sharing."
40961,92095,2007-12-10,5,"I followed the recipe exactly except for using dried parsley. Delicious tasting meatballs. Everyone enjoyed them, thanks for sharing."
140132,92095,2008-01-08,5,Delicious....perfect meatballs...thank you.
632249,92095,2008-02-05,5,Great meatballs!  My son is very picky about meatballs and he ate quite a few of these. I did bake these for 1/2 hr at 400F just to remove some extra fat. They held together very well. Will definitely make again. Thx.
207176,92095,2008-02-28,3,"We found that these were OK.  There is nothing wrong with them, just not a favorite for us.  I did find them soft and tender from simmering in the sauce."
355637,92095,2008-08-20,3,"I'm not sure about these... I almost found them a little mushy. I am a texture freak though, and what bugs me likely wouldn't bug others. The flavor was good though."
307214,92095,2009-04-25,5,Excellent.
53932,92095,2009-11-14,4,Good meatballs.  I think next time I would add more salt and fresh garlic.  I baked mine in a 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes.
369715,92095,2009-12-19,5,These were good and easy to make. They smelled so good cooking. I doubled the recipe and used Ragu marinara sauce. Next time I would make my own marinara sauce. We ate a few for dinner and I froze two packages of meatballs for later dinners. It was so awesome to be able to put the meatballs directly in the sauce and not have to cook them in the oven first. Will be making again.
126440,92095,2011-07-13,5,"So tender and great flavors.  I did use half beef and half pork and sauteed for a couple min. on both sides then put into my sauce.  Served with homemade ravioli, french bread and Maggiano's salad."
333017,92095,2012-06-06,5,"I made these up as written, and we really enjoyed them!  Just dropped them into the sauce and let them simmer for 3 hours.  My guests really enjoyed them!  Thanks for the posting"
178742,92095,2013-01-03,5,I can't believe i've never rated this recipe or reviewed it because i've been using this recipe for at least 3 years now! It is the best.. i follow recipe exactly. Except for sometimes I brown the my meatballs in the oven for color. Also I always use ground turkey. Thanks for the awesome recipe!
839492,92095,2014-02-26,5,"Excellent, kids loved them!  I added a bit of ground cayenne pepper, but otherwise, very quick to put together &amp; will be a repeat. Served with angel hair pasta &amp; garlic cheese bread. Thanks for sharing."
1581225,92095,2017-04-21,5,"Wow, I made these with the sauce recipe in the description. Perfection! The meatballs, which were mixed and rolled with the help of my 7 year old son (he had a ball) came out perfectly, flavourful and tender. I followed the recipe to a tee and served them with spaghetti. I don't know why some commenters are so worried about broiling or cooking the meatballs first. You don't need to, it's just a waste of valuable time. Mine stayed together just fine. The trick, I think is to make the meatballs first and let them sit for a bit while you start the sauce so the breadcrumbs can absorb the egg and juices which in my opinion helps bind them together. Also, just gently drop each ball into the sauce and don't stir for a while until they are cooked. The raw meatballs, as I read in another comment are also supposed to help flavour the sauce as they cook. I can certainly agree with that. I am keeping this recipe to make again and I will continue to make it as written. This is one of those very rare meals that pleases everyone in my fussy family."
218535,92095,2018-09-23,3,There are better meatball recipes on this site
39835,44888,2002-11-26,5,"Delicious! I used a chicken drumlets and chicken legs instead of chicken wings, garlic salt instead of garlic and regular salt and got rave reviews for this simple-to-make chicken dish. My ds couldn't stop eating these! We will definitely be making these again soon. Thanks for posting this delicious keeper recipe."
8629,44888,2003-09-21,5,Very good!  I cut the recipe in half and it worked out great.  The wings needed the entire hour plus about 10 - 15 minutes to crisp up.
117565,44888,2003-12-16,5,Amazing and easy.  I threw everything in a roaster except the oil (didn't think it necessary)and it baked to perfection.  I have made these three times in the last month.  Every party I go to they ask for these.  Thanks.
59163,44888,2004-01-17,5,My husband's employees were at our house putting on a new deck so I served this as part of their lunch. It got great reviews.  My husband thought this was delicious. I thought it was very simple to make. The leftovers were good the next day. Thanks for the recipe!!
29014,44888,2004-01-18,5,"Bergy does it again!  Another great appetizer.  I followed the recipe as posted except for using 1/2 cup of brown sugar with the honey (I only had 1/2 cup of honey on hand).  Also, I prepared everything ahead of time, coated the wings, and then covered and refrigerated until time to bake - so easy to do!
Thanks for another winner, Bergy!!"
4470,44888,2006-03-10,5," I have had a rather busy week so haven't fussed a lot with recipes -   I wanted some wings saw your recipe and decided that this iwas easy and sounded good - it has all the flavors I love and did not let me down -    -  Thanks Theresa Thunderbird for posting this delicious, easy & tasty recipe"
52125,44888,2006-09-14,5,These are some of the best tasting wings I've ever tried. They turned out so tender and yet very nicely glazed and tasted oh so great! I will make this recipe lots more. Thanks Theresa/ Thunderbird....
172369,44888,2006-10-04,5,"Very Good, I cooked and drained off fat before adding sauce and it still did not thicken, but the flavore was fantastic, next time I cook these uncovered and I think the sauce will thicken, definately a keeper , thanks."
347822,44888,2006-10-22,5,"AWESOME!  I used chicken legs w/ skin.  I let them marinade for 1 hour and they came out very moist and full of flavor.  Definitely, a keeper. "
68960,44888,2006-10-28,4,"This made for a quick and easy, throw together meal. Cooking time was perfect. Thanks for posting."
312577,44888,2006-12-15,5,The flavor of these wings was perfect. I did find (like other reviewers) that the sauce never really thickened.  The wings tasted great and went perfectly with the chow mein I made to go with them.  Thank you for the recipe.
316717,44888,2007-01-24,5,my hubby gives this 5 stars. he said it was really good...sweet and sticky. i followed fairy godmother's suggestion and baked the chicken first for a few...then mixed everything else in a baking dish and finished it. i cheated and put the oven temperature at 400 because i was in a hury. very tasty. and ingredients are usually in my pantry. A+! thank you for sharing!!!!
158086,44888,2007-02-04,5,These were a big big hit at my sunday dinner....I used sugar free honey and they turned out fabulous...I too cooked minea half hour first and drained...
47907,44888,2007-03-29,5,I served these at our Open House last weekend and they were a big hit!  I made as posted and they were very easy to put together.  There were no leftovers :)  Thanks for posting!
394077,44888,2007-04-11,5,Excellent wings.  My family loves these.  I had to bake them  for 1 hour and 30 minutes to get the wings to caramelized.  It was worth the wait.  The only thing I would change is to reduce the soy sauce a bit.
227607,44888,2007-05-13,4,These were pretty good but very fatty tasting.  Next time I will cook them on a broiler pan for part of the time to get some of the fat out of the chicken then do in the baking pan with the sauce mixture.  The flavor of the sauce is really good though.
185285,44888,2007-08-27,4,"Great Teriyaki-style wing recipe that uses ingredients you have on hand. When I make these again, I might give the sauce a kick of spice for a little extra flavor. I didn't pre-bake my wings, but think next time I might so that the sauce does not get dilluted."
402559,44888,2007-09-02,5,"I used this with chicken breasts instead and they came out great! Thanks so much, will make again."
499050,44888,2007-10-26,5,Yum.
140132,44888,2008-01-20,4,"We liked these.  I poured the fat off the pan after about a 1/2 hour and that seemed to help.  I think it needs that ""something"" else though.  We are going to make these again and maybe ""tweak"" it to fit our personal tastes, but good base recipe....thanks, Stephanie"
160974,44888,2008-09-29,5,"We enjoyed this marinade on wings and chicken breasts. We used our gas grill to cook these.  Thanks Theresa, for posting.
Roxygirl"
248023,44888,2008-03-27,4,"I have been craving wings lately and have a stash in the freezer that I bought when they went on sale...  I used a little over 2 lbs of wings so I cut down all the ingredients just slightly...  I know from experience that the kind of soy sauce I prefer ( a good mushroom soy) is saltier than your usual run of the mill... so I used only about of 1/4 of the called for amount.  I also drastically cut back on the honey...  I could hardly wait for them to come out of the oven!!!  They smelled so good.  I had them with some jasmine rice and it was just perfect.  They were so sticky, gooey, and lick your finger delicious!  Thanks for sharing!!!"
125640,44888,2008-06-29,5,"Great flavor. Very fast and easy to throw together from ingredients I usually have on hand. I have used both wings and legs in this and both work great. The meat was moist and tender with a sticky and really yummy glaze. I may try adding a 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger or 5-spice powder to the glaze in future, but it's great just the way it is. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing."
40961,44888,2008-07-13,5,Wow! this may be one of the best tasting chicken dishes I've tried. I had all the ingredients in the house except for the chicken. I used drumsticks with skin. It was perfect at 1 hour. The sauce is amazing. It would be good over noodles or rice. thanks for sharing your recipe.
184723,44888,2008-11-14,5,"I made these last night as a treat for my family... and boy they were GOOD!!!!!  I did remove sauce after the 1 hour of cooking and let the wings brown an extra ten minutes.  While they were browning... I thickened the sauce in a saucepan with cornstarch and after thickening, poured about 3/4 over the chicken wings.  The remaining 1/4 of sauce, I served over mashed potatoes for my family and not only did my husband eat about 1/2 of them, my 1 year old ate more than I've ever seen her eat!  This is a keeper!  My family requested I make these once a week now!"
138429,44888,2009-03-17,5,"Not much more that I could say that has not already been said. Delicious, a recipe that will call for many repeats .So very easy to make  with wonderful flavor. Thanks for sharing."
145352,44888,2009-06-10,5,Very good. Way too much sauce. Could easily use twice as much wings. Kinda teriyaki in flavor.
189475,44888,2012-02-13,5,Excellent! The only issue I had was that the sauce didn't caramelize even though I increased the temperature to 450 for the last 10 mins
218535,44888,2010-01-12,3,This good but Recipe #13707 is better. Thus the 3 stars.
1506604,44888,2010-04-14,5,"Very good, a lot of sauce which I guess is better than not enough. And so easy, this the type of food you can make 3 times a week!"
377581,44888,2010-05-19,4,It smells great baking and tastes just as good. The sauce is very flavorful and the prep is quick and very easy. I precooked the wings on a foil lined pan for 20 minutes and drained off the fat. Then I added the sauce. I also turned the wings as they cooked. Thank you.
1269015,44888,2010-06-19,5,"I made this with cubed tofu instead of the chicken and added a bit of crushed red pepper to the sauce. I only had to cook it about 45 minutes before the edges started to blacken. It was awesome, thanks so much!"
362983,44888,2011-01-19,5,This was great. I used a touch less honey and some cayenne for some spice. Thanks!
1122161,44888,2011-05-20,5,"I made these as stated except I used only 2pds of wings. I did turn them three times during baking, and they were delicious! I also have plenty of sauce left over to make these again, or maybe with pork ribs. Thanks for posting!"
377039,44888,2013-03-07,4,"After following the directions precisely, these were delicious and my husband won't stop raving about them!  The only change I would make is to follow reviewer Greg's suggestions of partially cooking, then draining the fat before adding the sauce.  Be very careful not to overcook; the first time I made them I overcooked the sauce and it was inedible! Made properly, this sauce would be great over many different types of foods."
195589,44888,2015-01-10,5,"Excellent!  I did what other reviewers did and cooked for 15 minutes then draining the fat/juice prior to adding the sauce. Also, for the sauce, I subbed 2T of BBQ sauce for the ketchup and added more minced garlic. I lined my pan with tin foil for easy clean-up. There was an abundance of sauce, so I only poured about 1/2 on the wings, I will save the rest for something else. Thanks for posting!"
894666,44888,2017-01-17,5,"This was so yummy for how quickly it came together, love that the marinade is stuff I always have on hand. Used breasts, baked on a rack for 15 mins @ 375 to drain fats/juices, took racks out, flipped chicken, poured some marinade on top, baked another 15 mins, flipped again, more marinade, baked another 15ish mins basting every few mins. Finished under broiler to thicken sauce. Flavor was spot on, will save and make again when I want a quick n easy chicken recipe, thanks!"
149363,95068,2004-12-10,5,"AWESOME!!
This was so good, the only thing I would do differently would be to puree the cauliflower so it had the consistency of mashed potatoes. Just a personal thing though!It was really a very delicious dish and we will be making it again.
Well written and easy to follow recipe, thanks so much for sharing!"
29782,95068,2005-02-25,5,"Very good recipe! Really does taste like a loaded baked potatoe but made with cauliflower.
You wouldnt know you wasn't eating potatoes.
Excellent flavor! Thanks for sharing your recipe."
35526,95068,2005-05-31,5,YUM.  Very tasty side dish for the low carbers.  The two of us finished off the whole dish.  I used low fat sour cream but full fat cheese.  I left out the bacon entirely.  We will have this again for sure.
103876,95068,2005-07-04,5,Very fancy and tasty cauliflower dish.  Even my kids liked it.  Thanks for posting.
185285,95068,2005-10-15,5,Fantastic!!  I boiled my cauliflower for about 8 minutes before putting them in the stove.  I added a bit of parm cheese as well and used FF sour cream.  A new staple!!
188119,95068,2005-12-03,5,"This was really good!  I didn't have any green onions or bacon, so I just used dried chives instead.  Also I only had mozzarella cheese instead, but it still tasted very good... Thanks!"
248023,95068,2006-02-17,5,"Very yummy indeed!  My BF and I are not on low carb diets, but I decided to 'sneak' this dish in one night.  He could not believe that it was cauliflower.  I also loved it, and I have never been a fan of this vegetable.  The only changes I made was to add 1-2 Tbs of finely grated romano cheese that I had leftover from the night before. It added so much flavor and richness. I also pureed the cauliflower after zapping it in the microwave... it was almost the exact consistency of mashed potatoes.  You must try it... it will change your mind about cauliflower forever!"
132383,95068,2006-03-04,5,"My fiance bragged and bragged about this dish.  We are not low carbing it...we just want some new and different side dishes.  I liked it, but wasn't amazed by it.  It will be repeated many times by us though because my fiance couldn't get enough of it. Thanks!"
135887,95068,2006-03-12,4,Pretty good - not sure if I'll make this again.  I pureed the cauliflower but the texture was still a little odd
22015,95068,2006-03-16,5,"We didn't care that much for other ""mock"" potato dishes.   This one was a big hit with my dh and my picky dd (although she said she could taste the cauliflower).   It was great and will be the one mock potato dish that we make again."
125640,95068,2006-04-24,5,"Excellent. I wasn't sure about the texture at first, but I got over it by the 2nd or 3rd bite because it just tased so good. I think as long as you go into it thinking of it as a cauliflower dish rather than expecting it to be like potatoes, the texure's great. I steamed frozen cauliflower, used turkey bacon, cut down a little on the sour cream, cut the green onions by half,  added an extra 1/4 cup cheddar, and added a little grated parmesan reggiano. DH couldn't stop raving about it. No leftovers for us."
377581,95068,2006-12-01,4,"Easy to prepare. I used about 1/2 the green onion, but made as directed other than that. Too much sour cream and not enough cheese for our tastes, but still really good. We will make this again. Thanks."
9869,95068,2007-03-02,5,"Excellent recipe, we are eating low carb and this recipe was suggested to me. Great flavours and easy to put together. Thanks for sharing. I served with prime rib."
140132,95068,2008-01-06,5,"This was very good.  I didn't mash or puree the cauliflower as we wanted this for a vegetable dish, so I just chopped the cauliflower up.  It was so good.  I followed the recipe exactly, it was fabulous.  Thank you for another cauliflower recipe my kids loved....Stephanie"
369715,95068,2008-06-16,4,I liked these but my family wasn't crazy about them. I followed the recipe as written other then I didn't use green onions as we don't like them. I also used Hormel bacon pieces. This was something different but my family would rather have potatoes (and I am the only one that low carbs)
207176,95068,2009-03-12,4,It was good and DH is diabetic so I choose it for him. He liked it a lot.  I liked it OK as did one son but my younger son didn't go for it.  I should say that I made it without bacon and that I would puree or mash finer next time. Thanks!
55578,95068,2009-04-14,4,"It was good.  I pureed the cauliflower. I really dislike cauliflower, but you are right, with the extra ingredients it kinda tastes like potatoes."
142559,95068,2009-06-07,4,This was very good! I did puree my cauliflower (not completely) and omitted the bacon only because I was out. I added some red pepper flakes and made as directed and it was really good!!  Will be a staple!
1365025,95068,2009-12-03,4,This was pretty good. I only used half of the sour cream but still was just a little too much for my taste. Next time I'll try using about 1/4 cup and see how that taste. I'm thinking this will make a good dish for potlucks. Will try it out come summer for our family reunion. This would be a good dish to try for people who don't like cauliflower.
1122161,95068,2010-03-17,5,"I used a head of cauliflower and it worked great. Mashed with a potato masher just until crumbly and it was the perfect consistensy for me, (I don't like how it can get watery when you puree it) This made 4 large servings. Thanks for posting!"
137911,95068,2010-06-29,5,Soooo yummy!!!  I halved the recipe for the 3 of us and use cajun season salt for taste.  Really a great way to prepare cauliflower which can usually be pretty boring.  Thanks for sharing!
131021,95068,2011-05-03,5,"I didn't cut the cauliflower small, because we like cauliflower but it was really good. I could have eaten the whole dish. Yum."
632249,95068,2011-12-30,5,"Loved this!  I reduced the sour cream to 1/2 C per reviews and it was great.  I also reduced the green onions by about half as that was all I had on hand.  Excellent recipe, will definitely make again. Thank you."
33159,95068,2012-05-27,4,What a great idea!!  It was good enough to make my cauliflower-hatin' husband eat it!  I just thought the sour cream flavour was stronger than anything else.  Next time I will try with fat free ranch dressing or less of the fat free sour cream.
76951,95068,2013-04-07,5,Loved it!
2549237,95068,2014-02-03,5,"LOVED THIS!  It was amazingly delicious and really, very easy to make.  I used fresh cauliflower that I steamed before baking.  I made this to go along with a spinach stuffed chicken and steamed baby carrots for a rather healthy and low carb dinner.  I used the measurements listed and got enough to make 6 side dish portions.  Will be making this time and again I am sure.  Thank you Helping Hands."
928301,95068,2014-03-23,4,"I thought it tasted good, but was more work than I&#039;d want for an ordinary side dish--having to pre-cook the bacon and cauliflower then having to bake everything after mixing it all together &amp; layer it uses too many dishes.  Might be good if asked to bring a side for something, but I wouldn&#039;t want to go through all this for a regular dinner night."
285039,95068,2014-09-03,5,"So very delicious!  I used frozen cauliflower,  low fat sour cream, and only one green onion.  It came perfect!  I will definitely make this again!"
198154,95068,2016-12-30,4,I made these for dinner tonight. I didn't make any changes and made the recipe as written. I didn't eat any but my family seemed to enjoy them. They gave them 4 stars.
18391,55673,2003-11-16,5,"This is excellent, my husband and I both loved it .. I will reduce the juices over the stovetop next time to make a sauce, thanks!"
55578,55673,2004-01-17,5,"Very nice Barb! I used 6 legs and put everything in a ziplock bag, shook it up and put in the oven. The taste was nice and ""THERE""!"
169969,55673,2005-01-10,5,"The chicken came out moist and tasty! Next time I will use more vinegar. I served it with  Derf's Fresh Green Beans with Garlic (12423), Sweet and Spicy Sweet Potatoes (78953) and the awesome Artichoke Bruchetta.
Thanks for a great chicken recipe!"
137911,55673,2006-02-01,5,"We really enjoyed this.  I used a ""Tastefully Simple"" Spinach and Herb Mix instead of oregano.  The baslamic gave this a nice flavor, different from ordinary baked chicken.  My family enjoyed it.  "
146486,55673,2006-09-21,5,This was so tender and delicious!  I love how easy it is to prepare and the taste is just fabulous! The only thing I changed was I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and baked them for 25 minutes. Thank you for a real keeper!
52262,55673,2006-11-19,4,A good and easy chicken recipe.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked for 20 minutes.  Next time I would check at 15 minutes since the chicken was a little overdone.
38643,55673,2006-12-15,5,This is one of our new favorites and a recipe that will be made often. Boneless chicken breasts work great in this recipe. The chicken turned out moist and we loved the balsamic vinegar.
33159,55673,2007-01-05,4,"This chicken was exceptionally moist!  Also, very quick to prepare.  We just found the taste to be a little bland."
180090,55673,2007-01-15,5,"Wonderful chicken! The flavor was great and the chicken came out very moist. I used 6 boneless skinless chicken breast halves and baked for about 28 minutes. This recipe is very quick and easy to make, I'll be making this again!"
54678,55673,2007-02-02,5,"Wonderful, quick & easy. I used boneless chicken breasts and cooked 20 minutes uncovered and 10 mins covered."
252816,55673,2007-04-04,4,"I made this for dinner this evening along with Crispie Baked Potatoes #106872 and Tarragon Carrots #88902 and Brownies #116597 for dessert.The chicken recipe was so easy and had a real nice flavor.The kitchen smelled wonderful as it was cooking...My DH liked it very much.The potatoes went in the oven ,30 minutes before the chicken was done,same temp400. I love these potatoes and this time I added half again more garlic salt and cayannne .The carrots had a overpowering flavor,but were a nice change.And who doesnt like brownies?I made half the recipe 5 bags.I made one for dessert and I cooked them at 350 for 30 minutes,they were cake like,nice texture,not as sweet or chocolatie as my regular recipe but still very good. I sprinkled powder sugar over the top of them..I will make other bags when I have unexpected or last minute company as I only need 30 minutes to have a nice warm batch of brownies..."
126104,55673,2007-08-19,3,"This had a little too much oregano for me.  I think the next time, I'll probably reduce the oregano to 1/2 tsp., and then it will be more to my taste.

It was very moist and juicy.  I used boneless chicken breasts, and I think that's probably what I'll do the next time also."
13483,55673,2007-09-25,5,This is company fare!!  Very good and very easy to do.  I cooked two breasts.  I put them in a dish in the early pm with the rest of the ingredients  then cooked them for dinner.  Well worth doing.  Thanks for the post Barb.
59163,55673,2008-04-28,0,"My DH actually made this as I was home later than him tonight.  The smell coming in the door was fabulous.  We really enjoyed this and it's so simple even my DH can make it.  I've been pushing him into learning to cook, this was just right for the beginner cook.  I praised him over and over, so he'll continue to venture into the kitchen! He-he!"
285039,55673,2008-05-16,5,"Excellent variation on a roasted chicken breast.  The skin turned out crispy, and the meat was tender and moist.  Wonderful flavor.  Definitely a keeper!"
847160,55673,2009-02-05,0,i love balsamic but this wasnt good at all
620763,55673,2009-05-05,5,"A great, quick and easy recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes."
250031,55673,2009-12-03,5,"Excellent, easy! I used boneless skinless breasts and a combination of a white balsamic and dark balsamic vinegar. I marinated the chicken breasts. I wanted to reduce the sauce but I didn't have enough to do so (maybe because I marinated). I cooked 30 minutes at 350. Next time, I'll double the sauce ingredients so I can reduce some on the stove to serve over the chicken. Served with Recipe #93179. Definitely will make again & again!"
177933,55673,2009-12-10,5,"We really enjoyed this.  I used bone in/skin on chicken.  It was moist and flavorful.  I actually baked mine at 375, meat side down for 30 minutes and then flipped it so the top would brown for 30 more minutes.  I broiled for a couple of minutes in the end.  I'd like to try  it with boneless skinless breasts next time.  Thanks!!"
371738,55673,2010-02-01,4,"Unbelievable!  My youngest son devoured this.  I split two chicken breasts in half (& lessened the seasonings), so my bake time was shortened. Fantastic & so easy to put together.  Thank you."
470351,55673,2010-06-08,4,"Very nice!  The sauce turned out very thin so next time I will try the saucepan method that others gave but the taste was very nice.  This was a simple, healthy meal.  My 4 year old loved it but my 6 year old did not.  DH and I thought it was very good.  Will make again!"
37779,55673,2012-01-11,4,"I made this using boneless skinless chicken breast. Love the balsamic vinegary flavor and seasoning was just right. Wasn't quite as moist as I would wish for, so think I will try next time with bone-in breast or thighs. A solid family pleasing dinner. Thanks, Barb."
140132,55673,2012-02-16,5,"I made this dish last night using chicken pieces.  My family enjoyed this and I will continue to make this.  I think next time (if using pieces) I will let the chicken roast for the first 20 minutes without the vinegar, then drain the grease from the skin, and then pour the vinegar on for a more stronger vinegar flavor.  Anyway, we loved it and will include this recipe in our rotation.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing with us."
928301,55673,2012-08-31,4,was good and easy.  Not great.
1179225,55673,2012-08-31,4,"This was a simple, flavorful way to bake chicken. Thanks for posting!"
218535,55673,2017-06-29,3,Too bland
8629,55673,2018-05-23,2,"I've recently discovered the deliciousness of balsamic vinegar and so I was excited to try this recipe. I used the ingredients as stated and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I started them out at 350 degrees for 11 minutes and then realized the recipe stated that the temperature should be at 400 degrees. So I bumped up the temperature. I kept an eye on them to make sure that I pulled them out as soon as they were done. Even with that, they came out dry and very unflavorful. I think the only way to save these is to cover them up with barbeque sauce. This recipe is not for me."
37868,17394,2002-09-04,5,Bev this meat loaf of so very good. Moist and did not fall apart. Great taste of BBQ that was not over powering. Mark loved it. We just could not get enough this on that I think we can double for a great sandwich. Thank You
39301,17394,2002-09-27,5,"With all the positive comments already given to this recipe, I expected a fabulous meatloaf and that's just what I got!  Thanks for posting this - it was tender and juicy without falling apart and very tasty - just perfect!  This one's a keeper!"
18391,17394,2003-04-28,5,"Great recipe! the only thing I changed was the sauce, because my husband dislikes sweet sauces over meatloaf .. it was very moist and flavorful, thanks Bev!"
64934,17394,2003-08-04,5,"Oh Bev... this is THE BEST!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  Very moist but didn't fall apart when cut, and a great barbeque taste to it!  This will definitely be a regular in our house.  Thank you so much for posting this super recipe!"
59473,17394,2003-11-05,5,This meatloaf was very tasty and sooo moist. I do have my own meatloaf recipe but I will certainly make this one again. I didn't change a thing. Thanks for posting.
43083,17394,2004-01-12,5,Made this for the Bev Cook-A-Thon and my family really enjoyed it! Just recently moved home so am responsible for dinner now. Thanks for a yummy meatloaf recipe! I didnt use all the sauce but it was quite tasty.
59780,17394,2004-03-25,5,"This was a great meatloaf! I made this during my once a month cooking blitz at the beginning of the month and I threw it into the freezer. The day before I wanted to serve it, I took it from the freezer and let it thaw overnight before baking. The only thing I changd was omitting the salt and we never missed it. I served this with crockpot mac and cheese recipe#81853 and supper was enjoyed by all. Thanks!"
73469,17394,2004-10-17,5,"This was the best tasting meatloaf. My husband always hates my meatloaf ,but he raved about this one. The meat was so tender and tasty. Thanks for a great recipe!"
60992,17394,2005-01-11,4,"The texture of this meatloaf was very nice. The flavor was somewhat bland however. And cooking in a loaf pan, (per directions) I could only use half the sauce. Perhaps next time I will use the seasoned sauce in the meatloaf instead of the plain tomato sauce to see if it gives it a little more ""umph""."
173579,17394,2005-08-11,5,This was a good meatloaf.  My DH really liked it.  Will make it again.  Thanks for sharing.
146486,17394,2005-11-29,5,This is the best meat loaf I have ever had.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and the flavor was awesome.  Thank you for a great recipe!
158086,17394,2008-04-01,5,This was a great meatloaf recipe...I did double the sauce and glad I did....
37779,17394,2006-07-30,5,"Bev, this meat loaf was very delicious. It was quite moist and held together well when sliced. The sauce was scrumptious and my husband used the leftovers to make an awesome sandwich. We are so glad you shared this recipe. Thanks. "
324621,17394,2006-09-25,3,"This was a pretty good recipe. I don't think I'll make it again, but it was worth trying once. I personally thought there was too much liquid still on top after baking, so I drained a lot of it off. I don't like my meat loaf to be too terribly wet."
68884,17394,2006-09-28,5,"An excellent, moist meatloaf. I followed the recipe exactly, except for a few spice exceptions. I reduced the brown sugar to just 1 Tbsp b/c I didn't want a strong sweetness, and I added some garlic and additional black pepper to the meat mixture. This held its shape very well, and reheated well the next day. I served it with salads, Southern Green Beans and Southern Living Baked Macaroni and Cheese. Comfort food!"
362983,17394,2007-03-20,3,"This was quick to put together, but was lacking in flavour for me. The flavour was just really subtle while I was expecting more. All of the liquid just stayed as a liquid, so there was just a pool at the bottom of the pan. Not too appealing! I did like the texture and it held together really well, but I'll probably use a different recipe next time."
64583,17394,2008-04-15,5,"This makes a great meatloaf.  I used lean ground turkey and it turned out very moist and flavorful.  I loved that it held it's shape when I put it on a serving platter.  Besides using ground turkey instead of beef, I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on top because I discovered I was completely out of brown sugar.  Thanks Bev!"
50969,17394,2007-06-08,5,"When I made this for my family on 06/05/07,I made a few slight changes to the recipe.Here they are,instead of using the plain tomato sauce I used one that had a blend of roasted garlic,oregano,and basil.Instead of putting it in a loaf pan I just free-formed it.And as for the topping,I made it this way,combining the rest of the sauce with 1/4 cup of water,all of the brown sugar,1 tablespoon of mustard,and the amount of worcherstershire sauce called for.And about 20 minute before it was done that's when I added the topping.I let it ""rest"" for about 10 minutes and it sliced beautifully.My DS and I really enjoyed this meatloaf quite a bit,as for my SO he doesn't like meatloaf,but he eats it anyway( go figure ;))As you had said your Recipe#30366 goes so well with this.Thank you for posting,this will be made again.

400420,17394,2008-06-03,4,"We really enjoyed this!  I've only tried making meatloaf once about 10 years ago and it was not a success.  Also, DH commented that he didn't like meatloaf, so I've been reluctant to try making it again.  But I was really in the mood and decided to try this recipe and it turned out great!  DH admitted that his mom added carrots and other weird stuff to hers, so that is why he never liked it.  But he liked this version!  The sauce was just a touch too sweet for my taste - maybe I'll try cutting back to just 2 tbsps of brown sugar, but I'll definitely make it again.  Served it with mashed potatoes and it was just what I was in the mood for.  Thank you!"
140132,17394,2008-06-11,5,"I made this a couple nights ago.  My family loved it and it was simple to put together.  I served this with recipe #11463, recipe #26441 and recipe #86228.  It made a delicious meal, very comforting and filling. Thanks.....Stephanie"
286851,17394,2008-09-01,4,"Moist and very flavorful meatloaf. Easy to make, thanks for sharing."
499050,17394,2008-12-29,5,Yum!
218535,17394,2009-01-21,3,This is good.
13483,17394,2009-04-23,5,A very simple and easy recipe to do.  Usually they are the best!!!  I think I'll use some BBQ sauce next time instead of the tomato sauce.  Be a bit more of a zing to it.  Good post again Bev
373817,17394,2009-12-09,5,Sooo yummy!!!
439797,17394,2009-12-28,5,I haven't made meatloaf in years.  This was really good.  Our boys really ate it up.
176615,17394,2010-03-21,4,Good meatloaf! I used a large loaf pan but should have used a baking dish or my meatloaf pan (with drain holes) as it was swimming in liquid. Next time I'd probably reduce the water. Taste was wonderful and the liquid kept the meatloaf nice and moist. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
128473,17394,2017-01-26,5,"Wow what a lovely meatloaf this recipe makes Bev. Moist, tender and delicious. Quick and easy to make with excellent results. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe, which we will enjoy again and again. Made for What's on the Menu? Tag Game."
182624,155021,2007-05-06,5,"These were really great!  Easy to make and tasted as good as fried.  Good and spicy, too!"
358796,155021,2007-12-30,5,"I have been told that these were the best wings ever! I doubled this recipe- but left the hot sauce/butter mixture the same. It coated the wings just fine without being too spicy. (Make sure to keep a lit on the pot while boiling or the red pepper can make you sneeze/irritate your eyes.) Broiling them makes the outside nice and crispy. These are not greasy or slimy, they are perfectly crispy and flavorful. Will be making these again! Definitely a must-try wing recipe for any party or anytime!"
250031,155021,2008-01-01,5,"5 stars! I achieved my goal! My daughters' boyfriends from Oklahoma love spicy food and anything they've ever tried here they have told me, ""nah, that's not hot..."" I made these for NY Eve and they said, ""yep, they're hot!""  Thank you, WhoDat, for helping this Pittsburgh girl deliver some heat! My husband also gave them 5 stars for taste & heat. I will definitely be making these again."
789516,155021,2009-05-16,5,"I'd have to agree with everyone else that these were delicious!  I used Frank's Red Hot sauce because in my opinion thats the only way to go, and butter, not margarine.  Perfect amount of spicyness.  Next time I'll definitely broil for the full 15 min. per side.
Thanks!"
347822,155021,2009-05-18,5,"Very good recipe.  I used Frank's Buffalo Wings hot sauce and butter instead of margarine.  I boiled the chicken, late morning and broiled them right before my guests arrived.  I served them with Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing #55514."
355637,155021,2009-09-13,5,"I told my husband that these were called ""unbelievable"" buffalo wings, and he replied ""OH, I'm a believer!"" I have made several types of wings, and these may be my favorite! Love how crispy they were and so easy to eat right off the bone."
1072593,155021,2009-10-28,5,"Lead me not into temptation because we all know that I have no control when it comes finger-lickin' good.  Oh, if it's at all possible I think I tweeked these to an even higher level of deliciousness.  I made the recipe as stated, but at the time of 'shaking 'em up' in the prepared sauce, I had the realization that it wasn't thick enough and ran off the wings.  I quickly returned the wings with sauce back into the oven for a few more minutes resulting in a perfect glazing effect.  Made for Alphabet Soup Tag."
632249,155021,2009-11-19,5,"I am rating this based on the method of boiling and broiling only.  The directions do not indicate whether the broiler should be set to ""high"" or ""low"" so I chose high and broiled for about 5 minutes per side. This worked out very well and the wings were crisp. I drained the grease off  part way through cooking as I had to turn the wings over anyways.  We do not like spicy foods so I just boiled in salted water and then followed with recipe #397659 which is a mild wing sauce.  Excellent wings!"
914720,155021,2010-01-18,5,"These were a great alternative to restaurant wings.  Because DS doesn't like things too spicy, I omitted the cayenne and red pepper flakes.  Broiled on high for 15 minutes on the first side, and ten minutes on the second.  Tossed in the sauce, and broiled for an additional 5 minutes.  (For DS, I mixed the hot sauce with some BBQ sauce - he said it was kind of sweet, and kind of spicy, but good.)  Next time, I'll do 3 pounds instead of 2.  Served with Recipe#193370 and steamed veggies as dinner.  Thanks for posting!"
74281,155021,2010-04-07,5,Oh my gosh these were great! I used full sized wings and the only change I made was to toss the wings in the sauce before I baked them. They had just the right amount of spice (I would call them mild) and even my 3-1/2 year old twin grandaughters loved them. Delicious!
316717,155021,2010-04-09,5,"i have to agree w/ everybody. this was a great, healthier way to make delicious, crispy wings. i didn't find it too spicy at all. so great for kids too. will make many times. thanks for sharing!"
928301,155021,2010-08-28,5,I always crave wing stop wings & have never been able to make any that would satisfy my cravings.  These did.  Very tasty!
68460,155021,2011-01-25,5,"Great recipe!  I love Buffalo wings but always feel guilty eating them, due to the fat content.  I felt much less guilty with these, though I was a bit unsure about boiling (boiling???) them.  I went ahead with it, followed the directions exactly and was thrilled with the results.  I served them with a killer blue cheese dressing and crisp celery sticks.  Wonderful!  Thanks WhoDat for this clever recipe."
371738,155021,2011-02-12,5,Flavorful without the fat of oil! A keeper.
362983,155021,2011-03-14,5,"Looks like this might be the 100th review!.. not that it needs yet another glowing review, but lets add one anyway because these wings are amazing! Fun to make and fun to eat; I broiled them in the toaster oven so I didn't even need to use the large oven. For the sauce, I mixed together hot sauce, chili garlic sauce to make it even more spicy, and a smokey bbq sauce just for a bit of depth. I tossed the wings in the sauce and broiled them for another 10-15 minutes, and they were perfect. The wings were so good, crisp on the outside and super tender inside. Definitely will be making my wings like this again! Thanks!"
1179225,155021,2011-06-01,5,"These wings are THE BEST! Loved, loved, loved them. We have found our wing recipe. Thanks so much for posting this great recipe!"
140132,155021,2011-09-04,5,"These were delicious.  I made them for our football party and everyone loved them.  I thought boiling them was a bit different, but it turned out perfect.  Thankyou so much for sharing your recipe with us."
383346,155021,2012-01-23,5,"It was my first time making chicken wings and it won't be the last one.  This is a great recipe.  I like that it's not fried.  Unfortunately, when I made them, I didn't know I had just a little bit of louisiana hot sauce left in the bottle.  But it was still spicy.  I omitted the salt.  Thanks WhoDat :)  Made for Best of 2011 tag game"
305531,155021,2012-01-30,5,"Great wings. Simple, easy, and delish. Thanks for sharing. Made for Cookbook Tag."
226863,155021,2012-02-05,5,"With a chef name WhoDat why did I wait so long to try this recipe?!  I should be slapped.  This will be my go to recipe for wings.  I found broiling on high at 15 minutes made my wings start to burn, so switched to low broil half way through. Otherwise followed the recipe.  I did throw in some bleu cheese dressing, celery and carrot sticks, but otherwise left this recipe alone!! Perfection!  My 2nd quarter wing recipe for Super Bowl 2012.  Thanks for sharing!"
13796,155021,2013-02-18,4,These were good... not great. Maybe I used the wrong wings. I didn't cut up fresh wings from the supermarket. I used the IQF (Individually quick frozen) Tyson wings from Sam's Club. They weren't cooked wings..   they were raw.  I defrosted them first and then made this recipe with them. They were a lot of work for the end result. A big pot to wash... a broil pan to wash...   bowl and tongs... sink to wash out after draining the boiled wings and spices.  I'm just not as thrilled with this recipe as much as others are.
482376,155021,2013-02-22,5,"Delicious! I make a very similar tasting recipe to this, but mine uses a lot more butter. That's why I'm putting this recipe into my best of the best file - it tastes like our favorite wing recipe but it uses much less butter! That's a winner in my book."
178742,155021,2013-02-27,5,"Loved the recipe. Came out alittle dry though. Next time I think I will do what another reviewer said, and bake my wings on 425 or maybe 500. Didn't have any red pepper flakes so omitted, and I used alittle less than a tbsp of cayenne pepper. I also seasoned with garlic powder and a cajun spice after boiling. I think next time I will leave cayenne pepper out. Posted picture also."
298447,155021,2013-03-12,0,"Because I am not a wing eater, I will give you my DH's take on this recipe.   He proclaimed this 5 stars all the way.  While he felt that the wings could have a little more kick in the spice department, it was certainly not a deal breaker (or a review star taker).  In his words, ""They are juicy and awesome and a definite DO AGAIN!""***  (**Must add that DH reviewed these after having warmed them up in the microwave the day after I baked them.  He never tried them fresh out of the oven--so I imagine that these are even more fantastic freshly prepared.)<br/><br/>Now, as a wing maker, I can tell you that this could not be easier to make and I found that the wings crisped up very nicely under the broiler.  The sauce was easy peasy to make as well. After it cooled down slightly from the microwave, I simply dumped the sauce and wings into a ziploc and shook to coat.  Thanks for a great go-to wing recipe."
176615,155021,2013-06-21,5,"Really good and very easy! I increased the recipe, used the individually frozen wings from Costco (unthawed), enough to fill my stock pot, then placed on a foil-lined sheet pan sprayed with oil, and broiled at 425 in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes on each side. Then just tossed in a bowl with Franks Buffalo Wings sauce. They were perfectly cooked. Next time I would make two sheet pans worth, these were gone in no time. Definitely better and better for you than purchased wings. I&#039;ll try BBQ and other wing sauces, too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
55729,155021,2013-09-01,0,"I am really not sure how to review this recipe. I didn&#039;t think that boiling was a good idea. After making these, I still don&#039;t think boiling is a good idea. I used frenched chicken drumsticks (&quot;lollipops&quot;) instead of wings. The boiling step brought out what my husband called a &quot;smell&quot; that  prevented him from eating. I think it brought the marrow out of the bones or something. I am not sure if this is specific to the cut of meat, so I am not assigning stars. It would be about a 2 otherwise. I used half of the spice listed and Recipe #287041 instead of the sauce. I also think the oven time after boiling was a bit excessive. I did broil for 15 minutes on each side, but had to move the oven rack down after the first 15 minutes. The meat wasn&#039;t tasty. It was a bit too tough on the outside and tasted boiled on the inside. The spices that I added to the water did come through, so maybe I just need to brine the wings instead of boiling them."
37868,51537,2003-01-24,5,This is the first Pie Crust I have ever tryed to to make. Very Easy!!! It turned out GREAT. I did not change nothing. Thank You
60992,51537,2003-05-17,5,This is too easy and too good to be true! It whipped together in no time and tastes great! Thanks LAURIE I now have no excuse when makimg a pie that needs 1 crust! I made it with Miss Annies Amish Rhubarb pie and it worked beautifully! The flavor is wonderful and the ingredients are all pantry staples. What a time saving spectacular recipe! Everyone try this...you will not regret it!
52543,51537,2004-10-21,4,"This isn't the ""best"" pastry I've made but its certainly the easiest! My main issue is that the no-roll method makes it difficult to maintain the thickness of the pastry. BUT, I'll definitely use it when I'm pressed for time or feeling lazy. Thanx Laurie! "
47907,51537,2005-04-28,5,I am a failure at making my own pie crust but this one worked!  I made a lemon meringue pie and prebaked the crust for 10 minutes at 400º and it worked perfectly!  So nice and flaky.  I now have a recipe for all of my berry and one crust pies!  Thank you so much for posting this keeper!!
137911,51537,2006-06-21,5,"I try to cut out transfats (crisco) in my cooking as much as I can by using oil or butter in place.  I liked this recipe because of that.  I was skeptical about pressing the crust into the pie pan, but it worked.  It held up fine when I cut the pie and tThe best part is that it tasted great!  Thanks for posting.  Pam"
64203,51537,2006-06-26,5,"I used this crust to make recipe #52356, Strawberry pie. It was so nice to have a homemade crust without all the rolling out mess! The crust was a bit too salty for our taste, so next time I'll reduce the salt a bit, but other than that it was perfect! Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!"
255338,51537,2006-11-12,5,"Thank you so much for this recipe. I have always thought that making pie crust is difficult and have therefore never dared to attempt making one, but with this recipe, I actually got to make pie!! Soooo easy, too. I only added 2tbsp of sugar because I wanted to use this crust to make Tarte a Bouillie (<a href=""/145389"">Tarte a Bouillie (French Custard Pie)</a>) which is a sweet custard. Love this crust and custard combo. Thank you again for posting."
176615,51537,2006-12-25,0,"This crust gets lots of points for using oil rather than shortening, lard, or butter. Texture is somewhere between flaky and crumbly, not at al tough like some other oil pastries I've sampled. Very easy, especialy since it's mixed in the pie plate. I found the crust too thick for my tastes, and would probably reduce the ingredients by about 25%. Would also reduce the salt. I prebaked the crust for a cream pie without any problems. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
180090,51537,2007-01-27,5,Great tasting pie crust that is very easy! Thanks!
373817,51537,2007-03-09,5,"WOW! This was so easy to make! I loved that I didn't not even have to dirty any bowls!!I made the recipe just as it is written, and it was wonderful! I'll definitely be making this again and again! Thanks!"
8688,51537,2007-06-03,5,"Oh I am so glad to have found this recipe!  This is a cinch to put together, and it is already in the pan.  I used this as a pre-baked pie shell for my Recipe #24591 and it worked beautifully well.  We were unable to eat the pie for 24 hours after it was prepared and the crust's crispiness held up to the task!  I will be making this again, Laurie!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!"
294000,51537,2007-07-22,5,You cannot mess this up!  It tastes fantastic.  Thank you for a great recipe I'll use over and over.
142367,51537,2007-09-06,5,I love it! It doesn't get much easier than this -- and it turned out yummy and flaky. I used it for a crumb topped apple pie.  I used olive oil and it worked great.  This is going into my keeper file.  Thank you.
318235,51537,2008-02-03,3,"This pie crust was very easy. I used it to make a pie from the leftover filling I had from my apple-pear turnnover recipe. I also used the advice of the previous chef and made some extra to create a crumble topping. I wasn't thrilled by the texture of the dough, I think that next time I would use a little less flour maybe. Mine was just too...doughy. Thank you very much though for giving me something new to try."
92816,51537,2008-03-01,3,This dough was too oily for my liking and it did not form a ball.It was more like breadcrumbs.I had to adjust the ingredients in order to make it into a dough.Once I fixed it up it was better but I would not use this recipe as it is.
93006,51537,2008-07-06,5,Where has this pie crust been all my life?  Could not be easier and came out perfect and flaky.  I think it took 20 minutes from start to finish!  Much cheaper than store-bought and so easy there's no reason not to make your own.
265954,51537,2008-08-09,4,"Easy to make. I thought the oil taste was a little overwhelming, but could easily be remedied by adding some vanilla or substituting with butter. I used this with the Granny's Banana Cream Pie recipe, and it was a hit with my family. Thanks for posting!"
37036,51537,2008-09-24,5,This crust was really good!  I must say I was skeptical at first because I've always rolled my pie crusts.  This crust had a great flavor and was flakey too.  I used this recipe for Recipe #100480 and we loved it.  Thanks Laurie for posting.  I will be using this recipe again!
529278,51537,2008-10-29,5,"This was the prettiest pie crust I've ever made.  It went together quickly and easily and had such little clean-up.  I did feel that it was a bit salty, even though I used a scant tsp.    In the future, we'll add more sugar for fruit pies, but it's fine as is for a pot pie."
111291,51537,2009-03-01,5,"Perfection! I made this using EVOO and it turned out great. Really easy too! Used it for an Old Fashioned Custard Pie - Recipe #260656. Thanks for posting a recipe that will become a ""regular"" in my house."
307214,51537,2009-10-11,5,Great recipe.  I have tried no roll recipes before and was not pleased with the results BUT this recipe is great.  I still prefer a tradition pie crust but if you are pressed for time then this works really well.
485151,51537,2009-10-25,4,This was great tasting pie crust- I used it to make chicken pot pie and turned out awesome.
439797,51537,2009-11-05,5,This is a really cool recipe.  I used it for pumpkin pie.  I did back the crust for about 10 minutes before putting in the filling.  So easy to make!
140132,51537,2009-12-27,5,I used the recipe for our pie for Christmas dinner.  It has great flavor and cut so wonderfully.  I made a buttermilk pie in this and will use it for other cream pies.  Thank yo for this easier then most pie crust.
91392,51537,2010-06-28,4,"Much better than I expected, will do it again with a sweet pie, I used it for a quiche and it gave a nicely crumbly result."
362983,51537,2010-10-14,5,"This crust definitely takes a bit of practice and some getting used to, but I love this recipe. It can take a bit of time to get the dough to fully come together; I find that it needs more milk and/or oil than called for, otherwise it's really crumbly and cracks easily if it's too dry. The texture of the dough seems weird when handling, but after baking, it's wonderful. I always cut down the amount of salt (and usually the sugar) because I find it too salty otherwise. I've used this crust for pot pies and pumpkin pies and it's pretty versatile. And no rolling! Love that! Thanks!"
371738,51537,2010-11-21,5,"This was a great crust for recipe # 101104.  I didn't find it too sweet, so I'll add a bit more sugar next time and perhaps some cinnamon when making pumpkin pie.  Thanks Laurie!"
383346,51537,2010-12-30,5,This is so easy to do.  And the taste is great.  Probably that next time I'll use only 1/2 tsp of salt.  It was a little bit too salty for our taste.  Thanks LAURIE :)  Made for Holiday tag game
810787,51537,2011-04-24,3,"This was definitely easy to make, and I paired it with a coconut cream pie.  I miss the butter flavor though..."
173579,51537,2011-04-28,5,This was so quick and easy.  Will use this a lot.  Thanks for posting.
203111,51537,2011-12-15,5,"I love this easy, no-fail pie crust and will not use any other.  Thank you for sharing the recipe."
928301,51537,2012-01-16,4,"mine needed much more time & it turned out that I needed to thin out and even out the areas abit more, but it was good and easy.  I chose it over a box mix because I would have had to half the box mix & I didn't want to deal with that mess.  I think I made a good decision overall."
315055,51537,2012-10-10,5,"I have made this several times and it always turns out great!  Thanks for a great ""no fail"" recipe!"
264017,51537,2012-12-25,5,"Laurie, you have restored my confidence in making pie crusts! For whatever reason, the darn things scare the flour out of me, but this was so easy it's impossible to mess up. I made the crust for a Dutch Apple Pie and it was perfect. Thank you!"
185926,51537,2013-11-10,5,"This is my best attempt at pie crust.  I&#039;ve always overworked them in the past...no more, this is a great recipe.  I mixed it until ingredients are just barely incorporated, then press into pie dish.  I also made another one for the top and refrigerate about an hour before rolling out.  However, very difficult to do the top as the mixture is so tender and falls apart easily.  Going to roll out and then cut into small leaves to just scatter over the top of my pie this time.  Thank you for a great pie crust."
103876,51537,2014-02-15,5,I needed a pie crust today for a coconut cream pie so decided to try this one.  It was very easy and tasted a lot like shortbread. I could taste the salt though so would cut that in half next time. Glad to know how to make this.  It will definitely come in handy.
1581225,51537,2017-05-07,5,"Turned out really well and was so easy! I do agree with other reviewers that you can cut down on the salt, which I will be doing next time, particularly with a sweet pie. I made an apple pie with this and it was fantastic!"
18391,8701,2002-02-12,5,"We don't eat pork, so I used the sauce on lamb chops and chicken breasts .. excellent recipe !! will make it in the crockpot next time .."
7108,8701,2002-02-16,5,"Great recipe, this was the first time I ever made ribs. I cooked them in the crockpot, on low for about 4 hours and on high for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours and they still came out very tender and juicy. This recipe is a keeper.
UPDATE: 2nd time I am rating this recipe with 5 stars.  Delicious!  This time around, I cooked the ribs in the crockpot on high for 7 1/2 hours, I bought ribs straight from the butcher counter, much more meatier.  And the ribs came out very tender and full of flavor."
13483,8701,2002-02-17,5,"Now I know why this is so popular.  These are simply terrific.  I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions:  slow cooked @ 325 for 3 hours and I did not use white sugar, I used 1/4 cup vinegar instead to cut down on some of the sweetness of the brown sugar and honey. Thank you Beverly."
29014,8701,2002-03-22,5,Beverly - THANKS for this recipe!  I always get stuck making my ribs (see Cola Ribs) for my DH - but I like yours way better than mine!
37305,8701,2002-04-18,4,"These turned out very good.  My whole family loved them.  I was a little confused about the ounces for the honey and BBQ sauce.  My jars were ounces by weight, not fluid ounces, and I was not sure what the recipe meant, so I assumed ounces by weight.  Maybe that is the reason that my sauce was not like a dry paste rub but a thinner sauce.  The only thing I left out was the Old Bay because I did not have it.  Also, I used 5 lbs. of spare ribs and I am not sure if these are the same kind the recipe calls for.  I cooked them at 325 for 2 hours and then put them under the broiler for 10 minutes.  My sauce was very thin, not sticky at all but....they were still good and I have about 2 cups of the sauce left which I am going to use to marinate london broil :)"
22015,8701,2002-06-08,5,I will use this sauce on many things.  I found that I only had about 1/2 the honey called for in the recipe so I substituted maple syrup for the rest.  The maple syrup gave it a wonderful flavor - everybody loved them.
60260,8701,2003-01-19,5,"I read through all the recipes before deciding to cook the ribs at 325 for 3 hours.  I made the sauce as is (measuring honey, BBQ by weight oz) and it was wonderful.  I also took the hint of cooking it on parchment paper and that made clean up a breeze.  VERY GOOD RIBS!!  My husband and kids don't care for eating off the bones so will try to make this next time with boneless ribs.  Can't wait to eat that sauce again!"
54678,8701,2003-04-02,5,Didn't have Old Bay Seasoning so looked up a copycat substitute. Ribs were magnificent!MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
32772,8701,2003-07-23,5,OUTSTANDING!! My 14 year old son made these for supper tonight. Followed the recipe exactly. There was enough sauce to make a large amount of ribs that I purchased at a food warehouse. He made it with Garden Vegetable Rice and a Vegetable Medley. He was so proud of his meal. The sauce would be great with other meat dishes. The sauce is thin after the one hour cooking but if you remove the foil at the end the sauce will thicken up a little. A new family favorite.
101034,8701,2004-03-28,5,"GREAT recipe. These ribs were falling off the bone tender and sooooo juicy. The flavor of the sauce was fantastic. I didn't use any white sugar, but added some cider vinegar, and tabasco. I cooked them in the oven for 3 hrs at 325,Iloved the way the sauce thickened up and clung to the ribs.
No leftovers here!!!! Thanks for a great recipe.

26512,8701,2004-06-13,5,"Excellent ribs! I was a bit confused with the description of the sauce, because mine didn't turn out dry, it was very wet with all that BBQ sauce and honey. I left out the celery salt and I added about 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some heat. I cooked at 350 for an hour and then reduced the heat to 300 for 2 hours and they were falling off the bone. The sauce was on the runny side, it wasn't what I was expecting, but it was still fantastic. Three of us ate the whole pan and LOVED it! Thanks for sharing, this recipe will be made often!"
169969,8701,2004-11-15,5,These were so easy to make and were awesome!!! They were gobbled up in seconds flat! I never attempted to make ribs because everyone made them seem so complicated. This dish is fabulous and you are right....It should be Illegal! I made them with Tommy Fries #22641 If there were more stars I would give more. I used real garlic instead of powder otherwise stuck to recipe! Thank you!
252816,8701,2005-11-21,5,"After reading reviews,I decided to omit the 1/4 cup sugar. I used half  jack daniels bbq sauce and half  famous daves,devil spit. I also used spare ribs,as they were on sale.I cooked them 325 for 3 hours.We found them to be very tasty and very tender,not overly sweet.Next time I will add all the sugar recipe asked for..Thank U for this wonderful recipe."
64203,8701,2006-01-01,5,"Delicious! There really isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said about these fantastic ribs. We usually do our ribs on the smoker, but it's been cold out and we wanted ribs, so we gave this tried and true recipe a try. Delicious, tender ribs that are full of flavor!"
229850,8701,2006-02-18,4,"Thought these were good. But setting in the juices and fat from cooking was kind of a turn off for me. I think they should have been maybe on a rack. Also the sauce didn't quite stick to them the way I like, which was surprising with the honey. I think because they were litterly swimming in the fat droppings. I followed the recipe exactly, but maybe should have put them under broiler for a couple of minutes. Thanx for posting."
358796,8701,2006-10-06,3,"Left out the white sugar and celery salt and used baby back ribs, cooking at 325 degrees for 2 hours & 40 minutes. While the meat was tender, it was not falling off the bone as much as I'd like. The meat was more like a tender pork chop texture. The appearance was nice, I took the foil off the last half hour so they could get a little brown. The sauce was really good, but a tad sweet for our tastes (even without the white sugar), so next time I may add something to spice it up. The honey is essential though, because I think it helps make the sauce gooey and sticky which is a really nice texture to have with ribs. Definitely not a watery sauce! It stuck to the meat like it should! "
39301,8701,2006-12-24,5,These were fantastic!.  I tried others' suggestions and baked at 325 for three hours and that was WAY too long - I rescued them after two and they were on the brink of burning.  Next time I'll just follow your directions.  (Which I should have done to start with!)  The whole family raved.  Thanks or sharing.
394077,8701,2007-01-11,5,"Very good sauce.  Sweet and spicy.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  A keeper.  However, could you clarify the honey amount.  Is it a 8oz liquid or a jar a that weight 8 oz.  I am asking because when I mixed everything as directed. It didn't came out as a semi dry rub; rather it was like BBQ sauce.  Thank you"
207176,8701,2007-02-05,5,"Nice taste!  I used country style, boneless ribs and marinated them in the sauce in a disposable tin, covered in foil.  I added the 1/4 cup of cider vinegar I had heard about from reviews, skipped the white sugar and used 1/4 of brown sugar.  I followed the rest of the ingredients in the recipe.  I baked them for 3 hours in the sauce at 300 degrees F. and then took them out of the sauce (it was thin) and put them on a broiler pan and browned/blackend them on the edges.  Everyone except my youngest who hates food, loved them.  I served them with my recipe#208422 and some plain green beans.  Thanks!"
347822,8701,2007-04-23,5,"AWESOME RIBS! I tweaked the recipe after I read a couple of the reviews.  I used 2 garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, I omitted the celery salt and the white sugar. Also, I used the original MC Masterpiece bbq sauce.  I prepared the sauce (mine was definitely not paste like)the night before to ensure the flavors blended overnight.  I bought 3 pounds of pork ribs, and smeared the sauce on both sides, put it in the oven for 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees covered.  Every hour I  baste the ribs and flip them over.  Once the 2 1/2 were up, I uncovered the ribs and baked them for 5 minutes.  The meat was so tender barely holding onto the bones. My guests loved the ribs, and so did I.  FYI - I had plenty of sauce left over. Thank you for the recipe."
55578,8701,2007-05-21,5,Great recipe!  Just wish it wasn't so figure friendly LOL!  I made homemade BBQ sauce and used Splenda instead of sugar.  This will be our 'treat' ribs and one for company. Thanks for the recipe.
125640,8701,2007-07-19,4,"I made these once as directed and a couple of times trying to get them a little spicier and not so sweet as originally they tasted too sweet for us and not spicy at all. This time I used Stubb's Mesquite BBQ sauce, cut back to 3/4 of the honey and 1/2 the sugar, and added an extra 1/2 tsp ancho chili powder, and it was better for us though not quite perfect yet. Thanks."
52262,8701,2007-08-12,5,"I couldn't stop exclaiming how good these ribs tasted!  I felt the flavors tingling on my tongue and my eyes were watering.  It was sooo good!  I made about 4 pounds of beef short ribs.  I used the same ingredient amounts listed.  I did not have a problem with the sweetness.  It was perfect.  I baked the ribs for 3 hours on 325 degrees stirring or turning every half hour.  I did end up with a lot of sauce left over, but I don't think I could have reduced the amount since the ribs needed the sauce for the cooking."
529278,8701,2007-08-15,4,"I don't care for ribs (not liking fat or meat on a bone), but my husband liked them quite a bit.  He said they had good flavor and will be his new rib recipe.  We baked them longer at a lower temperature, as some others suggested."
240552,8701,2007-09-04,5,Superb sauce!  I might just make up the sauce just to have around for other things!!  I didn't have as much time to cook as others - only 2 hours and cooked at 350. I would have liked them a little more tender so hopefully next time will have the 3 hours available or we may just grill them or use the crockpot. I also gave this recipe to my brother who is the king of bbqing and told him he HAD to try these!  Thank you so much!
184723,8701,2007-11-01,3,"After all the great reviews, I expected these to be heavenly!  When I made the rub... it wasn't really a rub, it was more like a sauce and didn't really stick to the ribs.  I followed this recipe exactly.  We did like these, though... and the kids ate them because of the sweet sauce, but they didn't have much of the BBQ taste I was after!  Also, I got a 4 lb. of back ribs and cut them apart before cooking and there was soooo much sauce left over.  If I was to make this again, I would cut the sauce recipe in half and just try to baste the ribs as they were cooking."
185285,8701,2007-12-07,5,"Yup. Perfect blend of Spicy-Sweet. And easy to make ahead of time and GENTLY reheat later. I cooked the ribs, popped them in the fridge and then re-sifted the sauce over the top and warmed them in a 250F oven for about 25 minutes before serving."
377581,8701,2008-01-01,4,This is good stuff! Quick and easy and tasted great. I left out the white sugar. It was still sweet enough with the brown sugar and honey. Thank you!
312577,8701,2008-02-07,5,I made these for my dad and bf. They absolutely loved them. I did add a tsp of liquid smoke. Great recipe. Update 2/7/08.  I made these again in the oven and they were SO AMAZING.  My BF has been eating them everynight!
38643,8701,2008-02-24,5,I don't know how I did it but I forgot to add the honey which is probably why we found the recipe a tad hot for our tastes but still excellent. I will definately make it again!.
140132,8701,2008-04-28,5,"If these were illegal, then take me to jail.....these are amazing!!!!  My family really liked these and I would love add this to my ""repeat recipes"".  I served these with crockpot scalloped potatoes and baked beans.  Thank you for posting....Stephanie"
98919,8701,2008-06-21,5,Very nice...everyone loved!  Thanks for sharing!
847160,8701,2008-07-13,4,really good but a little to much sugar ... next time im just gonna put half of the white sugar
218535,8701,2008-07-23,4,The sauce is wonderful. But the cooking time should be extended to at least 2 hours if you want meat that falls off the bone.
180090,8701,2008-07-31,5,"Wow...these are packed with so much yummy flavor, my taste buds were tingling! I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the white sugar as recommended by other reviewers. I'm glad I did because they were the perfect sweetness without it. I also baked for 3 hours at 325 and broiled for a couple minutes after. Sooo good. I'll be using this recipe again, especially if I have company over for dinner. Thanks for the recipe!!"
280271,8701,2008-10-01,5,"Loved, loved, loved these. Wow are these good. Thanks for posting."
74281,8701,2008-10-16,5,These are absolutely the best ribs I have ever had! I boiled my ribs first as others suggested (for 30 minuutes) otherwise followed the directions ALMOST to the T (no celery salt for us!). I used homemade Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and the entire family thought that I must have slaved in the kitchen all day. DELICIOUS!!!
969481,8701,2008-11-05,5,"Who needs a restaurant? I used bone in country style ribs and put these in the crock pot before I left for work this morning and after 8 hours on low, perfection! Meat fell off the bone and the sauce is incredible. We will be making these again. Thanks for sharing!"
499050,8701,2008-11-16,5,Yum.
226863,8701,2009-03-15,3,"My dogs give this 5 stars.  However, the human consumers did not.  I am a barbecue perfectionist, so maybe I am judging too harshly!  After reading all the great reviews, I thought that there was a chance I could get good ribs without using my charcoal grill.  It was raining today, so I decided to try this recipe out.  But the semi-dry paste was a liquid, not a paste.  I cooked more slowly as suggested by other reviewers.  I turned them every 30 minutes, to cook them evenly.  The ribs weren't tough, they just didn't have the delicious taste I get when I slow cook them on the grill.  I cooked at 325 for 2 hours, then lowered the temp to 300 for an hour.  They tasted slightly ""burnt"" but were they were tender.  They were ""wet"" from the sauce, but not moist....that is the only way I can describe them.  Not what we expect from our pork rib recipes.  My dogs will be very happy with the leftovers though!  I won't make the ribs again, but I may mix the sauce again for a change from my more vinegary sauce.  It is a nice ""sweet"" sauce...just not a rib recipe I would repeat."
937635,8701,2009-05-05,5,"Wow! Best ribs EVER according to hubby! I didn't have Old Bay, so I used Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning salute which seemed close. After reading the reviews, I cooked them for 2.5 hours at 325, but forgot to put the aluminum foil on until 30 minutes had passed. Still Awesome! The wonderful smells alone that filled our house made this a 5 star recipe!"
126440,8701,2009-07-18,4,I used this on 2 chicken breasts and baked in the oven for 1.5 hours which was too long for chicken. Good flavor on the sauce.
286851,8701,2010-02-27,5,"These were really good and not difficult to make. Made as directed. I think the Old Bay seasoning makes this a little different than most of the sauces you come across. Will make again, thanks for sharing.-- Updating my review---and changing from 4 to 5 stars---this is my husband's favorite, most-requested recipe. We make it often. Learning from another review, if I have time, I now cook them at 325 for about 3 hrs--and they are falling off the bone they are so tender. They also still work out fine if you only have the hour. Thank you again for this great rib recipe--it is the only one I make."
195589,8701,2010-04-08,5,"Simply great! I did not use the white sugar. I used tin foil in my pan, but next time would spray with PAM, as some of them still stuck to the pan. When I have more time, I will try the slo-cook method. Thanks for posting, Beverly."
1133190,8701,2010-04-11,0,"I'm not going to rate this recipe since I didn't follow the directions exactly. Unfortunately I would only be giving this 2 or 3 stars if I were to rate it.  All I did differently was to omit the white sugar - as suggested by another reviewer - and I substituted some spices for the Old Bay Seasoning as I couldn't find any at the store.  Our rib meat was kind of tough (which could have just been the meat I bought?) and while the sauce was very good, I'm not sure it was all that much better than regular BBQ sauce.  Since we aren't big rib eaters anyway, I'm not sure I'll try this again.  With the popularity of this recipe though I would recommend others try it.  Maybe I just messed something up?"
176615,8701,2010-05-16,5,"Fantastic! Used about 5 pounds of pork spareribs, kept all other ingredients the same. Used 8oz honey (by weight, not liquid measure), Hungarian paprika, and Paul Prudhomme's seafood seasoning (which is hopefully close enough to Old Bay). Grated the onion in the food processor and combined with all ingredients except BBQ sauce. Was afraid I messed it up since it was thin, and was hoping it wouldn't just run off into the pan. Poured the BBQ sauce on top. Used a nonstick roasting pan which worked perfectly. Baked at 325 degrees for four hours without taking a peek, and it came out of the oven absolutely perfect. Did broil the top for a few minutes to get more of a crust but would consider that optional. Excellent sauce, sweet but not too much so, great balance of flavors. Think I've only made ribs a few times, but this was definitely easy enough to do more often. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
199792,8701,2010-06-05,5,Excellent ribs recipe. They are sweet and spicy and oh so good! There were none left so I can honestly say everyone loved them. I baked them in the foil for 1 hour and then opened the foil up for about 20 - 30 minutes. Fall off the bone tender. This will be my go to recipe for ribs. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
255338,8701,2010-06-13,5,"This made my day. I am  sooo happy. When the sauce was ready, I let my son had a tiny taste of it, and he was so impatient to have the ribs baked so he can eat them. At first, I turned the oven on at 325 degrees and set the timer for 2 hours. Halfway thru baking, the ribs turned a beautiful caramel brown, shiny from the glaze. However, because I wanted to do it the way some reviewers did it, I then set the oven to 375 and baked it for a further 30 minutes. I would not do it this way next time for the ribs got slightly burnt. They were really delicious though, albeit somewhat dried out and blackened. I look forward to making them again the right way. Thank you for sharing."
189475,8701,2010-11-08,5,"This sauce was so good! Unfortunately I used cheap beef ribs and they weren't very good. Next time I think I'll use the sauce recipe to make something else, like maybe chicken in the crockpot. I'm sure the pork baby back ribs would have been way better but they were $6.29 a lb which is out of my price range. I'm definitely going to use the sauce recipe again though. I saved the leftover sauce from tonight's dinner and I'm going to find something to use it for tomorrow night"
316717,8701,2011-04-14,5,"Followed everything to the 'T' & it was a huge hit w/ the fam. Sweet, but not cloying. Perfect. Will make again!"
1122161,8701,2011-04-15,5,"Followed this recipe except I cooked at 325 for 3 hours, and didn't seperate all the ribs but cut them into four serving sizes. I turned them three times during cooking. They were so tender and delicious! Thanks for posting this amazing recipe!"
362983,8701,2011-05-20,5,Great flavour! I baked the ribs at 300 for about 2 and a half hours. Thanks for a tasty recipe!
620763,8701,2012-06-16,5,"Made these for Father's Day weekend and they came out great! Like others, I omitted the white sugar and since I did not have celery salt, used kosher salt instead. I baked mine for 2.5 hours on 300 degrees and basted every half hour. Delicious!"
128473,8701,2012-06-18,5,"My dh wanted ribs for Father's Day.  So I choose this recipe to try.  So glad that I did.  We really enjoyed the ribs prepared this way.  I baked them in the oven for 3 hours.  They were perfect, tender and fall apart delicious.  The sauce was to die for, sweet, hot and spircy..  Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe."
251626,8701,2012-07-05,5,These were probably the best ribs I've ever made. Fall off the bone good!!!
32058,8701,2012-07-06,5,"Been wanting to try this recipe out for yrs and finally i did for 4th of July.  Delicious!   I doubled the sauce because I had double the meat, but it was not neccesary.  I had way too much left over.  Next time I will only make 1 batch of the sauce for 6-7 pounds of ribs.   I finished these off on the grill (about 10 minutes) to get a grilled taste.  <br/><br/>I made the mistake and bought pork ribs, not baby back pork ribs and they were fatty.  Will definately make these again with baby back ribs."
168462,8701,2013-02-04,5,"As I did not have Old Bay seasoning or celery salt, I left them out, but otherwise made as written. My family loved them. Thanks for an easy dinner."
1581225,8701,2016-11-08,5,Very tasty ribs. The flavour was perfect! I'll be making these again.
844554,8701,2017-07-05,5,We inhaled these! It was me and hubby on July 4th. I left out all the sugar and old bay. I also baked at 325 for 3 hours. Next time I will salt the ribs first. I had never made ribs before and very glad I picked this one to try. Will not use anything else! Thanks so much for an awesome recipe.
39835,150987,2006-01-21,5,This fish is wonderful! We used catfish which was on the thick side so I cooked it a bit longer than indicated. We will be having this again soon! Thanks for sharing!
133174,150987,2006-03-14,5,"I agree with ellie, this is wonderful fish!  I used mahi mahi fillets and used a brush to coat both sides of the fish before dipping into the corn meal mixture.  The corn meal adhered nicely to the fish and produced a delicate crust.  Healthy ""fried"" fish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  "
13796,150987,2006-03-18,1,"I made this last night using catfish. We didn't like this at all. It looked good. The breading adhered nicely to the fish, but the taste and texture of the breading was not good at all. The thyme was overpowering in the herb mixture. We would up tossing the fish out even after trying to scrape all of the breading off. We were left with mashed potatoes, stewed tomatoes and a salad for dinner. "
68460,150987,2006-04-23,5,"Great recipe Mama!  I made this using tilapia and we all loved it, even the picky daughter.  I left out the salt since my husband is on a low sodium (and low fat) diet, which made this perfect for us.  I know I'll be using this recipe many times in our future.  Thanks so much for posting this Mama :)"
29782,150987,2006-05-30,5,"This is more than a 5* recipe in our opinion!
Its fabulous!!
I used cod fish and
I did sub the brown mustard with dijon mustard and a taste of brown sugar.(this is what I had on hand) and I spray my baking dish with Pam and I used 2Tbs. of butter and let it melt in my baking dish than added the fish and baked it 20 minutes at 375'.  DH and I both really enjoyed this recipe. Its a favorite that I will be making again and again. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe. "
9869,150987,2006-07-10,4,"Loved the spice mix in this tasty dish, my milk mixture was also very runny and will try the other suggestion about using yogurt or sour cream. I used Gurnard fillets.
Thanks for haring."
255338,150987,2006-07-30,4,"Fish were indeed crispy. My kids were split on the taste and texture. Next time, I will try using flour instead of cornmeal. Thank you for posting."
53932,150987,2006-10-13,5,This time I did it right and the results were great!  I cut down on the cayenne but otherwise followed the recipe using tilapia.  Great flavor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
92886,150987,2007-03-13,3,"This broiled up nice and crispy, but I thought that the spices were a little too much.  I think I would have cut back on all of them a bit."
46660,150987,2007-03-19,4,"I made this last night for dinner using some cod.  While my husband and I thought it was ok, my friend said it was some of the best fish she's ever had.

I think I made a mistake in following one of the reviewer's tips and lessening the seasonings...it had a major impact on the flavor of the crust and when I make it again I certainly won't skimp out on that. I'm sure if I had used all the seasonings it would have tasted a lot better.  Thanks for the recipe!"
180090,150987,2007-03-29,4,"This was a good coating for fish and it broiled up very quick! The breading had a good flavor and was crispy, but it was a little too dry for my taste. I think if I drizzled olive oil over the fish before baking it might have made the breading a little more moist. Thanks for the recipe!"
33159,150987,2007-06-01,5,"Just like it says, this was ""yummy crispy baked fish""!!  I love how much flavour it had without a whole bunch of fat.  And, I was so completely impressed with the way the breading stayed on the fish through cooking & eating.  Lots & lots of delicious flavour.  I used sole for myself; for my husband I used a boneless skinless chicken breast because he doesn't ""do"" fish - he really enjoyed it, too!"
227607,150987,2007-06-11,5,I loved this...Hubby did not like the fish I choose(basa) but the kids and I liked it fine.  Made for zwt
92816,150987,2007-08-28,5,This is a great way to serve fish.I used codfish and honey dijon mustard for the coating.I omitted the cayenne but added a little chili powder instead.Next time I make this I will use parchment paper in the bottom of the pan because it did stick quite a bit even with the spray.
140132,150987,2008-01-20,5,Delicious fish.  Iplan on serving this to my family when they come for their visit.  Thank you for a great fish recipe....Stephanie
285039,150987,2008-02-15,3,"It might have been the grade of fish I had on hand. (Frozen packaged tilapia fillets), but we found that the coating overpowered this delicate fish.  Overall, the process was simple and the texture was very good and I will definitely try this again with another type of fish like cod.  In addition, next time I might try to spray the top of the fish with a light amount of olive oil before I put it under the broiler; just for extra crispiness.  Served with the best tartar sauce recipe ""Recipe # 47077""."
331557,150987,2008-04-16,3,This was good although I think I would have to add yogurt in the future to get the milk a little thicker - it could be that I only have 1% on hand.  My boyfriend also found it a little bland (I followed the recipe exactly) so next time I make it I will have to probably double the spices (we are not subtle-flavour kind of people) as well.  I used cod for this and that may be why the flavours didn't come through?  I will definitely try and monkey around with it though as it is a good healthy base.  Thanks for posting!
248023,150987,2008-05-10,5,"Thank you for a delicious alternative to fried fish that really *tastes* good!  For my milk mixture, I used organic 2% milk, a little less than TBS of dijon and added in a little raw honey...  I let it thicken up for about 30 minutes...  I made the breading mixture as written and was happily surprised that this amount covered the whole lb of fish without any waste!  Since I was waiting for the rest of my meal to finish, I decided to bake them on an olive oil sprayed sheet pan at 375F for 20 minutes...  They turned out crispy and golden brown... but still moist and tender inside.  We liked the flavor the crust gave to this otherwise bland fish...  might add a little more cayenne next time...  Thanks for a keeper!!!"
55578,150987,2008-08-04,5,"Excellent!  My tilapia took longer than 8 min, but they were quite large.  They were very crispy and tasty."
486718,150987,2008-10-16,5,"Excellent!!  One of the best fish recipes I have gotten on here.  I used tilapia and made exactly as stated and it came out perfect.
Thanks!!!"
355637,150987,2009-02-16,4,This is really good - the coating is delish!
37779,150987,2009-05-21,5,"I have tried and posted many oven-fried type fish recipes and this one is the best of show. The coating was well seasoned. The fish was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Very closely resembles real fried fish. Thanks so much for posting."
47559,150987,2009-06-03,5,"Oh mama, this is yummy fish!  The coating was crispy and spicy without being fatty.  I served it with lemon to drizzle on top.  I'll make it again.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for ZWT5."
37449,150987,2009-06-05,5,Yum! I made this with red snapper and my DH and I both enjoyed it! Thanks! Made for ZWT 2009-Epicurean Queens!
226863,150987,2009-07-18,5,"Very good for baked ""fried"" fish!  To me, nothing beats fried fish, but this is a very good, healthy substitute.  I used creole mustard, but otherwise made it as directed.  My filets were a little thin....next time I'll try and make sure I have thicker filets so my breading doesn't overwhelm the fish.  I really enjoyed this...everyone should try it!  Made for All New Zaar Cookbook Tag."
768828,150987,2009-11-22,5,"This was very good.  I used the breading and milk mix on northerns and fried.  I know, not as healthy as baked, but don't think I could have gotten by with baked with my DH.  He really liked this.  He had gotten tired of fish as he and my brother went fishing a lot, so we had lots in the freezer.  He said he could eat more fish fixed this way.  Thanks so much for a great recipe."
350750,150987,2010-01-24,5,"Loved this fish.  It smelled really good when I flipped it and couldn't wait to try it.  I'll be cooking this often, thanks!"
632249,150987,2010-01-29,2,"Gosh, I am sorry for this low rating but we didn't like this at all. I followed the recipe, only reducing the cayenne pepper to 1/8 tsp as we don't like spicy, hot food.  Even though we like all the ingredients used, the spices were not a great combination for our tastes.  The coating did seem to stick okay until I flipped it, then most of it fell off.  I see that I am a minority with all the great reviews so I am glad that others enjoyed it. Thx for posting."
98919,150987,2011-02-09,5,"THIS WAS AWESOME and will change the way I eat fish!!  Not having any cornmeal, I subbed Pepperidge Farm Cornbread Stuffing and then just used a rolling pin to crush it.  I used 1 1/2 c. of this and then used the seasoning amounts called for in the recipe since the stuffing has it's own seasoning.  I only had flounder fillets on hand but think you need a better quality of fish for it to taste it's best.  I also sprayed the foil really well and had no problems with the breading falling off when I flipped them.  Thanks for sharing..this one is a keeper for sure!!"
482376,150987,2012-05-24,4,"We really liked this fish. The tilapia was nice and crisp on the outside and had great flavor. The only thing I will try differently next time is to sprtiz the top of the fish coating with Pam so it doesn't get too dry. Loved the flavor and it was nice and healthy, too! Thanks. :)  Made for the Healthy Choices tag game."
1052873,150987,2015-01-31,4,"The coating is wonderful - really sticks well. I didn&#039;t have any trouble turning it over. I ran out of cayenne, and it really needed it. We ended up needing some tartar sauce."
285039,129926,2008-07-20,5,This was a wonderful way to use leftover chicken.  It prepares and cooks up quickly and alongside spanish rice makes a terrific meal.  We loved the consistency of the sauce; but next time would add either a can of green enchilada sauce or another can of diced chilies.  We needed to kick up the spice just a bit.  Thanks for posting.
180090,129926,2006-01-03,5,"These were wonderful! They were easy to make, tasted great and were very creamy. Followed recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Thanks Deb!"
49304,129926,2006-06-26,5,"OMG Delicious,So easy to make, creamy and great flavor. I made them just like the recipe stated. These freeze very well. Thank you Deb for this tasty recipe!"
230557,129926,2006-12-08,3,"This was nice for a quick and easy dinner, but I guess my family is one of the few who didn't really care for it.  We thought it was kind of plain, with a strong sourcream taste.  The addition of some spices and tomatoes to the chicken to give it a little more flavor would be nice. Thank you for sharing the recipe."
191533,129926,2007-04-16,5,"Good, but I modified it for my convenience. I made a 9x9 pan for supper (6 tortillas) and froze a 9x6 pan (5 tortillas) for later. I used a batch of homemade cream soup instead of the white sauce, then added just 8 oz. of chicken broth. Added more flavor by liberally sprinkling cooked chicken mixture with cumin and chili powder. Turned out to be flavorful and just saucy enough."
248023,129926,2007-05-08,3,"A very easy recipe to put together for a quick meal.  I was drawn to the recipe because there was no canned cream soup in it...   My BF loves sour cream and I had some chicken breasts in the refrigerator that needed to be cooked up so this looked really good.  However, I thought there was something missing in the chicken filling.  To me, it was just kind of flat... I couldn't put my finger on it.  The sour cream sauce was good... but a bit rich for us.  All in all, we liked it but might try experimenting with spicing up the chicken filling a bit more next time.  Thanks for sharing!"
368078,129926,2007-07-31,5,"This was amazing!!  I surprised my DH with it and he loved it.  I found it very easy to make, and the only substitution I made was using olive oil instead of vegetable oil to cook the chicken.  Will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks Deb!"
74281,129926,2007-09-04,5,"All I can say about this recipe is WOW! I made it for a Mexican Themed Party and it was really easy to make. I doubled the recipe, used onion powder instead of onions, and used some pre-cooked shredded chicken I had frozen plus the diced chicken. I also used freshly roasted green chilies that I diced really finely. I had one LITTLE tiny problem.... I made it the morning of the party and put it in a disposable tin pan with a layer of foil between the pan and the plastic lid. When I got to the party and put it in the oven..... Well, I forgot to take the plastic lid off! It's great to know those things just melt down into a hard plastic square and don't burst into flames! Good thing there was a foil lining too or I might have ruined this FABULOUS dish that everyone loved!"
666723,129926,2008-01-15,2,"This was ok.  I definitely should have added some spices to both the chicken mixture, and the sour cream mixture... it was too bland for my taste!  I was also hoping for more of the green chili taste to come through.  Next time I will buy some green enchilada sauce and incorporate that into it.  DH and DSS said these were okay, but not like the green enchiladas I usually make."
55729,129926,2008-03-03,3,"We really enjoyed this and it was easy to put together. I did find the flavor to be a bit bland, but the rest of the family had no complaints. It is good that there was no cream soup! (Sometimes I try to limit such things.) I served it with a packaged green salad kit (Mexican/taco style, not sure of the name) which went well. Next time I might try using a ""regular"" chicken broth (I used Swanson's Natural Goodness, which is what I always buy, but it is lower sodium - might have contributed to my sense of ""blandness"")."
229524,129926,2008-04-19,5,My DH just raved about this dish.  It is so tasty :)  I did add a little cumin and chili powder as suggested by a couple of reviewers.  Also used a large can of green chile's. This will definitely go into our favorite recipe file.
147109,129926,2008-09-19,5,"This was so easy and delicious!!  I think next time I might add a little bit of spice to the chicken, or add green peppers. But overall it was wonderful, love the fact that there is no cream of anything in it!!!!"
426903,129926,2008-10-15,5,"If I could give this recipe a 10, I would. It was so tasty!! And, it was simple enough that my husband was  able to make it. (He doesn't cook very often.) We used grilled chicken strips and low fat sour cream. We loved that it had no soup for its ingredients. Thank you, thank you, thanks you. This will go in my personal favorites cookbook!"
140132,129926,2008-12-09,5,Five stars all the way.  We loved these and will make this dish many times over.  I served this with spanish rice and refried beans with tortilla chips.  Thank y ou for a simple chicken dish.
355637,129926,2009-04-16,3,This was a little bland for my tastes. May recommend adding some spices to both the chicken and the sauce.
64203,129926,2009-04-20,5,"This was such an easy and delicious dinner. I followed the recipe with a few exceptions. I added some Amazing Taste fajita seasoning to the chicken and onion mixture. I also eliminated the green chilies as I thought that would deter my kids from eating it. My 5 year old, who is the pickiest of us all, ate her entire enchilada plus a quarter of another one.
This was a huge hit! Thanks for sharing."
937635,129926,2009-05-05,5,"Awesome! After reading the other reviews, I sauteed the onions first in butter, then the chicken with an extra can of chilis, diced tomatoes, 1/2 frozen corn, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder (will add 3 tsp next time), 1 tsp garlic salt, and 1/2 tsp oregano. Delicious!!! Thank you, Deb!"
59163,129926,2009-05-05,5,"As I always do the first time I try a new recipe I follow it to a t! This was wonderful, made it for my son's 28th birthday.  I love the fact that there isn't any cream soup in it, I've made a chicken enchilda before with the soup and this is so much better.  I would probably add some chiles next time just to give it more heat.  I wasn't sure that everyone would have enjoyed that so made it just like it was.  Will be making this again for sure."
126440,129926,2009-07-05,5,"Very good enchiladas.  I made half a recipe and it was easy and soooo good.  I used leftover roasted chicken and just added it to the onion just to warm through.  Served with Quesadillas for an appetizer, Recipe #117892 and Recipe #303397."
486718,129926,2009-07-07,5,"Wow - these were yummy and very easy to make.  I did add some extra spices to the sauce but otherwise made no changes.
Thanks!!"
158086,129926,2009-08-26,5,These were the best enchiladas I have ever made.....they were a big hit with my family....I used some turkey meat that I had left over from dinner....worked wonderful....I will be making these alot...
140806,129926,2009-09-13,5,"Honestly, I didn't get to taste these because they were for a friend. However, she gave rave reviews. I poached the chicken earlier in the day with stock and garlic, added cumin, paprika and S&P, shredded it, and then threw it in the pan when the onions were done cooking. Assembly was a breeze. The roux was silky and beautiful, so smooth. Once I added the chilies, the house was filled with a wonderful aroma. I have told a couple of people about these and they practically drool over the description. Thanks for a great recipe!"
532289,129926,2009-12-27,5,I have never had sour cream enchiladas and these were delicious.   It's a very simple dish to prepare.  I'll be making it again.  Thanks for sharing.
350750,129926,2010-01-24,5,"My husband and I loved this dish. Loved that there was no cream soup and it was easy to put together, thank you!"
58836,129926,2010-02-14,4,Made for lunch today and it turned out really good.  I made  recipe# 169500 for the chicken.  Yummy.  I think next time I will put some of the sauce in with chicken so it will be a little moister.  A bit dry but very good anyway.  Thanks I'm sure I will make again...
810787,129926,2010-03-03,4,We really liked this. I added chipotle chili powder to the chicken while it was frying to give it some flavor.
485151,129926,2010-05-06,5,"These are wonderful & my family *loves* them. I make them using Taco Chicken (recipe 4957) I already have cooked.

When I make it I double the sauce portion and put some inside each of the enchiladas as well as completely covering them with it after they're in the pan. I absolutely love the sauce, so the more the better for us!

If I was making this just for us adults I'd also double the green chiles to give it just a little more of a kick.

Another tip is this recipe is very easy to double & freeze for a quick dinner. I like to assemble enough enchiladas for another pan and freeze them on a cookie sheet, when they're frozen I put them in a large freezer bag. When it's time for dinner- all I do is make the sauce to put on top and place it on top of the frozen enchiladas. I cover it with foil & cook it around 30 minutes. Then I remove the foil, add the cheese on top and cook another 15-20 minutes."
1179225,129926,2010-06-21,5,"Wow! Very rich, creamy and absolutley delicious! I layered mine and froze them. I baked them @ 400, covered with foil for about an hour and half. Turned out perfect! Thanks so much."
439797,129926,2010-12-21,5,"Delicious.  I added some leftover white rice and a can of beans, plus three diced cooked chicken breasts."
1133190,129926,2010-09-18,5,"Loved these! Better than any cream of chicken soup recipe I've made and just as easy!  I would recommend shredding the chicken over dicing it though.  I used less butter, maybe 2 Tbs and added a bit more chicken broth to compensate, you would never know!  Also I didn't have enough monterey jack cheese so I used a mixture of jack and sharp cheddar.  I only got about five enchiladas out of them though, maybe my tortillas were bigger then usual?  Thanks for posting!!"
232480,129926,2010-11-11,2,"Extraordinarily easy, but I'm sorry, we didn't like them at all.  Terribly bland.  I doubt we'll even finish the leftovers."
37779,129926,2011-01-17,5,"This was enjoyed by me and my family. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Threw in a couple cloves of garlic with the chicken and onion. Gave it a few good grindings of black pepper. For me, the sauce is what makes this so delicious. Very nice."
145352,129926,2011-01-18,5,Really good! I used corn tortillas instead of flour (personal preference) and they were good!
44383,129926,2011-01-26,5,"This has become one of my favorite meals. I've made it probably 5 times now and never changed one thing from the original recipe. (Well I might be a little more generous with the cheese, but that's all.) No changes or additions are required. It's very easy to put together and taste fabulous. Highly recommended."
222564,129926,2011-03-25,5,"Wow, very simple and very very good!"
176615,129926,2011-04-03,5,"Awesome! The family really enjoyed this! Easy to put together, and I love that it contains no creamed soups which always tasts a little off to me. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
879716,129926,2011-04-04,5,So good!  I think this has replaced our old creamy enchilada recipe.  I didn't have canned chilies so I chopped up some pickled jalapeno slices and it was perfect with just a hint of heat.
218535,129926,2011-04-11,4,Very good.
199020,129926,2011-08-30,5,"This was my first time making enchiladas, but it won't be the last! These were delicious! I added some green enchilada sauce and diced jalapenos to the sauce to spice it up a little. Thanks for sharing!"
456858,129926,2012-01-01,5,"OMG!!!!  SO GOOD!!!  In the past I wasn't huge on Mexican dishes, but since finding some great recipes (like this one) on this site, I am really beginning 2 think I may like Mexican. A short story here:  I wasn't ever much of a chef, but getting much better, again, thanks 2 this site. Just 2 prove my point, my idea of cooking was (notice past tense) popping a Stouffer's enchilada entree in the oven, one of my niece recommended (and she too is not a chef at all).  She said she tried the Stouffers enchilada with cheese sauce and didn't like it.  I had decided I would give this recipe a try, and then when I thoroughly read the directions I was a lil hesitant when I noticed the cheese sauce.  Well, let me tell U, I will NOT EVER buy Stouffers enchiladas again! Made exactly like recipe, no complaints, but may try adding some rice into the enchilada next time?  Or maybe just serving over rice?  This was easy and GREAT!   For someone who is watching there waistline, this was SO worth the calories!"
847160,129926,2012-06-15,5,"I replace the green pepper for jalapeno and it was great. Thanks for that good, eazy and fast recipe"
839492,129926,2012-09-21,5,"Awesome sauce!  Yes, I am a recipe tweaker, but hear my case...it was just what I was looking for, like a needle in a haystack...a recipe without creamed condensed soups. Well, I started with a recipe that did call for a creamed soup and came across this one for inspriation.  I cooked the chicken breasts in a crock pot with 3 stalks of celery and 1 whole, chopped onion, seasoned with pepper & Adobo garlic salt. I let that cook until done. Set the chicken aside, and took all the veggies, juice from crock pot & a can of chopped green chiles and pureed adding broth to that to equal the amount called for in the recipe. Made the roux...and the rest of the recipe as follows. Loved it. Kids all but licked their plates (unknowingly eating onions, celery and onions). Served with my black beans and rice. Thanks for saving me from a creamed soup compliation! We will definetly be making this one again. For the enchiladas I used onc side of the the dish pepperjack; the other 1/2 sharp cheddar (for the kids). YUM!"
39835,129926,2012-10-06,5,Delish! I used leftover chicken and light cheese and light sour cream. I also used whole wheat tortillas -- delish and easy to make these lighter changes. Thanks for sharing!
226863,129926,2013-06-23,5,"Loved it!  The only thing I added was fresh cilantro, and these were so good.  So easy to make too!  Thanks for sharing."
187373,129926,2013-07-08,5,"These were good, but next time would shred the chicken instead of cubing it. I sauteed it with some seasoning. Liked the sauce with the green chilies, but when making for us again, would add in extra for more spice. These went over well with us and our company. Makes quite a bit, will try putting some in the freezer."
969481,129926,2013-07-20,5,"As if this recipe needs another great review, but there is a reason there are so many. These were simply awesome.. The DS repeatedly said &quot;Honey, did I tell you how great dinner was&quot;.. Based on other reviews, I made only minor &quot;tweaks&quot;. Since our preference is to shred the chicken first, I used 2 large bone in split chicken breasts. Seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, Mexican oregano, salt and pepper. Roasted them in the over for an hour. I also made sure I used the pan drippings in the sauce. I sprinkled the leftover seasoning mix on the chicken after shredding. For the cheese in the filling, I crumbled queso fresco cheese, then used the cheddar / jack blend for the top (I mean really, why not have more cheese!). Other than that, I made as stated. Although next time I make these (and there will be a next time!) I wonder if I should add some black olives... hmmm.."
242484,129926,2014-03-09,5,These are the best enchiladas I&#039;ve ever made and my family agreed!!  Love that it doesn&#039;t use a canned soup and it is still quick to prepare!
400708,129926,2014-11-01,5,"Followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it.  A little different, in a good way; from the usual red or green enchiladas and couldn&#039;t have been any easier.  A mild, creamy sauce set the chicken of so well.  I think next time I might even add some cilantro and jalapenos just for a little kick to see how that works, but it&#039;s perfect just the way it is.  Had a lot left over (there&#039;s only two of us) and have frozen the rest for another meal, will be anxious to see how that works out"
91392,129926,2016-05-01,5,"Reminds me of a Chi chi's dish from the past. Good, rich, filling, changeable. Needed a bit more spice. A winner."
1581225,129926,2016-11-17,3,"I can't get canned chopped chillies here in Australia, so I used jarred jalape&ntilde;os and chopped them up. I only used about half the amount because I didn't want it to be too spicy for my kids but still have a little kick. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My kids didn't love it, they still found it a bit spicy, but they tried it at least. I enjoyed it, but I don't think it will be a regular meal for us. I have had nicer enchiladas made with a kit. I feel I can still give a star rating as I'm not adding or leaving out anything, but rather subbing something that shouldn't change the recipe much in my opinion."
269331,129926,2017-03-06,5,"I have made many times, with rave reviews! I used a rotisserie chicken. Perfect!!!!"
128473,87782,2004-03-31,5,"Thank you Evelyn for posting this wonderful recipe. It was so easy and the potatoes tasted so great.
We had them tonite and I will be making them again real soon. "
4470,87782,2004-04-26,5,You bet these are delicious! Loved them and they look great too.. my potatoes were a bit smaller so it only took one hour. Very easy to do recipe.  I got the potatoes ready earlier in the day and marinated them in the oil/water/lemon mixture. Thanks for a do again & again recipe Eveltn
101034,87782,2004-04-27,5,"Absolutely delectible!!! I also added some baby carrots and radishes. If you've never had roasted radishes, give it a try, they're awesome in this recipe. I served this with [recipe=33671]Whole Chicken Crock Pot Recipe[/recipe]and your [recipe=67949]Ev's Baked Feta[/recipe]. It was a great meal and all I had to do was walk in the kitchen occasionally to get some good smells!!! Thanks Ev for another great one."
28649,87782,2004-11-21,5,These potatoes were wonderful. They are very easy to make and the aroma is wonderful.  My son was saying that dinner smelled good before I even put these in the oven.  The flavors just compliment each other.  I cooked them at 325F along with a pork roast and cooked them for almost 2 hours.  Thanks Evelyn for such a simple but fantastic recipe.
37036,87782,2005-03-19,4,"These roasted potatoes were really good.  DH said they reminded him of the potoatoes his mother used to make when he was a child.  The only change I made was adding a little extra water to keep the potatoes from getting too crispy, as we like them soft.  Will make again.  "
68460,87782,2005-05-21,5,"Wonderful!  This gets 5 stars just for making my house smell so wonderful while they're cooking.  I made as written, using super fresh farmer's market white potatoes and one whole lemon.  I let them get very brown and crusty and we loved them.  I'm so impressed with the addition of water with the olive oil, I never thought of doing it that way....in the past, I just drizzled olive oil on the potatoes and got frustrated with how they stuck to the pan.  The water solves the problem and keeps the potatoes moist, but still crunchy and delicious.  I will definately be making this again, my daughter and husband loved them.  Thanks Ev, you're a genius :)"
119466,87782,2005-12-26,5,"I expected these potatoes to be fantastic--and I was absolutely right! We loved them, Evelyn. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
262312,87782,2006-10-22,5,"By far my new favorite potato recipe!  I went put everything together in a ziplock bag that morning and marinated all day.  The potatoes were crispy and delish!  DH even commented on how he loved the lemon in there, he thought it was a unique flavor!  I did add 1 boullion cube to the 1 cup of water, but didn't need to add any extra water, Recipe was perfect!  Definitley recommend using foil on baking sheet for easy clean up!"
64203,87782,2006-11-06,5,"With 71 reviews already, there isn't much I can add that hasn't already been said. These were wonderful and delicious potatoes! The flavor was incredible. I was hesitant about putting lemon juice on them... it just seemed like an odd flavor combination, but it works well together!
I had problems with the potatoes sticking to my pan, so I will probably stir them more often next time, like every 15 minutes or so.
Fantastic! Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe :)"
92886,87782,2006-12-16,5,"Terrific.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I did have trouble with the potatoes sticking to the pan, maybe I didn't add enough water during the roasting?  Would using parchment paper take away from the browning I wonder?"
89831,87782,2006-12-17,5,"Okay I'm adding my 5 stars to this, loved these taters Ev! :)"
140132,87782,2007-01-17,5,"Wonderful potato recipe.   I made these last night and my family couldn't get enough of them.  The oregano and olive oil combo with lemon was amazing.  Don't know why I never thought of putting those flavors with potatoes before, but am very glad I tried your recipe.  Thank you so much for an easy delicious recipe......Stephanie"
147109,87782,2007-01-17,5,"Wow, these were great!  I did have to add more water, but wow were they flavorful!! I will be using this over and over again!  Thanks!"
226863,87782,2007-01-24,5,"Great potatoes!  Simple and easy to make, and it frees you up to take care of other parts of the  meal while it is baking.  Thanks for the recipe."
400708,87782,2007-02-09,5,"Wonderful, and easy too.  I was looking for somethng differant to use up potatoes I had in the pantry and this fit the bill.  My DH is NOT a fried potatoe fan (can you believe that!!) but he raved over these.  So easy too and that was a plus.  They cooked while I got the rest of dinner ready so the cooking time was even a big plus.  Everything came out at the same time and was served hot.  I tried the adding a sweet potatoe to the mix (as another reviewer talked about) and that added just a little extra.  This is a keeper and will do again often.  Thanks for a great recipe."
461834,87782,2007-03-15,5,"Very good recipe and it was a nice change from the baked, fried or mashed potatoes.  My fourteen year old son ate half of the dish.  Will definitly make these again."
100526,87782,2007-03-27,5,"These potatoes were easy to prepare, tasted fantastic and made my home smell divine while they were in the oven. These will become a standard in my line up!

Thank you!"
74652,87782,2007-03-29,3,We really liked these and reminded me alot of the potatoes I used to have in a Greek restaurant I worked in... still I really didn't like the oregano and would leave it out.  Just a matter of personal preferance I guess. I served this with a Steak and Salad.
373817,87782,2007-06-18,5,"Very good!!! I halved the recipe, since there are only 3 of us. I loved the use of the lemon juice. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! These potatoes are delicious! Thanks!"
529278,87782,2014-06-20,5,We used a little bit extra garlic and chicken broth instead of water as some others suggested and it worked great.
125640,87782,2007-07-11,3,"Sorry. Nothing in particular was really wrong with this, but nobody in my house was excited about it either. Thanks anyway."
394077,87782,2007-07-12,5,Excellent potatoes and easy to do.  A keeper for sure.  I didn't have lemons so I sprinkle lemon pepper on top.  Delish!
218535,87782,2007-10-20,3,These are okay. I was expecting it to be amazing after reading the reviews. I must say I am disappointed.
111291,87782,2007-11-24,5,"This recipe does not need another review, but I just could not NOT give it another 5 stars!!  It is amazing that so few ingredients give potatoes such awesome flavor.  I used one chicken boullion cube and used less salt.  Otherwise made just as posted.  A bit of heaven on earth!  Thanks for sharing."
32058,87782,2008-01-02,5,"My son craves these!  I use alot less water than posted, but other than that this is righgt on.  Key is to stir often.   Thanks again Evelyn for a great recipe!"
189616,87782,2008-01-17,5,Fantastic! Like Bergy I prepared these earlier in the day. My DH had the leftovers for breakfast this a.m. along w/scrambled eggs and toast.
489552,87782,2008-02-01,5,"I am so behind on my reviews.  Please forgive me, but here I am. I have already made these potatoes twice!  Love the recipe and how easy it is.  It is now a regular in my home :)  Thank you so much for a wonderful tasty potatoe recipe."
185446,87782,2008-02-08,5,"Very tasty and very easy.  Thanks, Evelyn, for so many great recipes."
486718,87782,2008-03-15,5,Yummy!!! These were easy and smelled so good while cooking.  As stated don't by shy with garlice the more the better!  Thanks!
185926,87782,2008-03-25,5,"I followed the recipe to a T, did not add the 1/2 cup water midway through baking because I just did not know if it was needed.  I lined my pan with non-stick foil and I am glad I did.  The potatoes were sticking to the foil.  My whole family loved these potatoes.  They devoured them.  The three of them ate almost the whole pan, that's a lot of potatoes for one man skinny and two kids (6 and 9 yr old).  That's the greatest complement.  They all said 5 stars.  Thank you."
789516,87782,2008-05-18,5,great addition to any meal!
38643,87782,2008-05-26,0,"This was our first time having Greek Potatoes and although I'm sure they're wonderful, we just didn't like the oregano taste."
632249,87782,2008-05-30,5,"A HUGE thank you is sent with this review. I prepared these wonderful potatoes for a Medieval Feast for my daughter's class room.  The children just loved these potatoes and out of 40 children, I think at least half must have told me that they thought they were the best potatoes ever.  I prepared about 18bs of them and there was not one left!!  I found that the potatoes that turned out the best were done in glass pans or Pampered chef ware.  The ones that I cooked in metal pans lined with foil stuck to the foil terribly.  All that wonderful outer crust was stuck to foil. (Not to worry, I did not waste it, but picked at it later and nibbled on it myself.)  Therefore, I would not recommend using foil in the pan.  I have been wanting to try this recipe since joining Zaar and I am really glad I did as it is superior to my regular recipe.  So, 40 big thank yous for you today, plus one more for making me look so good!"
497077,87782,2008-05-30,5,"DELICIOUS! I halved recipe and did marinate the potatoes (a few hours) before baking. I was so pleasantly surprised at the flavors-will be making often! Thank you for a great recipe!!! UPDATE: Made again last night-marinated potatoes and fresh green beans that I parboiled 2 minutes. I cooked potatoes in foil pan on grill w/ the bouillion cube and last 12 minutes of cooking, I added the beans---potatoes and beans came out great!!! Kept the heat out of the house and easy clean-up! Served w/ Recipe #83189, Recipe #66596, and Recipe #30391-best meal ever!!!"
58836,87782,2008-08-20,5,"Don't really think you need another 5 star rating but here you go.  Made this for a staff potluck.  Was good but be sure you eat when hot, better that way. Thanks"
232480,87782,2008-09-04,5,"Excellent!  Super easy, too.  Great recipe!"
333017,87782,2008-10-21,5,"Ditto, ditto and ditto!!!  I cut these up early in the afternoon and let them marinate in the juice, turning ever so often!  I ended up adding more garlic (almost 1/4 cup).  I only had dried Oregano, but this still worked out very well.  The taste would be excpetional if fresh oregano was used.   Excellent recipe, Evelyn... we will definately do these again!!"
173579,87782,2008-10-23,5,These potatoes are great!  They are so crispy.  Will defiinately be making these again.  Thanks for posting.
847160,87782,2008-12-01,5,wow ...delicious
80998,87782,2009-01-05,5,"Simple, easy, and yummy.  A great side dish."
47907,87782,2009-01-13,5,"Loved them!!!!  Since there were only two of us at dinner, I made half the amount and they were delicious!  Very easy to make.  Thanks for posting another keeper!"
377039,87782,2009-04-14,4,"These were good, but didn't ""wow"" us. They weren't very flavorful. Maybe I should have added more salt."
126440,87782,2009-06-29,5,Good potatoes.  Just be sure to use the same size potatoes and cut the into the same size wedges.  Some of mine were burned and not good.  Served with Recipe #256734 and Recipe #66596.
242484,87782,2009-07-18,5,Everybody loved these!!!  I finished mine off with just a touch of melted butter!
199792,87782,2009-08-05,5,"Yes, indeed, these are very, very good. The inside is so soft and creamy contrasted to the crispy outside. I did add a bit more garlic as we love it. Thanks, Ev, for sharing this wonderful recipe."
13483,87782,2010-01-02,4,Great potato dish.  I did find the cooking was longer than necessary (maybe the spuds were cut too small??) and I did have a smoke alarm go off!!!! Must keep a better eye on them.  Tasted great though.
37779,87782,2010-01-03,5,"My family and I adore these potatoes. The flavors of lemon, garlic, and oregano are magic. Even with spraying the pan, some of the potatoes stuck. We just wrenched them loose and goobled them up. Would love to reduce the amount of oil, but I am sure the overall flavor would suffer. Will just have to swim a few more laps. Thanks evelyn, this one has found a home with us."
198154,87782,2010-01-13,3,"Smelled great while cooking.  They tasted ok but not nearly as good as they smell.  Maybe my lemon had more juice than a typical lemon, because I could really taste the lemon juice.  If I made them again I think that I would decrease the lemon and increase the garlic."
1133190,87782,2010-03-01,5,These were very good! The only downside in my opinion is the length of time it takes to bake.  If you have the time however these are worth it!
195589,87782,2010-05-10,5,"I have had this in my cookbook for SO long, and finally made it a few days ago! WOW, what great flavor! I put parchment paper on my cookie sheet, then sprayed with PAM. I also did like Bergy and got them ready a few hours ahead of time. Oh, and upped the garlic to about 6 cloves, we are such garlic fiends. LOL Oh, one more thing, I never peel my potatoes no matter what recipe I am using. Thanks so much for this recipe, Evelyn, going into my tried and true cookbook."
383346,87782,2010-06-12,5,Thanks Evelyn for a great recipe.  I love greek potatoes and it was the first time I made it.  I think I cut my wedges not enough large.  I'll know for next time.  They were crispy a lot but with great flavor.  I made half the recipe.  I used the juice of 1 lemon.  I didn't use pepper.  Made for the Zwizzle Chicks of ZWT
37449,87782,2010-06-23,5,So good! My son and I devoured these taters and wanted more! Thanks! Made for ZWT#6-Family Picks.
1269015,87782,2010-08-01,4,"Ours stuck to the pan really bad, not sure why -- made for more of a hash-brown side dish after I scraped 'em all off. Yummy anyway, and worked well with the one sweet potato I threw in (sweet potatoes are healthier, so we'll probably make them that way from now on). Great side, look forward to making it again and hopefully having them come out in one piece."
371738,87782,2010-10-10,5,"""Delicious-ness!"""
316717,87782,2011-01-06,0,"i really enjoyed this alot. it was full of flavor. love it! this will go into my favorites file. i forgot to spray the pan w/ cooking spray so i was nervous about it all sticking but luckily i used glassware and it was alot easier to clean compared to if i used a roasting pan of some sort. all i had to do was drench it w/ hot water for a couple minutes and the brown bits that stuck was easy to scrub away. next time i may try parchment paper at the bottom. LOVE parchment paper, i use it for everything if i'm in fear of anything sticking."
362983,87782,2011-04-22,5,Easy and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe :)
64642,87782,2011-06-04,5,"I have made these delicious spuds multiple times and we never get tired of them.  Didn't have lemons, so subbed lemon pepper for the juice."
236170,87782,2011-06-17,5,"I wanted a Greek side to make with homemade gyros - and these definitely hit the spot! My pan was a little messy, but it was worth it. Thanks!"
54678,87782,2011-12-31,5,Enjoyed these potatoes and easy to do!! Used extra garlic of course
93006,87782,2012-01-15,5,"Delish!  We gobbled them up.....thought the oven temp might be too high, cooking them that long, but it was spot on!"
188119,87782,2012-05-23,0,"It was great! I didn't get as good of a char on mine as in the picture, but maybe next time I will. Thank you!"
2549237,87782,2013-04-23,5,This recipe is excellent. I followed the recipe except that  I added in chopped carrots and they came out even better than the potatoes IMHO.  The carrots picked up the lemon flavor more.  I will definitely be using this recipe often.  Thanks evelyn/athens.
176615,87782,2013-08-11,5,"Wonderful! Loved the large wedges. Potatoes were nice and brown on the edges. Used my large Calphalon roasting pan which was perfect. Would suggest making more than you think you need, these kept disappearing from the pan even before dinner was served. Served with pork souvlaki, homemade pita, and tzatziki sauce. Will make again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
13796,87782,2013-08-28,5,Fantastic potatoes! The water makes all the difference in how these wedges crisp up nicely but still have a creamy interior. To think that all these years I&#039;ve been doing it wrong. I used to just oil and season my potato wedges and bake. No more of that. This is the only way I&#039;ll do oven roasted potatoes from now on.
307214,87782,2014-01-28,5,"Fabulous!  Only comment as people came back for thirds was &quot;they are kinda bland&quot;.  What??  Next time, I will add more garlic, and maybe try stock instead of water.  I didn&#039;t peel my potatoes, so it was a very easy recipe.  Served with roast pork but would compliment any entree.  Thanks for a keeper!"
103876,87782,2014-06-20,5,"Very good and flavorful. I made for our large family camping trip for our greek dinner.  I used small red potatoes, lots more garlic and chicken broth instead of water.  I think 1/2 the oil could have been used with great results. I lined the pan with foil, but wouldn&#039;t do that next time because the potatoes didn&#039;t stick, but the foil did."
142367,87782,2014-11-14,4,These are very good and super easy. I cut the recipe in half and it still turned out quite yummy.  Thank you for sharing!
43083,39835,2004-06-16,5,Thanks for a great meatloaf recipe:) Made this tonight with cheesy rice & corn. Loved the addition of Heinz 57! I also used seasoned bread crumbs.
9869,33671,2002-10-08,5,"Scrumptious! Spice mix gave a great colour to the chicken and the amount of cayenne just the right 'kick'. Ive noticed how white chicken meat becomes when cooked in a crock pot, very appealing.
Thanks for posting."
28649,33671,2002-11-10,5,The chicken was so moist.  My family ate almost the whole chicken~still have some for lunch to take to work.  The spices gave it just the right flavor.  Thank you for a great chicken recipe for the crockpot.
37036,33671,2003-01-21,5,"The spices gave the chicken a delicious flavor!  The chicken was very moist, in fact, I had a hard time pulling it out of the crockpot because it was falling apart.  However, the taste was wonderful.  We had leftovers, so my DH and I will be enjoying it again today as a chicken salad sandwich.  I'll be making this chicken recipe again!  "
8688,33671,2003-01-22,5,This is a deliciously moist and flavorful chicken recipe.  I don't think it could get any more tender than this! We enjoyed our supper so much this evening!  I prepared the rub the evening before and put the chicken in the refridgerator over night.  The house smelled heavenly all day while the chicken cooked in the crockpot.  I thickened the juices for gravy to serve over mashed potatoes as a side and served with egg twist rolls and a zucchini casserole side dish.  It just doesn't get any easier than this!  Thank you for posting this simply delicious recipe!  I will be making this one again!
68460,33671,2003-02-20,5,"This is a great recipe!  I made it exactly as written and it was very good.  I polled my family as to whether or not they thought it was a 'keeper' and my daughter wouldn't stop chewing to answer, she just quickly nodded her head.  Thanks for a great crock pot recipe!"
55578,33671,2003-07-19,5,"A very nice recipe.  I followed the recipe as written, only I cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hrs. I really liked the flavor."
50969,33671,2003-07-20,0,"kathy,i just wanted to revamp my review,i have made this twice.and i want to tell you again how much i enjoyed it,since there are only two of us there was so much left over and i was able to have 3 more meals out of this.thank you again"
60989,33671,2003-08-11,5,"This is incredible! I omitted the cayenne pepper because we don't care for the spice. But it was still so wonderful. Tasty, tender, literally falling off the bone, I made a great gravy with the juices and a little flour... I am floored at how good and easy this is. And being the first time I had bought a roasting chicken, I was shocked at how cheap they are! So much more affordable than the seperate parts. I am wiser! Thanks!!!!!"
4470,33671,2003-09-01,5,"Flavor filled, moist chicken with all the fat cooked out of it - excellent recipe.  The juice that cooked out is totally a jelly and will be put to good use as soup stock.  I used a large fryer and cooked it for 5 hours on low then turned to keep warm for another 1 1/2 hours.  For the last 1 1 /2 hours I added small whole onions to serve as one veggie, also served Garlic Mash Potatoes & steamed fresh green beans.  Wonderful meal.  To night I am have chicken Enchiladas and I know they will be very good filled with this tasty chicken - Thanks Kathydesrosiers"
64583,33671,2003-09-06,5,This is so good!  I used a chicken with a pop up timer and it popped up after 9 hours - I used the high setting for 2 hours and then turned it down to low for the remainder of the time.  I used the seasonings and measurements exactly as stated and it was so delicious!
35526,33671,2003-09-10,5,"My chicken was pretty small cause , well so is my crockpot.  Chicken had great flavor, couldnot have been easier to make.  Think the time might be a little long but followed directions exactly in that respect.  Leftovers made fantastic pot pie and another dish we will just call chicken surprise."
44383,33671,2003-10-10,4,"If I've learned nothing else about crockpot cooking (I use my crockpot at least twice a week), is that chicken is very unpredictable when done in a slow cooker. One second too long and it turns out terrible.  So I've sworn off chicken in the crockpot forever.  I've made this recipe twice, the first time it was great, this week it was terrible.  Just be careful of the time cooked, it will ruin it if it's done too long."
373817,33671,2007-05-23,5,Just adding yet another 5 stars!! This is a fantastic recipe and I will use it every time I make a whole chicken! Thanks!
37868,33671,2003-12-15,4,Can We Say KEEPER!!!!! I followed the recipe and my Chicken came out so very good. We are having it again tonight. It only took 4 1/2 hours to cook. I watched for the little timer to pop out. Great thank you very much for such a tender good tasting chicken.
95743,33671,2004-03-08,5,"Decided to remove the skin from the chicken first, then apply the rub and refrigerate overnight. A 5 pound hen finished on low in 5 hours.  A bit spicy for my taste but perfect for Dh and the juices made an outstanding gravy when thickened with cornstarch and served over mashed potatoes."
101034,33671,2004-04-27,5,"What a great recipe this is. Instead of putting a chopped onion in the bottom of the crock pot, I put a quartered lemon. I also put some lemon slices in the cavity of the chicken. Well, I'm telling you, the gravy is fantastic, it has such a nice lemony flavor. The chicken was moist and delicious. I only thickened a small amount of the juices to make gravy. There's so much left over that I  will use to make a great tasting lemon chicken soup. Thanks for a keeper, Kathy"
68960,33671,2004-05-17,5,This is fantastic and so very easy.  Loved the spice combination.  By cooking one of these on Friday you would have chicken for sandwiches all weekend.  Much cheaper than going out and buying a BBQ Chicken.  Thanks for posting.
76951,33671,2004-07-24,5,Very good!  I kinda steer away from chicken in the crockpot because my experience has always been that it comes out dry.  Not this one!  I used a Butterball chicken (which I feel is more flavorful) and placed chopped onion and about 10 cloves of garlic in the bottom.  Great recipe!
51011,33671,2005-06-12,5,"This is one of my ""fool-proof"" recipes that I make when I am in the mood for leftovers, or if I find a good sale on whole chickens.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe!!  Everyone always asks for it! Thanks for sharing."
229850,33671,2005-08-19,5,"If there was 10 stars I would give this 10. Absolutly fabulous. I made exacly as shown used 4 lb chicken, not roaster, in crock pot for 4hrs low then 3 high just because I came home, and decided to eat earlier. Fixed brown rice and turned drippings into gravy. I only skimmed fat. Poured gravy over rice. I had to stop myself from overindulging. As a weight watcher, I am very very grateful for this recipe, because I'm not a big fan of chicken, and it gets really hard to eat it all the time. Kathy I'm in your debt."
222055,33671,2006-01-22,5,"This was beautiful and tastes great! I let the spices only sit for an hour and I forgot to put my onion in, but neither mattered where taste is concerned. Talkin' about falling off the bone- it most certainly did...and moist! I mean moist! I almost added a tad of water to the bottom because I was going to bed when I put this on, and I'm so glad I didn't and followed Kathy's directions because I had liquid all the way to the top. I have high and low on my crockpot, so I put it on high for two hours and dh cut it down on low for me and then it cooked for about 8 more hours. I know that seems like a long time but the chicken was perfect and moist. I didn't plan to cook it that long but I was exhausted and couldn't get up. Main thing is- it didn't hurt it one bit. I used the pop up timer as suggested so I am posting a pic. I will be using this recipe with the same spices again! Well deserving of it's stars! Thank you Kathy!!!"
33159,33671,2006-01-31,4,"The method was perfect - 6 hours in my crockpot made the chicken very tender yet still juicy.  As for the flavour, we just found it to be too much onion.  We'll definitely do this again but with half the onion."
176615,33671,2006-04-26,5,"Wonderful! One of the best crockpot recipes around! Chicken is moist and tender with lots of flavor. I used 5 chicken breasts with bone and skin, rubbing some of the spice mixture under the skin before refrigerating overnight. Cooked in my 5 quart crockpot for about 5 hours but I think 4 would have been plenty. Used the time bake on my oven for some macaroni and cheese and had a lovely meal ready when we got home from baseball tonight. Thanks, Kathy, for sharing the recipe!!"
32772,33671,2006-06-30,5," Fabulous, Fabulous!! I followed the directions for prepartion as stated and wrapped the chicken in plastic wrap.  I  cooked it in my crockpot on Low for 10 hours. The chicken was Fabulous and the gravy was outstanding. I love cooking chicken in the crockpot because it remains juicy and tender. The meat just fell off the bone. This is a true keeper."
229524,33671,2006-08-26,5,"Finally a crockpot chicken that came out tender and moist.  I did cook the chicken breast side down, just wanted to try it that way.  The gravy was the prettiest color and the flavor of the gravy was the best we had ever tasted.  Great recipe!!"
89831,33671,2007-02-03,5,"Kathy, I finally got to make your fabulous crockpot chicken, well I can see why there are so many wonderful reviews on it, it bakes out SO tasty, moist and tender! I browned mine firstly on all sides before adding to the crockpot, I used a 7-pound roasting chicken and used all the spices that were stated in your recipe, I love this and plan on making it many more times, THANK YOU so much for an outstanding recipe!...Kittencal:)"
251917,33671,2007-05-21,5,Excellent!! This chicken was superb and the spice combo is incredible!!
124190,33671,2007-05-22,5,"Like this really needs another five-star review...but here I go anyway. This was so good. It was easy as can be. I did substitute a few seasonings, due to pantry restrictions. But this was so good. And now I have at least one more dinner's worth of chicken already done! And my critters got to have two or three days worth of treats too! (Not the bones. Just the stuff that doesn't look as pretty.) It was almost 90 degrees here today, and this was a great way not to heat up the house. Definitely making this one again. Thanks for posting!"
252816,33671,2007-05-29,4,I used a 3 1/2 pound fryer that I found in the bottom of my freezer. I used 3/4 of the spices and let it sit in the refrigerator 24 hours... Cooked on low it was done in 5 hours..I found this recipe to be very tender and moist..I did place it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp the skin..My DH loved the spicy skin on the chicken. I didnt care for the spices myself and removed the skin and liked the chicken much better than..I will cook chicken this way again but will try different spices..Maybe lemon pepper...I used leftover chicken  in #39681 anasazi chicken enchiladas..
520150,33671,2007-07-06,5,"This was very good & very easy!  Thank you very much for a lovely recipe, it will go in my book of favorites."
49304,33671,2007-07-10,5,We loved the flavor of the chicken. I cut back to 1 teaspoon on the salt also cut back a little on the paprika & cayenne pepper & added more garlic powder & placed it in resealable plastic bag overnight. Placed chicken on aluminum foil balls to cook in crock-pot. I like to cook it this way to keep it out of the juices. Chicken was very good & not dry. Thank you Kathy!
371738,33671,2007-08-10,5,"Excellent seasoning combination.  Very flavorful.  The meat fell off the bones.  I did not refrigerate overnight, but did season under the skin and added some garlic in the chicken cavity.  I also broiled it in the oven to crisp up the skin a bit.  very tasty.  Thanks."
187373,33671,2007-08-23,5,"First time to use the crockpot for chicken. Turned out perfectly...moist, flavorful. Definitely recommend. I was worried about the cooking time, but mine was great with about 8 hrs in a 6 qt. cooker. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!"
231054,33671,2007-10-06,5,"I didn't have time to do the overnight thing in the refrigerator -- and can't imagine this chicken being any better!!  I was making Chinese Chicken Salad and needed the cooked chicken meat.  This took 4 hours in my crockpot -- and when I took it out, the meat fell off the bone.  There was no wasted chicken meat here.  The chicken is very tender and very moist.  Instead of using the onion, I cut up a lemon and placed it in the cavity of the chicken.  This is very easy -- and results in really tasty chicken."
119466,33671,2007-10-14,5,"Great chicken, Kathy. It was moist and tender, and we loved the combination of spices in the rub. Thanks for posting!"
13483,33671,2007-10-31,5,Really not much one can add to what has been said.  Very easy recipe to do and very good too.  Two of us managed to polish off a small chicken at one sitting.
140132,33671,2007-11-03,5,"This is awesome!!!  I admit I printed this out quite some time ago, reluctant to try thinking that chicken would never roast right in the crockpot.  Well, I tried it and could kick myself for not trying it earlier!!!  LOL  This chicken has terrific flavor and the meat was so moist and good.  I have told all my friends about this recipe and that they had to try it.  We have done this a couple of time now and each time it turns out great....thank you for this easy to do recipe that tasted incredible.....Stephanie"
125640,33671,2007-12-11,5,"I didn't marinate overnight, still turned out delicious. Very moist and flavorful chicken. Also easy to prepare. Next time I do this method I want to try it with Cajun spices. Thanks for sharing. I will definately be making this one again."
359220,33671,2008-01-10,5,"Definitely one of those moments that changes the way you think about making dinner!  Just got a new 6 quart crockpot for Christmas and thought I'd try this out.  Night before, coated chicken, placed on bed of sliced onion and carrots, next morning set for 6 hours and was waiting for me on warm setting when I returned.  Perfectly cooked meat, skin wasn't too bad, but you could crisp under the broiler for a few if you really wanted to.  Soooo tender the chicken fell apart as I tried to remove it from the crock.  Drove my poor dog crazy to smell it!  Thanks Kathy for giving me the ability to make a nice roast chicken any old night of the week!"
218535,33671,2008-01-22,5,"Wonderful and easy. The meat was so tender, even my picky 4-year old ate it."
173314,33671,2008-06-29,0,delicious enjoyed with some baked broccoli casserole.... will make often.... thank you
248023,33671,2008-08-10,4,"This is truly a fall of the bone chicken recipe since I couldn't even lift it out of the crock pot in one piece!  I did not refrigerate overnight due to time constraints, but the chicken still had wonderful taste.  I cooked it on low for 4.5 hours and was really surprised at the amount of liquids released by the chicken...  it came up almost 1/2 way up my 4 qt crock pot... I placed the chicken breast side up, and they seemed a little dry or maybe the texture was just a little off...  the dark meat however was very juicy and tender.  We ate the dark quarters as our main dish but I will save the breast meat and shred it as an ingredient in a casserole or for chicken tacos...  I saved all the liquids, skimmed the fat and will either use it for soup or to use to cook rice for another meal...  thanks for posting!!!"
389431,33671,2008-09-03,5,"This was WONDERFUL!  My husband loved it! This was oh so easy and oh so yummy... it made the whole house smell wonderful!
I used the chicken broth in the bottom of the pot to make couscous... it was the perfect side dish for this chicken since it captured all the flavoring of the chicken...
thanks for such a simple yet amazing dish!"
355637,33671,2008-09-15,4,"Fall off the bone chicken! Love it! Very tasty, and so so easy!"
426903,33671,2008-09-21,5,"This was my first attempt at cooking a ""whole"" bird. I gave it a shot in preparation for making a turkey come this Thanksgiving. It was a little scary, but the chicken turned out fabulous. I only let the seasoning sit for a few hours prior to throwing it in the crock pot, but that did not seem to matter. I am looking forward to throwing the left over meat on a salad for lunch tomorrow. I can't wait, thanks for this tasty recipe!"
914720,33671,2008-09-25,5,"Wonderful!  I didn't have time to let it refrigerate overnight, but the flavor was wonderful as is.  It was very tender, unlike most of my roasted chicken.  I strained the broth, skimmed off the fat, and made gravy with cornstarch and water.  Served with mashed potatoes and lima beans.  Whole chickens were on a really good sale today, so I'll be using this recipe to cook the rest up to freeze for casseroles."
74281,33671,2008-10-02,5,275 reviews and no wonder! This is an easy way to make a a delicious chicken. I used it for Recipe #141578  which called for a store bought roasted chicken but instead I bought a whole chicken on sale for $3 and it turned out just as good as the $7 chicken the store roasts.  I used only about half of the dry ingredients but will use the rest the next time.
653438,33671,2008-10-31,5,"Made this yesterday for dinner and it was outstanding! We came home and the aroma was wonderful and the meat fell off the bone and was very juicy. I took the other reviews and put onion, celery, garlic cloves and lemon on the bottom of the crock pot and put onion, garlic and lemon inside the chicken. I can't say enough...thank you!
P.S.  I noticed that I forgot to put the stars on the recipe again.  Sorry and here they are...more if I could."
182624,33671,2008-11-04,5,"This recipe makes for some awesome chicken!  Love the spicy rub.  The only changes I made was to use a frozen bird, so I put the slow cooker on high for the first few hours then reduced to low.  I also used smoked paprika instead of regular.  Great recipe - thanks!"
632249,33671,2008-11-10,5,"Wow, this recipe is the bomb!  We absolutely loved it.  I reduced the salt to 3 tsp (as others noted it was salty) and I think next time I will go down to 2 1/2 tsp salt.  Also, reduced cayenne to 1/4 tsp as we don't like things hot. I tied the wings and legs so that it would be easier to get the chicken out of the crock pot.  The meat did not fall apart so tying it worked out well.  My crock pot didn't cook it in 5 hours so I cranked it up to high for one more hour.  Thx so much for this one Kathy."
847160,33671,2008-11-29,4,good and eazy
485151,33671,2009-01-21,5,"I couldn't believe how flavorful this chicken was! It was some of the most juicy & tender chicken we've ever had. It was hard getting it out of the crockpot because it was falling apart! I followed the directions, but didn't use cayenne or white pepper since I didn't have any. I did use 1 1/2 tsp of chicken seasoning instead. Oh- and a tip for those who've never made whole chickens with the skin on before- make sure to put seasonings on the meat, under the skin. So that way the meat will get seasoning & it's not all wasted on the skin that just gets taken off."
808027,33671,2009-01-25,5,Makes a flavorful and moist chicken.  My picky-eater kids loved this and it was so easy to do!  Great recipe...thanks for sharing it!
844554,33671,2009-07-06,5,"Yummy, yummy, yummy! Loved this chicken. I cooked for 5.5 hours in crockpot with aluminum foil balls on the bottom and chopped up onion. Also added less salt and added lemon pepper. This was very tasty. Thanks for a new chicken recipe."
666723,33671,2009-08-07,5,"I made this twice in one week!  I skipped the onions, didn't have any on hand but it was great anyways.  I also used my own mix of seasonings, I don't think anyone could mess this up.  My crockpot also runs high so it only took 4-5 hours each time.  After the chicken was done I strained the juices (made plenty of juices) and added a bit of water and flour and made EXCELLENT gravy both nights.  Served it over white rice with the chicken and this is a meal to die for.  DH ate two helpings each night and finished the leftovers the next day.  The gravy really takes it over the top."
140806,33671,2009-09-08,5,"Following the advice of The Surgeon Chef's review, DH added potatoes, carrots, and celery to the bottom of the crock pot along with the neck for flavor. Took 6 1/2 hours with about a 4 lb chicken. So easy and the results will not disappoint! DH said the meat was falling of the bone. He recommends placing the breast side down to retain as much moisture as possible. Thanks for a great recipe!"
37779,33671,2009-10-13,5,"This has all been said before--easy, delicious, super tender meat, great seasoning. My bird was done in 5 hours. Will use this recipe many times over. Thanks."
394077,33671,2009-10-19,5,Very easy to do and tastes great.  The only change I would do is to reduce the salt to 2-3 teaspoon.  I used 4 teaspoons on a huge chicken and it was on the salty side.
350750,33671,2009-11-21,5,"Love how simple this is, it's also tasty. Thanks for a great main dish!"
88099,33671,2010-01-10,5,This is one of the best Whole Chicken recipes I've made in a long time.  The flavor was just outstanding.  I made this in my dutch oven and baked it for 5 hours at 250 as another reviewer suggested and it was falling off the bone tender and moist.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.  :)
298447,33671,2010-01-29,5,"Another satisfied customer rating!  I've made this several times and with rave reviews from my tribe.  As such, I wonder why I haven't taken the time to rate this before .   The first night, we usually have the chicken with veggies and such, and the next day, I usually pick thru the chicken and reserve any leftover juice/gravy to make chicken & rice.  If anything else remains, I will usually use it up by making homemade broth with it.  Thanks for such an easy, delicious and versatile, budget-stretching recipe!"
1133190,33671,2010-03-04,5,Until last night I had never roasted a whole chicken before.  But this was very easy and didn't even take that long (about 4 1/2 hours).  The flavor was great and the chicken was very moist and tender.
1506604,33671,2010-06-03,5,"Very good. Had to add some seasonings because it was kind of bland but the meal didn't suffer at all, I just sprinkled and flipped it twice and let it cook. Cooked in two hours, wish i threw in potatoes also but the onions were great."
482376,33671,2011-05-14,5,This is probably the best crock pot recipe I've ever tried using a whole chicken. It worked perfectly. The flavor is wonderful. I loved the hint of spice. The chicken is very moist. Straight into my best of the best file it goes. Thank you!
145352,33671,2011-06-27,5,"Lovely!! I used this for the meat, and ended up using the broth too!!! Fantastic. A keeper."
368078,33671,2011-10-28,5,"perfect!  We rubbed the herbs on the chicken right before cooking in the crockpot and it came out flavorful and tender.  We put carrots in the crockpot as well, and they were so yummy (with the taste of the herbs) that we will add more veggies next time!"
839492,33671,2012-01-30,5,"The flavor was excellent, and so easy to put together. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and they fell apart to almost a pulled chicken consistency.  I did end up adding some water as it seemed to be cooking really dry (most likely due to using breasts only). I took half of what I cooked, cooled it and mixed with mayo, celery and chopped onion to make chicken salad for lunch the next day. So flavorful. I would definitely not use more than 2t. of salt, it was plenty salty with just that amount, I would consider reducing the salt more if I made it again. Thanks for sharing!"
55729,33671,2012-02-04,3,"Not bad, but the white meat turned out dry rather than tender. Very easy. I found it a bit spicy, but would probably not reduce the spice because I did like it."
64642,33671,2012-03-05,3,"I guess I need to admit I'm not wild about crockpot chicken, although I tried this recipe with high hopes based upon the other reviews.  Followed the directions precisely and did end up with a falling-off-the-bones bird, but the meat turned out stringy and a little bit flavorless.  The bright side is that I ended up with some terrific broth to make soup with the next day.  :-)"
369715,33671,2012-03-12,4,This was good and easy to make. I put my chicken on a bed of onions and used the fajita seasoning as you stated in the notes. It was easy to put together in the morning. Mine cooked up in four hours.
789516,33671,2012-04-21,5,"I was skeptical, but it was great!  Started it off in my crock pot, cooked it for about 4-5 hours, then put it in my oven to brown it.  Since my oven has a built in thermometer I used that to gauge how cooked it was.  After it was browned, I put in a dish, covered with tin foil and transfered to my lower oven to keep warm a couple of hours."
333017,33671,2012-07-10,5,"I loved this recipe for the simplicity of it!  I had a small roaster that I had taken out of the freezer last night.  It was still partially frozen when I put it in the crock pot this morning and cooked it on low for about 6 hours.  Since the weather has changed and it got hot, I will serve the meat cold with some pasta salads.  The meat turned out nice and tender.   I would definately do this one again!  Thanks for the posting!"
1072593,33671,2015-03-25,5,"Come on over, I&#039;ve got a chicken just coming out of the crockpot. I&#039;m just itching to have someone over for dinner. We can party? Yes??"
185926,33671,2013-03-20,4,"Easy and fast.  However, it&#039;s very similar to the Costco chickens and that&#039; even easier."
8629,33671,2013-04-14,4,My 4.5 lb. chicken cooked in about 5.5 hours.  The rub imparted a good flavor to the meat.
489552,33671,2013-10-17,5,I can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t rated this recipe.  I have made this a dozen times and always always turns out perfect.  This is my youngest daughters favorite crock pot chicken.
1052873,33671,2014-02-09,5,Good with domestic rabbit. Added spices to 1/4 olive oil and rub on skinless meat. Done in 7 hours on low.
1581225,33671,2014-10-20,4,A nice way to cook a whole chicken. Tender and flavourful. I still prefer the oven for a whole chicken though.
168462,146427,2005-12-31,5,Very easy appetizer. I made these up in the morning and put them in a container for later in the day. When it was time to make them I simply added the brown sugar and chili(mixed together) to the container and shook. These disappeared fast. I would recommend putting an absorbant towel underneath when serving as there was a bit of grease on the plate. Next time I might use a rack when cooking these in the oven in order to  allow the grease to fall off. These were very easy and fast to prepare and can be made ahead. Thanks for the great recipe.
173314,146427,2006-01-18,4,I liked flavor and concept of these and will try again....bacon was not as crisp as I would like and need  to perfect this recipe a bit.  thanks for a good idea.
316717,146427,2007-01-14,3,i found this to be really bland. i was expecting lots of flavor due to bacon and brown sugar ingredients...but i was disappointed. sorry...maybe next time if there is a next time..i'll add lots of salt or make a dipping sauce.
29782,146427,2007-02-05,4,"One of our friends brought this to our Superbowl party and everyone enjoyed them. I told her I would post a review for her. Everyone said that these had a nice flavor to them. Went fast!
Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
185926,146427,2007-04-22,4,"I made this for a ladies get together.  The ladies loved them.  I did marinate the chicken breast cubes for about 2 hours as per some of the other comments. I made a marinate of soy sauce, olive oil, fresh ground black peppers, paprarika, hoisin sause, and oyster sauce.  I also baked it for an additional 15 minutes to get the bacon crispy.  I lined the bottom of my broiler pan with parchment paper (thank goodness because there was a smoky mess in there).  I also added 1/2 teaspon of cayenne pepper powder to the brown sugar mixture to spice it up.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because my family, who love bacon, did not like these as much.  They were non-commital about the dish."
8629,146427,2007-05-27,5,"I love these!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs but otherwise followed the instructions.  I put them on the long skewers like Quest4ZBest's picture shows.  Great, great flavor.  Be sure to heed the instruction to coat the rack and broiler pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Clean up is a little messy but more than worth it."
103876,146427,2007-06-03,5,These little appetizers were great!  I made them for a cookout last night and everyone liked them.  They were easy to make ahead too.  I just rolled them in the brown sugar/chili powder mixture when I was ready to bake.  I'm sure I will make these again.  Thanks for posting.
240552,146427,2007-08-16,5,These were gobbled up. I used turkey bacon instead of regular. We ate them as our main dish.  Thank you so much!
135887,146427,2009-02-15,4,I mixed the brown sugar and chili powder in a zip lock bag and added 1/4 tsp cayenne (next time I will add a tad more cayenne) and just tossed the chicken bacon skewers in.  I put a wire rack into a foil lined jelly roll sprayed with non-stick spray.  I had to bake these about 50 minutes and turned them over so they would be equally crispy.  Easy to make and yummy!
286851,146427,2008-01-04,5,"I've made this also, with great success; however, I used 1-1/2 lbs. chix breasts and 3/4 cups brown sugar. Yummy, yummy. Also good cold from the frig the next day. Thanks for sharing."
185446,146427,2008-01-25,5,"I don't like to tamper with original recipes, but I did add 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper to this as another reviewer suggested.  Loved it.  Thanks for yet another great recipe, Sharlene."
632249,146427,2008-01-25,4,I am the only one that wasn't thrilled with these.  I thought they were okay but everyone else seemed to think they were great.  We dipped them in BBQ sauce. Thx for posting.
357358,146427,2008-06-29,5,"All six family members gave these high praise. I plan on making these again for a dinner by using boneless, skinless thighs and wrapping them with a whole slice of Paula Deen's Pepper Bacon to reduce prep time (it took me a lot longer than 10 minutes to cut the chicken breasts up). Oh, by the way... double this recipe or you will have kids fighting in the kitchen over the leftovers! ;)"
520150,146427,2008-07-09,5,"I made these for a group of friends.  Wonderful!  I liked that I could prep them ahead of time & just pop them in the oven before everyone showed up.  I will keep this recipe handy, thank you very much for sharing."
218535,146427,2008-08-01,5,This is VERY yummy. But I seem to have too much sugar left over.
140132,146427,2009-03-03,5,"Fabulous!!!  We loved these so much my DS asked me to make them for dinner some evening.  I really liked the flavor of the bacon with the sugar and chili powder.....yummy.  Thank you for posting a new ""regular"" for us on game days."
227607,146427,2009-06-12,5,"MMMM, these were good!  I realized I did not have any toothpicks and it worked fine just having the ends of the bacon on the bottom when cooking.  The bacon did not fall off at all.  My husband wants me to baste them a little towards the end of cooking with a little brown sugar and water or butter mixture.  He thought the chili powder was a little too strong."
195589,146427,2009-06-12,5,"Yummmmm, these are delish! I have made them 4 times now. I cook mine for an extra 10 minutes. I sometimes make the rolls ahead of time,and then roll in the sugar mix right before putting in the oven. Also, I use foil on my pan so there is no mess to clean up. We have even grilled them on foil on the Weber, I think they are even more flavorful that way. They freeze well, after they are grilled and then cooled. Thanks for posting, Sharlene."
74281,146427,2009-07-17,5,"Delicious and easy. Used a gallon sized freezer bag and made the chicken ahead of time then just tossed in the brown sugar-chili powder mix and shook them all up. I cooked mine for 45 minutes to make the bacon crispier. Also lined my pan with foil to make clean-up easier and turned the chicken over once half-way throught cooking. I served this as a main dish with corn, cheesy potatoes and garlic bread and it was a huge hit! A big test for me is how well my 2-1/2 year old twin granddaughters like things and they loved this dish!"
407007,146427,2009-12-24,5,"These are beautiful and yummy. I made this as an appetizer for our Christmas Eve dinner. I left out the brown sugar, and really didn't miss it. I too cooked them about 40 minutes total. DH loved them and was using them as dippers for our fondue, lol. :) Thanks so much for sharing!"
353131,146427,2010-01-02,5,"These were out of this world! I didn't have toothpicks but I did have skewers. So, we threaded them on the skewers and adjusted cooking time. I had a little leftover brown sugar mixture so I rubbed on the chicken again about half-way through cooking time. We found that these needed a little salt but other than that they were great!"
355637,146427,2010-01-12,4,Very tasty!
54678,146427,2010-06-11,5,"DD needed a recipe for a basketball windup and I found her the recipe but of course she had no time to make it so I followed the advise of rolling the chicken first in the spice mixture then wrapping in the bacon. This left a sweet and spicy liquid mixture to baste on them. I used only 1 tbsp chili powder but added the 1/2 tsp cayenne and also seasoned with fresh ground black pepper after I wrapped. I also flipped them halfway through cooking (total time 45 mins) I did some on the broiler and should have made sure to also put the foil on bottom part not just the upper pan (thats okay, DD will be doing the cleanup!!) I also had too many to fit on the broiler pan so I used a small pan that I lined with foil. This produced a blackened foil but a nice carmelization on the bacon (as long as you catch it early enough so the burnt smell does not permeate the wraps) Will try this again using some of the other suggestions of variation on spices. She will have to reheat so hoping they are as good as fresh out of the oven....my reward for doing the cooking!!"
176615,146427,2010-07-28,5,"Great recipe! This is one I definitely need to remember. Easy and fast to put together. Makes a great appetizer, but my family would have been happy to eat it as a main dish. I thought the chicken was best when cut into smaller pieces than indicated. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
377039,146427,2010-08-17,5,"Really good. I don't have a rack, but I poured off the grease halfway through. There was way more sugar/chili mixture than needed; I did add an extra tablespoon of chili powder, which was flavorful but not at all spicy. We had them for dinner and enjoyed them thoroughly!"
189475,146427,2012-01-18,4,These were really good but I think they needed some dipping sauce. Next time I'll try dipping them in ranch dressing or BBQ sauce.
29014,8782,2002-02-17,5,"This recipe is not only delicious, it is ridiculously easy!!  Besides basting now & then, there's not much else you need to do.  I added a little water to the dish to facilitate basting (I used a stoneware baker, and the pan juices were absorbed - next time I'll use glass!).  And there will definitely BE a next time - this chicken is good enough for Company!  One more comment:  The spice mix would make a great seasoned salt for other recipes, such as roasted potatoes, grilled veggies, etc.  FIVE STARS!"
26512,8782,2003-08-16,5,"Outstanding roast chicken! I did make some changes, matter of fact, I didn't marinate this overnight and it fell off the bone it was so tender.
I stuffed lemon slices and whole sprigs of rosemary and sage under the breast skin and tossed the rest of the lemon in the cavity. Rubbed with a little butter and slathered on the spices.
One of the very best I've had, and I'll certainly be making this again. Thanks for sharing."
132764,8782,2004-04-01,4,"Amazing, fall off the bone tender juicy chicken!! Love the marinating and cooking technique! Didn't care for the spicyness of the rub. Will use this again for sure, but with my own spices. "
37449,8782,2004-06-27,5,"My husband took his first bite and said,""Wow"". So I will be making this again! I only used 1/4 tsp. cayenne and omitted the white pepper, adding a little more black pepper. I rubbed the chicken, then put in the roasting pan, let it marinate about 4 hours, then baked. It was worth waiting for. I added 5 or 6 small roasting potatoes aabout 1 1/2 hours before it was done, rolling them around in the juices. Delicious! Thanks so much for posting this! Next time I think I will try a tbls. of brown sugar with it, and there will be a next time!"
95743,8782,2004-08-22,5,"Beyond a doubt the prettiest chicken I ever roasted.  Certainly one of the top five best tasting, maybe top three.  This will be what I make the next time I need a picnic entree.  Roasted, then wrapped up tightly and refrigerated until needed, this would make perfect carry along finger food.  Followed the recipe exactly (except for the garbage bag).  Be sure to rub a lot of that seasoning under the skin.  "
52543,8782,2004-08-27,5,"The BEST non BBQ'd chicken I've ever eaten! With 60 reviews already, I can't provide any ""helpful"" comments - but I can post the first photo. Thanx C. Chatwin!  "
37036,8782,2004-09-07,5,"This roasted chicken was crispy on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside.  PERFECT!  My DH normally hates chicken, but he really liked it prepared this way.  I followed the directions exactly.  Next time I think I will cut the salt to 2 teaspoons, as I thought it was just a little salty, yet it had a wonderful flavor.  I used plastic wrap to wrap up the chicken, as I've heard trash can liner contain toxic materials which are harmful.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing a ""keeper"" of a recipe!"
64642,8782,2004-11-16,5,This recipe is easy and wonderful
64934,8782,2005-03-13,5,"Wonderful moist juicy chicken!  The only change I made to the recipe was to reduce the salt to 2 teaspoons.  I put the spices on the chicken and set it in an ovenproof dish, then covered the whole thing with saran wrap to sit in the fridge overnight.  It was just a matter of removing the saran wrap and then popping it in the oven for five hours.  We loved this delicious chicken and it will be a regular item on our menu!  Thanks!"
189616,8782,2005-04-29,5,"Um, wow!. Don't know if I should have felt insultated or not when my DH asked me if I bought the chicken precooked! Seasonings quite spicy, so my DS's only wanted the meat, no skin. Next time I will cook it on a rack, the cluck/cluck as sitting in alot of grease.
Thank you C Chatwin!"
59473,8782,2005-05-23,5,I made this tonight for supper and it was absolutely delicious. I made it exactly as stated and it was so tender and moist. Thanks for a great recipe.
42720,8782,2005-06-11,5,We were very pleased with the way this recipe turned out.  The chicken was fork tender and very flavorful.  I did baste mine frequently and it was worth it because the chicken was very moist.
137911,8782,2005-09-20,5,"Really delicious!  I used the rub as written and found the combination to be fine for our family, kids and all.  I read the various opinions on the slow-cooking method this recipe calls for and the concerns. For my own info, I looked up the government website and found a section on 'slow cooking' for chicken. http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Focus_On_Slow_Cooker_Safety/index.asp   It states: ""The direct heat from the pot, lengthy cooking and steam created within the tightly-covered container combine to destroy bacteria and make the slow cooker a safe process for cooking foods.""  So with that, I felt more comfortable using my Necco Roaster which has a cover.  Turned out great!  I would suggest that those cooking in the ovven use a roasting pan with a lid as well to be safe.  Pam :-)
"
185285,8782,2005-12-22,5,"GREAT meal!  I didn't have 12+ hours to marinate it, so my bird only got 2 hours of sitting before I cooked it. I really like the addition of white pepper - which sounds like an insignificant ingredient, but it really gets into the meat nicely if you're a pepper fan!!"
169969,8782,2005-12-27,5,For the 101th time.... FABULOUS! This chicken has wonderful flavors with a moist and tasty meat. I made a 6.5 pound chicken with hopes there would be leftovers for sandwiches - there was nothing left! The sesoning was perfect. The skin was out of this world perfect! Thanks for posting!
52262,8782,2006-02-10,5,"Everyone loved this chicken except my husband for some reason.  I used chicken parts because I do not do a good job carving: 1 whole chicken previously cut-up and 4 leg quarters.  I still used the same amount of spices for all of this chicken.  I think if I had used all of the spices on one chicken alone, it would have tasted very salty, but with more chicken it was fine.  I covered the pans and baked the chicken for 4 hours.  At that point I uncovered the pans for another 1/2 hour.  I checked the chicken pieces then and the internal temperatures were all in the 180s.  Nothing was overcooked or dry.  Some pieces were falling off the bone moist.  I forgot to baste but realized I didn't need to since the chicken was sitting the its juices the entire time.  I think this also contributed to the juicy factor.  This is a great easy recipe suitable for company."
55729,8782,2006-04-14,4,"I got compliments on this, but I did not personally like it. It seemed a bit overcooked, with a texture like chicken from the crockpot. I guess that is ok if you like that sort of thing."
32772,8782,2006-05-21,5,"Fabulous, Fabulous!! I followed the directions for prepartion as stated and wrapped the chicken in plastic wrap. The only change I made was to cook it in my crockpot on Low for 10 hours. The chicken was Fabulous and the gravy was outstanding. I love cooking chicken in the crockpot because it remains juicy and tender. The meat just fell off the bone. This is a true keeper."
255338,8782,2006-08-28,5,"Our chickens here are a little smaller, so I roasted two at the same time. As per another reviewer, I made 1 1/2 recipe of the seasoning, and added potatoes about 1 hour before finishing. Next time, I have to make 3 in one sitting, they are THAT good. Thank you for posting."
51011,8782,2006-10-08,5,"There are a million variations of this recipe floating around here... I have made this one, and found it to be really good.  I use a ziplock bag to marinate the chicken.  Have even left it marinating for 2 days with good results.  I usually omit the white pepper, because I never have any on hand.  Thanks! "
174991,8782,2006-11-11,5,This is so moist and tender.  The whole house smelt so good especilly coming in from the cold.  It looks so great that I hated to cut into it!
133174,8782,2006-11-12,5,"What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said about this wonderful recipe?  I misread the directions and instead of basting every 30 minutes, I basted every hour and it still turned out great.  The chicken was done in the 5 hours and the rub had penetrated the meat making for a well seasoned dish.  The chicken was moist, tender and beautifully golden.  My guests were very impressed."
402559,8782,2007-01-07,5,"Awesome flavor, thanks for sharing!"
55578,8782,2007-03-03,5,"Very good recipe.  I couldn't baste my chicken as I was at work, so I added some water in the bottom of the pan at the beginning.  I had a very small chicken so I only baked it 4 hrs, but it was nice and tender with great spices on it.  Not sure why it is called 'sticky' chicken though."
666723,8782,2008-03-31,5,"I also made this last minute so it didn't have a chance to sit overnight.  This chicken comes out so extremely moist!  With the amount of cayenne pepper it was a little spicy, but only because I used a YOUNG chicken instead of a large one!  This chicken is just great!  There are not many chicken recipes out there that I will leave the skin on for, but this one is a must.  The skin is so good and I can't wait to make it again!  The house smelled amazing while it baked for 5 hours!  I also stuffed a few garlic cloves into the chicken with the onion and served it with garlic mashed potatos and gravy.  Great Sunday dinner!"
140806,8782,2008-08-11,5,DH gives this 5 stars all the way! For a small chicken 2 onions wouldn't fit. I think we only got 3/4 of one in the cavity and placed the rest in the roasting rack. A bit labor/time intensive but worth the wait. Had to add about two cups water to the roasting pan in order to keep basting. The end result was really impressive looking. Delicious and cheap! Perfect for our small dinner party!
264017,8782,2008-11-23,5,"Proud to be the 210th reviewer for this winner! I also did not marinate overnight, but rubbed the spices on just before roasting at 375* for one hour, then at 250* for 3 more hours. Also, it didn't get basted at all since my guys at home ""forgot"" while I was out. It was still fabulously juicy and enjoyed by all. I did roast the chicken  ""breast side down"" to allow the juices to keep this part moist. Served with Recipe #260383 which uses many of the same spices. Perfect!"
92886,8782,2008-12-06,3,"I wonder if I did something wrong when I don't like a dish as well as everyone else did. However, I didn't think the finished product was worth the preparation effort and cook time.  The skin wasn't very crispy and the long cooking time produced a texture in the meat I really don't prefer.  I did enjoy the chicken and so did my guests, so I certainly don't regret making it, I just think there are other cooking methods I prefer more."
229524,8782,2009-03-07,5,GREAT RECIPE!!!!  Placed the chicken in a deep  bowl and covered it.  This way the spices wouldn't come off the chicken and stick to the plastic.  Did add a few slices of butter under the skin.  Also add some of the spice mix under the skin.  Placed a few lemon slices in the cavity along with the onion.  When I did check on the chicken the skin did look a little dry so I poured a little olive oil over it.  We will certainly make this delicious chicken again.
844554,8782,2009-06-26,5,I really liked the spice combination. I didn't have a whole chicken so I just used bone-in chicken breasts. Thanks for the recipe.
808027,8782,2009-08-14,5,"I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  Perfectly spiced!  My kids announced (after only a bite) that it is their new favorite meal.  I did cook it at 350 for a shorter time due to the warnings indicated in some of the reviews, but it still turned out perfectly...crispy, juicy and a perfect blend of spices.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!!!"
1122161,8782,2009-12-17,5,I made this using my George Forman rotesserie and it turned out awesome! The spices are so delicious! It turned out so moist and juicy in 1 and a half hours and no basting since the rotsserie is self basting! I don't think I've ever had roasted chicken this good! Thanks for posting!
68960,8782,2010-07-25,5,"For us I used garlic salt instead of plain salt, left out the cayenne, used about 4 T (if not more) of dried onions along with the other ingredients which I zapped in the food processor.  I also used a lime chopped up along with the onion which I stuffed inside the chicken.  Cooked on a rack basting often and it cooked up beautifully.  Great recipe, thank you."
140132,8782,2010-11-17,5,"Oh my gosh this is good.  I made this for my family and we couldnt get enough.  I loved the seasoning blend and plan on using it often for all our chicken recipe.....grilling , frying, roasting.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us....we loved it."
1072593,8782,2010-12-22,5,"While you were off Christmas shopping, I was here making your Sticky Chicken.  Too bad you missed the smiling faces of my family as the juices ran down their arms."
103876,8782,2011-10-26,5,I cut up my chicken before preparing this recipe and cooked it for 4 hours instead of 5.  I cut up one onion and put it in the bottom of the pan.  It turned out beautiful and delicious.  I had to add some water as it was baking to make some more juice.  My whole family commented on how good this was so I'm sure I will be making again.  Thanks for posting.
305531,8782,2011-12-07,5,I've been making this chicken for years. I found a similar recipe on another site way back when and loved it. I gave this recipe to my DD to make as her first meal for her in-laws. Even though she can't cook.....they loved her meal! :lol: Thanks C Chatwin for a winner. Made for Cookbook Tag.
482376,8782,2012-01-31,5,"I was so surprised how well this chicken turned out. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was really fall-off-the-bone tender. We enjoyed the spice mixture, which made the chicken very flavorful and different from my regular roast chicken. Thank you for a great recipe!"
218535,8782,2012-04-24,5,Very good and easy.
377039,8782,2012-12-06,4,"I didn't marinate, and cooked for a shorter time at 325 degrees.  I also made a mistake and added chili powder (grabbed the wrong bottle when looking for paprika!).  I thoroughly enjoyed the seasoning."
191533,8782,2013-07-25,5,"Very good! I didn&#039;t bother with the bag; just covered the pan of chicken wi/ plastic wrap while marinating. We needed to eat earlier than I expected and the chicken was done nicely, at 4.25 hours baking time.&lt;br/&gt;**Made it again, but it&#039;s too hot for the oven! I put it in the crockpot, on high for 2 hours and low for 2 hours- WONDERFUL! Even the breast was moist!!"
37779,8782,2014-07-26,5,"Delicious roast chicken. Perfectly seasoned, skin crisp, meat tender. Made exactly as directed, no changes. Thanks."
128473,200296,2007-01-10,5,"Wow! Kitten this is so wonderful.  I knew that this chicken dish was  going to be good...but I wasn't expecting that the ranch dressing would impart so much flavour.  We really enjoyed this moist, tender, flavourful and fall apart chicken. Thanks for sharing."
158086,200296,2007-02-25,5,"we really enjoyed this, my company ate it all up and I was afraid I had made too much...."
331557,200296,2007-04-12,3,We liked it.  It came out moist.  The butter was unnecessary and if I make it again I think I will omit it along with the seasoning salt.  Thanks for sharing.
229524,200296,2007-06-03,5,"LOVE this dish!!!  It's like a burst of flavor in your mouth when you eat this YUMMY chicken.  Will be making often, doesn't get any easier than this.  The chicken was also very moist.  Thanks Kittncal for another wonderful recipe."
280166,200296,2007-11-26,3,"For my family, this was just OK - our crust was soggy and not crispy at all.  Thanks for posting!"
248023,200296,2007-12-13,5,"This transforms the ordinary and usually ""boring"" chicken breast into something to be craved at least once a week!  I halved the recipe just b/c there is only two of us... I didn't marinate the breasts in the ranch since I was a little short on time, but I will next time to see if it makes a difference.  I did bake them on a rack over a pan, and the breasts turned out so juicy on the inside and golden brown and crispy on the top and bottom.  That is really the trick to not getting that nasty soggy crust... My BF is now requesting this at least once a week...  Thanks for another great one!!!"
632249,200296,2007-12-15,5,"This smelled so good and the finished product did not disappoint us.  I did marinate the breasts as suggested and I did add the cheese on top during the last few minutes of baking.  They were delish. Thanks Kitten, your recipes are always fabulous."
231054,200296,2008-01-06,5,"The minute I took my first bite of this chicken I saw ""stars"" -- lots and lots of them!!!  This chicken is just wonderful.  I used the panko breadcrumbs and they stayed so nice and crispy while baking.  I followed Kit's instructions to bake on a baking sheet (I covered it with the non-stick foil) and the bottoms of the chicken were not soggy at all.  This is such an easy recipe to put together -- very quick.  I only used 4 chicken breasts but it took just about all the the breadcrumb mixture -- so if I were to do the 6, I'd increase that portion of the recipe.  I made this for Kitten's Tagathon -- and I'm sure glad I did!!!"
620763,200296,2008-01-24,4,Very tasty chicken and easy to prepare. I baked mine at 375 and they came out perfect. Will make again.
529278,200296,2009-01-30,5,Yum!
774665,200296,2008-03-22,5,Okay... I'm a fan of Kitten! This was another winner!
470351,200296,2008-03-24,5,"Kittencal...you've done it again!!!  Dang was this excellent!!!!!!!!  I used the panko bread crumbs and probably used 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese for the coating.  I also added in some crushed red peppers and some Garli Garni (my favorite seasoning!).  I only had 1/2 cup of ranch dressing to my 3 extremely large chicken breasts and it was the perfect amount.  I followed another reviewers advise of baking the chicken on a rack on a foil lined baking sheet.  PERFECT!  Nothing soggy about my chicken tonight and my husband thought it was a home run!  I used margarine (all I had) and also was perfect.  We will definitely be making this one again and again.  Super quick, super easy!  Kitten...I'll be making MANY more of your recipes.  They never fail and are always sure to please.  Thank you!!!"
140132,200296,2008-06-22,5,"Delicious.  This is very good chicken.  I like to make chicken breasts in all different flavors and this is right at the top.  DS is not a fan of ranch dressing but liked the chicken anyway.  Thank you for posting this yummy version of chicken breasts, will make often."
147109,200296,2008-08-27,5,"I had made this for my two toddler sons (who loved it) as I had made it into small chicken pieces.  My husband had the very few leftovers, and he made me make them again the next night so he could eat them too!  Very good!  Thanks so much!"
426903,200296,2008-09-15,5,"OH MY GOODNESS, were these tasty! My sister recommended this dish to me, and it was so wonderful. I only used four chicken breasts, and barely had enough breading, but I also cut my chicken into smaller pieces. My dh gobbled it up very quickly. I had to cut him off since he wanted to eat the extras I am saving for lunch tomorrow. I never thought to use a salad dressing to coat the breading. I paired this with Recipe #97141 and it turned out great. Thank Kitten for another wonderful recipe!"
140806,200296,2008-11-06,5,"Rave reviews from all diners! Used Kraft Peppercorn Ranch. Smelled delicious and easy to boot. You have another great one on your hands, Kittencal!"
149363,200296,2008-12-11,5,Crazy delicious! I scaled this recipe down to feed three of us and the amounts were perfect. I also had one little lonely pork chop left in my fridge to cook up....so I used the same recipe. It was awesome too! Thanks for dinner Kitten! :) {{HUGS}}
189475,200296,2009-02-15,5,"Quick, easy and delicious! I cooked mine on a cookie sheet and didn't have any problems with it getting soggy. The bottom was crispy, which may have been because of using the cookie pan but it also could have been from the butter I put on top of the chicken that got all over the pan. This chicken was so good that I didn't even put sauce on it. That's saying a lot because I put sauce on almost everything and always have some type of sauce on chicken. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
169969,200296,2009-02-19,5,This is a 5 for simple and easy! A very fast recipe with very little effort. Our 7 year old loved this the most! Thanks Kitten!
55578,200296,2009-03-16,5,Really nice and moist.
286851,200296,2009-06-07,4,"Made this recipe this week, and it ws a hit. Used chicken tender pieces. Though I followed all of the suggestions for avoiding a ""soggy"" bottom crust, the bottom of the chicken still did stick somewhat, removing the coating on the bottom, and it did not crisp up. However, it didn't really bother us--the flavor was still wonderful. Even my two picky girls enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing--will definitely make again."
93006,200296,2009-07-16,5,"We titled!  It is easy and delicious!  I used homemade ranch, which I'm sure made it extra juicy and moist ;).  The combo of spices was perfect.  It really was a fast meal to put together and everyone loved it."
37036,200296,2009-11-09,5,"Delicious!  I've been wanting to try this recipe for a while now and I'm so glad I finally gave it a try.  I used chicken tenders and cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes, because they were thin.  I also used Jalapeno Ranch dressing, because that is all I had on hand.  The chicken was very flavorful and very moist.  I'd definitley make this recipe again.  Thank you Kittencal for another winning recipe!"
318235,200296,2009-12-02,5,Fantastic recipe. I made this using two Tilapia fillets and a fresh Cobia fillet. It was so moist and succulent (even though the Tilapia was a little freezer burnt). I am looking forward to trying this with chicken. Thanks Kitten!
262312,200296,2010-02-12,5,"another winning recipe, kitten!!  i changed this up a bit to make chicken nuggets for dh and dd.  i cut up my chicken earlier in the day and let marinate in bottled buttermilk hidden valley ranch dressing (I used almost the whole bottle).  i used panko breadcrumbs instead of regular.  i only needed to bake for 15 minutes or so since the pieces were so small.  this was a very flavorful winner and so easy to put together!  thanks again, kitten!!"
1506604,200296,2010-04-21,4,It was good and simple but I couldn't taste the ranch and the parmesan taste was too subtle.
250031,200296,2010-05-02,5,"Very tasty, easy and the chicken was so moist! Love it! Will be making this again and again. (Update: I had 3 thick pork chops left over from another meal and made them this way too last night but had them for dinner tonight--also five stars with pork chops!)"
242484,200296,2010-05-12,5,Great recipe!  I even made it with lite ranch dressing and no butter on top and it still was delicious and the family all loved it!
407007,200296,2010-06-16,5,"Thanks! This is another great keeper! I used chicken tenders and lightened it by using Light Hidden Valley Ranch, not using salt, and not using any butter (although I did spray the tops of chicken with the butter non stick cooking spray before baking.) The amounts were perfect. DH who claims to HATE ranch, LOVED this (of course he doesn't know ranch was in it ;)) and requested it again already. It's great and will be used often -- thanks again for sharing this one!"
389431,200296,2012-10-05,5,This was AWESOME!  DH loved it so much he went back for thirds...  Thanks for making me look like a star in the kitchen!
914720,200296,2010-08-30,5,"This was great!  The chicken was moist and tender.  I used dried breadcrumbs that I had on hand, but I would love to try it again with panko.  Served with roasted fingerling potatoes and a vegetable.  Thanks for sharing!"
55729,200296,2010-12-18,4,"I enjoyed this and my family enjoyed this. I have another ranch chicken recipe, but it takes 3 times as long to make and uses bone-in chicken, which some of my family members don't like. This one is not quite as good, but it is ""good enough"" and I can certainly see myself making this one far more often. The only problem I had was that I ran out of breadcrumbs. Next time I would double the breadcrumb mixture. I used 1/3 c. of cheese (cotijo instead of parmesan, but it is essentially the same) and 1 tsp. each of pepper and garlic powder. I actually had plenty of dressing. I cooked this on a rack in a half-sheet pan to try to make it more crispy. It still was not particularly crispy (maybe due to the lack of crumbs) so next time I might actually cook it straight on foil in the half-sheet to ease cleanup. I wouldn't use a smaller pan, though. I served this with Recipe #72735 and Recipe #321880."
207176,200296,2011-01-25,5,Just made this but used Casar dressing and cornflake crumbs.  Came out crispy and kids liked it a lot.  Next time I hope to use Ranch...thought I had it but I was out so I improvised. Thanks Kitten!
32058,200296,2011-06-27,5,Super moist and delicious.  Goes together super quick!
218535,200296,2011-09-06,5,Wonderful. We did not change a thing.
928301,200296,2011-09-06,5,"I loved this.  I halved the recipe because I was only cooking 2 breasts, but I used 2/3 of the seasoning measures (garlic, pepper & seasoning salt) because I love flavor.  As I was eating, I was thinking of how perfect it was, nice and moist & although my chicken was thick the cooking time was just right.  Thank you Kittencal, this was easy to make and a pleasure to eat."
88099,200296,2011-09-11,5,Excellent flavoring.  I used a Bacon Ranch dressing (wonderful) and Panco Bread Crumbs which really made this a crunchy delight.  I did add some Southern Garlic flavoring which I love.  My chicken turned out nice and crisp and very moist on the inside.  I did use a baking rack on top of my baking dish and that seemed to work very well.  Thanks Kitz for sharing.  Made for the diabetic forum September event.
187373,200296,2013-06-13,5,These were really tasty! I made a half recipe using chicken tenders. Use regular bread crumbs but baked on a cooling rack on top of a baking pan which helped keep it from getting soggy on the bottom. These will be made again! Thanks for sharing.
447123,200296,2013-09-23,5,Totally loved this chicken! I didn&#039;t get a lot because the kids ate most of it! Thanks for another winner.
1581225,200296,2014-09-10,5,Another fantastic recipe from Kittencal! This was so easy to make and so so yummy.
333017,200296,2015-05-07,5,Ditto to all the comments!  Used crumbs from the end of a homemade potato bread and forgo the butter as it was not needed!  Delicious!
52543,52262,2003-10-13,4,This was a tasty & different way to use the green tomatoes from our garden at the end of the season. Some items aren't available here - so (as recommended by the recipe poster) I substituted cumin for the fenugreek seeds & 1/4 cup fresh chopped mango for the mango powder. Thanx PetsRus!!
133174,52262,2007-09-19,5,"Wonderful!  I served this as part of a vegetarian dinner using the fenugreek seeds, fresh jalapenos from the garden and lemon juice.  I can only imagine this on top of saffron rice."
133174,106251,2005-01-06,5,There is nothing that brings out the sweat mellow taste of garlic like roasting.  This dish was quick to put together and required minimal attention while cooking.  I sprayed my casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray to facilitate clean-up. Delicious!
145352,106251,2005-08-16,5,This was great! My hubby declared it a winner!
53932,106251,2005-10-16,5,"Very good, even if I did roast at the wrong temperature.  I used less rosemary than indicated as I think the flavor is usually overpowering.  I used about 3/8 tsp pepper and would use less next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe."
92886,106251,2005-12-04,5,"I experimented with how this would turn out with frozen cauliflower.  It was excellent.  I didn't even defrost it first.  I was also in a pretty big hurry to serve up dinner so rather than try to mash up the garlic cloves , I took all the contents of the dish, dumped it in the food processor and hit the pulse buttons a few times.  I guess if you were going for visual appeal to impress guests, you wouldn't do that, but  for a regular family meal it's a good short cut."
68460,106251,2005-12-08,5,"Excellent!  My whole family loved this cauliflower, including my husband who has always hated it....he actually had a second helping!  This is so easy to throw together and the flavor is addictive.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe Rita :)"
47907,106251,2005-12-15,5,This was so good!  I had a smallish head of cauliflower so I only used 10 cloves of garlic but I used the full amount of everything else.  We are not rosemary fans so we left that out.  It was so delicious!  We mashed the cauliflower on our plates and spread the roasted garlic over the top ~ ummm!  Thanks for posting a keeper that's really easy to do at the last minute!
95743,106251,2005-12-22,5,"I expected good things from this recipe considering all the five star ratings, but this surpassed my expectations.  This is one of those recipes I'd give 10 stars if I could. It really is perfect with a loaf of crusty bread.  I did use fresh oregano rather than rosemary-just a personal preference.  Loved it. My garlic didn't soften much in thirty minutes-I didn't care, tasted great."
222433,106251,2006-01-22,5,That is some fantastic cauliflower! I followed the recipe exactly. The garlic was outstanding!The kids like it too! Thanks Rita!
307214,106251,2006-07-30,4,Roasted over the campfire in a roasting bag... very tasty.  Also cut back on the oil.  Will try this again.
227607,106251,2006-08-30,5,"I loved this...a much lighter way to serve cauliflower(compared to drenched with cheese).  Even the kids loved it.

Karen"
347822,106251,2007-01-21,4,"Absolutely, loved this dish.  Next time, I will cut the garlic cloves in half.  My garlic cloves were pretty big and required more roasting time. Sixteen garlic cloves seems alot but when roasted its nice and sweet and blends well with the fresh rosemary.  Thank you loads for the posting."
373817,106251,2007-02-28,5,This was very delicious! I took the advice of others and used oregano instead of rosemary. I will be making this again because even my 2 year old ate it!! Thanks for the great recipe!
316717,106251,2007-03-11,4,pretty good. followed directions except i used dried rosemary since that's all i had on hand and chopped/minced half of the garlic n' left the rest whole. next time i'll cut back on the olive oil since my one head of califlower were swimming in it and cut back a little on the salt since for my taste it was a little salty. maybe i should've used kosher salt? but overall a very tasty recipe. thanks for sharing!
188119,106251,2007-03-18,5,Yum yum and very easy... thanks a lot! I think fresh rosemary is a must with this recipe... I used coarse sea salt and possibly a little more oil.  It was really good and I will definitely be making this again.. thanks!
318235,106251,2010-01-25,5,Another a-plus review. This recipe is going in my permanent side dish file. Thank you!!
52262,106251,2007-08-26,5,"What a great way to make cauliflower!  I doubled the spice amounts but left the amount of olive oil at 1/4 cup.  After about 15 minutes of cooking, I stirred the cauliflower and drizzled a little more oil on top."
37449,106251,2007-10-04,5,Delicious! I love roasted cauliflower and I love roasted garlic! Thank you Rita!
140132,106251,2007-10-31,5,"This is very good.  I love rosemary and the combination was a great combo.  I will make again b/c it was very simple to prepare...and so tasty, great recipe.  thank you for this....Stephanie"
470351,106251,2008-01-07,5,"HOLY COW!!!!  Who knew that cauliflower could be so great???  I am not a cooked cauliflower fan but am looking to expand my family's horizons in the vegetable department and holy cow this changed my mind about cauliflower!  Not only was the cooked dish amazing, but I was nibbling on the raw cauliflower with the olive oil and seasonings on it before I could even get it into the oven!!!  Fresh rosemary is a must!  I also used about 20 cloves of garlic.  My kids even ate this and my husband kept saying ""oh my God, oh my God"" as he ate this.  This will definitely be a regular in my house!  Even if you hate cauliflower, you have GOT to try this!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
54678,106251,2008-01-24,5,"I now have a new fav roasted vegetable - cauliflower. Awesome!
My cauliflower was small so I added a large white onion and 1 large yam cubed and I was short on the 16 garlic cloves but it was still a great dish."
125640,106251,2008-01-25,5,"Very easy and very yummy. I used oregano rather than rosemary and added a pinch of hot pepper flakes to make it go a little better with my main course. Tasted great, but DH thought it needed something green mixed in to contrast, so will try adding asparagus tips or zucchini next time. Thanks for sharing."
191533,106251,2008-02-14,5,Delicious! 120 reveiws don't lie. I use thyme instead of rosemary.
248023,106251,2008-03-20,5,"I have been wanting to try this recipe for months now... but cauliflower has been so expensive lately.  Finally, I found some on sale and got the chance to see what everyone was raving about.  WOW!!!  I thought I hated cauliflower, but it must have been the oversteamed and underseasoned cauliflower of my youth that I detested.  The roasting filled my house with a wonderful aroma ( well, if you love garlic, like us!) and the cauliflower was so sweet and tender.  The two of us ate the whole head and all the garlic by ourselves...  Just delicious!  The only change I made was to leave out the rosemary.  I didn't have any fresh or dried and to be honest, my BF and I find it's aroma a little overpowering sometimes.  We loved it without and it was just wonderful with the salt and pepper...  I will cut back just a tad on the salt next time... but other than that... a great recipe!!! Thanks for sharing Rita!!!"
207176,106251,2008-03-21,0,"I screwed up and minced the garlic and so I can't rate this.  I will have to try it again-I think even if I had left the cloves whole, it would have been great. :)"
331557,106251,2008-04-10,0,"I am not going to rate this at this time because I think that I must have done something really wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly (I thought), including oven temperature time and I took it out after 20 minute and a lot of the garlic was burned and too crispy and it smoked out my whole house.  After 20 minutes it was also very well done - if I would have cooked it any more it would have burned and been soggy.  I am not sure what happened here but I would like to try it again, perhaps at a lower temperature."
89831,106251,2008-05-25,5,"delicious! I used more than 16 cloves of garlic and also added in a little cayenne pepper as well as some freshly ground black pepper, simple yet so tastey, thanks for sharing Rita!"
8629,106251,2008-06-25,3,"I am definitely in the very, very minority. I thought the cauliflower turned out ok but for me it was not a 5-star recipe. I'm glad I tried it, though."
64642,106251,2008-07-15,3,"Very nice, easily made.  Very strong garlic flavor."
499050,106251,2008-07-15,5,Yum!
229850,106251,2008-10-07,5,"This was a great way to prepare Cauliflower !! I had a small head but I still put about 20 cloves of garlic, all sizes some smaller than others. We do not care for Rosemary, so I just added the salt and pepper only to the oil. It was still fantastic. Thank you for posting this new way to enjoy cauliflower, and thanks for a way to also roast garlic as I love it, but hate to use oven just for that."
7108,106251,2008-11-02,5,"You get 5 stars alone for turning me from disliking cauliflower into a cauliflower eater with this recipe.  This was awesome!  I sprayed my roasting pan w/ non stick cooking spray as another reviewer suggested, used dried rosemary, cut the salt in half, pepper amount the same and only 12 cloves of garlic, because it's all I had on hand.  Halfway through roasting, I took it out of oven, drizzled just a small amount of extra olive oil, tossed it again and roasted for the rest of the time stated.  Great flavor, even though I skimped on the garlic and the cauliflower was cooked to perfect doneness.  Thanks for posting this; I will be making this alot!"
653438,106251,2009-03-10,5,"WOW!  This was a great hit.  I cut the recipe in half and used dried rosemary (that is what I had) and added paprika to the oil, salt and  pepper.  When it came out of the oven I shredded parmesan cheese on top as suggested...wonderful.  Thank you!"
76951,106251,2009-05-17,5,"Oh my goodness, this was WONDEFUL!  I thought, ""A full head of cauliflower?  We'll never eat all that!""  Well, guess what?  There was only a small amount leftover after only 3 of us had dinner - AND it's MINE, all MINE!  I grabbed it for tomorrow's lunch, and I'm not sharing!  I did the cauliflower & garlic in a bag trick, then added the oil mixture.  I will definitely be making this one again."
176615,106251,2009-07-10,5,"Oh my gosh, this was fantastic! Only change I'd make would be to double the recipe to have enough leftover for breakfast :) Roasting brings out a creamines in the garlic and cauliflower which is so rich and incredible, it almost tastes cheesy. For sure a guilt-free pleasure. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
285039,106251,2009-11-08,5,"This is an excellent way to prepare cauliflower!  I transferred mine to a serving bowl, so I could capture all the wonderful drippings that fell to the bottom of the pan.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
121185,106251,2009-11-26,5,Like this needs another review!!!  WOW!  Mom actually said that this was the best cauliflower she ever tasted (who says that about the lowly cauliflower?!!?).  SHe actually went out and bought a head to make some for herself at home.  I wont make cauliflower any other way ever again. ** I also wanted to add that this reheats beautifully - so I'll be baking this up at home and bringing it to Thanksgiving & reheating it there**
280166,106251,2009-11-26,5,Both my husband and I loved this recipe!  Can't wait to serve it to guests.  Thanks for posting!
146047,106251,2009-12-08,5,Awesome!
1365025,106251,2009-12-09,5,"I love cauliflower but the only way I ever prepared it was either raw for snacking or steamed for meals. I was kinda leery to try this recipe thinking who would want to eat overly browned cauliflower. Well it's Wonderful! Really enjoyed this although I left out the rosemary, didn't have any on hand. Couldn't go to the store as we had 14 1/2 inches of snow overnight and I'm still trying to muster up the energy to go out and shovel that nice white heavy stuff they call snow. Humbug!!"
226863,106251,2010-01-10,5,"I thought I rated this last night, but I don't see the review, so here it goes again.  This is a 5+ star recipe for me.  I halved the recipe, and I greatly regretted doing so.  I could have eaten the entire head by myself!  This will be a definite repeat for me!  Absolutely loved this!"
298447,106251,2010-01-23,5,"I could eat these like candy!  Nevermind that I use frozen cauliflower  in place of the fresh stuff.  It's sacrilege, I know, but it still tastes soooo good!  (I prep the frozen cauliflower by steaming in the microwave for a few minutes & then draining, before mixing and roasting in the oven.)  I've made this a few times now...and prefer it with a little less salt and not as much oil, so that flavor of the garlic, cauliflower and rosemary are allowed to really shine through.  Awesome recipe, Rita...thanks so much!"
195589,106251,2010-01-25,5,"Man alive, is this ever good! Like another reviewer, I toss it all into a gallon freezer bag and shake away to have a good coating. I also mince my fresh rosemary very finely. The garlic is heaven...great spread on some sour dough bread. Easy, delicious AND healthy, what more can we ask for? Thanks for posting Rita."
368078,106251,2010-02-03,5,"Yummy!!  We used dried rosemary instead of fresh, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  10 stars for this one! :)"
93006,106251,2010-02-07,5,Must add my 5 stars!  3 of us demolished the entire pan!  Wonderful - who knew healthy could be so good!
264017,106251,2010-02-21,5,"As the 266th reviewer, I'm sure I can't say much more than what's already been said... This is wonderful! I used about 1/2 the amount of EVOO as listed and also used dried rosemary (I know, shame on me), and we still loved it. Next time, I will get a fresh bunch of rosemary. Tip: Remember to rub your garlicky fingers along a stainless steel blade to get rid of the garlic smell. Thanks for another winner Rita!"
482376,106251,2010-02-26,5,"Mmmmm. What a delightful treat this was. I would even eat this as a snack. The roasting with olive oil and the simple flavors of salt, pepper, rosemary and garlic makes the cauliflower an all-star. My only caution...  I typically roast cauliflower so it turns black in spots (call me crazy, but I love it done that way). This does not work well when you have garlic cloves!! I thought I'd add that to my review in case there is someone else out there who takes the cauliflower to that level of doneness. ;)"
74281,106251,2010-03-18,5,"Not only did this make the kitchen smell fabulous, it tasted really good. My family went crazy over this recipe. The garlic was toasty brown, mild and sweet and the rosemary really complimented everything. I did cheat and use frozen cauliflower that I thawed out in the microwave. Put everything in a big bowl with a lid and tossed it around then threw it into a pan. Easy and delicious!!"
1122161,106251,2010-03-30,5,"This was really good tasting cauliflower! Everything went together so nicely, and was easy to put together. ** I found out that you can freeze rosemary and it's as good as fresh, I guess you just put in a baggy stems and all and when your ready to use the leaves just pop off...can last over a year even! Thanks for posting this, we really enjoyed it! :)"
189616,106251,2010-04-04,5,"Sooo Delicious, this is a 6 star recipe. Thank You!"
371738,106251,2010-09-06,5,"DELICIOUS!!!!!! Ate the garlic, too.  All 16 cloves!"
103876,106251,2011-01-27,5,This was such a great way to make cauliflower. I used 3 whole heads of garlic and it was wonderful even left over the next day. Thanks for posting.
8688,106251,2012-04-03,5,"Who Knew?  Who knew cauliflower could taste so good??!!  With all these fantastic reviews I knew I would have to give this recipe a try.  This will definitely be my ""Go-To"" Recipe for Cauliflower from now on!  So easy to do, so very little effort for fantastic results!  Thanks so much, Rita!!"
362983,106251,2012-07-10,5,"This is perfect for the garlic lover! I didn't quite use as many garlic cloves, maybe half as much, but the garlic still flavoured the cauliflower beautifully. Pllus roasted garlic is so delicious already. I used dry rosemary instead of fresh and it worked out well. I'd definitely make this again; thanks!"
126440,106251,2012-10-19,5,Love the roasted cauliflower but my garlic was burnt.  Will leave the skin on and cook them that way.
178742,106251,2013-02-19,5,"Oh, oh, ohhh!! Just took out the oven, and OMG, it is soooo good! I followed directions exactly! But I wanted to do as other reviewers suggested and toss cauiflower and turn heat down to 350 and cook for another 30 minutes.. But nooooo, Husband took out oven for me, and  started to eat it and couldn't stop and said he can not imagine how it would taste better than it already does by adding another 30 minutes.. So I left it as is and totally agree wit him! That's a first! And I would not adjust a thing for this recipe! I love Zaar (aka food.com)!!!! Og, and of course I took a picture to post here!!"
333017,106251,2013-10-11,5,361 posters have said it all!  Excellent side dish!!!  Made the prep easy by buying a bag of already peeled garlic at Costco.  Made it a snap to put together!!!
540346,106251,2015-03-01,5,"This is my new favorite way to have cauliflower.  I LOVED it.  The garlic was amazing, too.  I also added carrots to the mix, which was okay, but the carrots are a different density and cook at a different pace so they weren&#039;t as soft.  If I do that again, I will cut the carrots into smaller chunks.  I made this a second time and put grape tomatoes in with the cauliflower.  AMAZING!  So sweet and juicy."
198154,106251,2015-03-04,5,"I usually turn my nose up at cauliflower, yuck.  But this is delicious!!  Five stars from my very picky family!!"
1581225,106251,2017-07-15,5,"This is amazing! The tastiest cauliflower I have ever had. Can't cook it any other way now. The roasted garlic and rosemary flavour just goes so nicely with the cauliflower, and the roasting gives it the nicest crispy on the outside but juicy inside texture."
169969,132765,2005-09-28,5,Great Flavor and super easy! Thanks for a quick and healthy side dish!!!
174991,132765,2005-10-01,5,This is a nice combination of flavors and easy to make.  This is a keeper.
133174,132765,2005-11-13,5,"This is a great way to fix broccoli.  I used fresh broccoli crowns which were separated into flowerets, rinsed and put in a microwave safe dish.  I did not add the water and the garlic was thinly sliced and cooked along with the broccoli.  I reduced the oil to 1 tablespoon, lightly sprinkled the dish with salt and used 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  Something I know I will do again.  "
124249,132765,2005-11-13,5,"This was a very good broccoli dish. I really liked the flavor of the sauce. I added red pepper flakes and fresh garlic. Will make again.

Thanks mama's kitchen

Bullwinkle."
43083,132765,2007-03-12,5,I love lemon juice on veggies and this was no exception. YUM! So easy to half this recipe. And thats exactly what I did. Delicious dinner for 1;) Thanks Mama!
173314,132765,2007-04-10,5,Loved this....I halved the garlic powder red pepper flakes and salt and sprinkled with parmesan cheese to serve.
386849,132765,2007-11-10,5,"I thought this recipe was absolutely amazing! Very quick and easy, and very worthy of 5 stars. It will become a regular side dish at my house. Thanks!!"
579298,132765,2007-11-30,4,"This is a GREAT alternative to adding cheese to your broccoli. Much healthier and much tastier! If you are intending on using fresh broccoli, I suggest using a minimum of two heads - that, or cut the other ingredients in half. I made the mistake of using only one head, and it was a bit strong :)"
369715,132765,2007-12-26,3,"I have been looking for some new ways to make veggies. My family loves broccoli so I thought I would give this a try. Unfortunately, this didn't work for my family. We thought the flavor was too strong, it really overwhelmed the dish. I think I will try it again and cut the sauce in half."
280271,132765,2008-01-08,5,Outstanding! I used fresh broccoli and minced garlic. I steamed the broccoli cuz the microwave was in use for my main dish. This was so easy to prepare. Great flavor. We didn't find it over powering at all. I also cut the recipe down to serve 2. Worked great. This dish looks wonderful on the plate. Thanks mama's kitchen for posting.
189616,132765,2008-02-08,5,"I omitted the red pepper flakes, placed all the ingredients in a microwave steamer bag and microwaved for 6 minutes. Served this with recipe#40832 and recipe#70173"
207176,132765,2008-03-04,3,This was too salty and lemony for us BUT I think I would sprinkle lemon juice and some salt and garlic powder over some microwaved steamed broccoli because I liked it but it was too tart and salty for us.
305531,132765,2008-07-07,5,"Wow! A great way to serve broccoli. DH doesn't like broccoli and liked this one alot. I made as directed, using fresh broccoli, however I probably got a little carried away with the red pepper flakes. I mixed up the 'other' ingredients ahead of time, and didn't stop to think that the oil would absorb some of the flavor of the pepper flakes, lol. Very easy and very good. Thanks mama's kitchen for yet one more keeper! Made for ZWT4 Family Picks."
470351,132765,2008-07-29,5,Made this tonight and was shocked at how tasty it was given that it was cooked in the microwave!!  I increased the garlic (I'm a garlic nut!) and used fresh lemon juice.  I also increased the crushed red pepper in this and thought it was really great!  Will make this again when I'm in a pinch for time and want a delicious veggie!  Thanks for posting!
383346,132765,2008-08-23,5,DH loved this dish.  I used fresh garlic.  I used fresh broccoli and cooked it 1 minute more.  I don't really like broccoli that's why DH had it all for himself LOL  Thanks Mama.  Made for I recommend tag game
142335,132765,2008-10-05,5,"Awesome! Delicious, fast, and easy clean up also a great way to make sure it doesn't get over cooked. I used fresh broccoli and followed your directions. Thanks! I'll use this method instead of the steamer."
136997,132765,2008-10-21,5,Super recipe! Loved the ease of prep and cooking method and had wonderful flavor. I used fresh broccoli as I don't really care for frozen. :)
140132,132765,2008-12-09,4,"Nice recipe.  I made this to go along with lemon rice and grilled fish, and it complimented it all very nicely.  So simple and yet so tasty, thanks for posting."
176615,132765,2008-12-29,5,"Delicious! Took PaulaG's suggestion and cooked the garlic along with the broccoli (I never add water when cooking broccoli in the microwave), then tossed with 1 T olive oil and 1 T fresh lemon juice. Sprinkled with Kosher salt. Will definitely try with red pepper next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
145352,132765,2009-07-12,5,"Easy and good. I used steam in bag broccoli from the freezer, cuz it's what I had on hand. Can't wait to try this with fresh broccoli!"
147109,132765,2009-08-12,5,"This was really very good, I have been dealing with lots of morning sickness and not able to even look at broccoli....but I am starting to feel better and wanted to try eating it again. This is a keeper, thanks! (I did use only half of the olive oil as it seemed to be too much."
74281,132765,2009-11-29,5,"Another one of Mama's fantastic recipes that I served for Thanksgiving. I needed a vegetable recipe that wasn't baked or done stove-top as everthing was used up on those devices, so this recipe fit the bill. Not only was it easy, it was also SO good that we will have this often!"
632249,132765,2010-05-28,4,"We thought this was a lovely side dish and a nice change of pace..  I will reduce the lemon by half next time, as it was too tart for us.  I used only 1/4 tsp of salt and skipped the red pepper flakes. Thx Mama!"
789516,132765,2010-10-02,5,"This was amazing.  What an easy way to prepare broccoli, and much better than something that is so high in fat."
937635,132765,2011-01-19,0,"I'm not going to rate this dish because DH and I thought it was bad and very bitter, so I'm wondering if the broccoli was bad. Not sure if it was that or the lemon."
15521,132765,2011-03-21,5,"Excellent way to fix broccoli. I used fresh broccoli and cooked it in my steamer (rice cooker).  I did not add any salt or red pepper flakes, but I did let the mixture sit while the broccoli was steaming.  The garlic flavor really came through and made other seasoning unnecessary (for me).  My kids weren't overly impressed, but my husband and I both enjoyed it very much!"
54678,132765,2011-04-14,5,This will become our newest fav broc recipe. Quick and tasty!!
482376,132765,2011-04-15,5,"Well this was fast and easy! I will use this recipe for those rushed dinner nights (with sports nights, that happens a lot!). I used the garlic powder. Thanks!"
131021,132765,2011-04-16,5,I think this has just the right amount of lemon to garlic and it is so easy. I used fresh broccoli and left out the red pepper flakes. I loved the ability to use fresh garlic and not get the raw garlic taste.
226863,132765,2011-04-19,3,"I used frozen broccoli, because the fresh at my store was all wilted and limp.  I'm afraid I can't recommend this using frozen broccoli.....can't say anything about using fresh!  I followed the recipe exactly, and this just turned out sort of blah and mushy....sorry so much!  I'll try it with fresh and hopefully redo my review.  Hate to leave a bad review!"
456858,132765,2011-09-20,3,"I didn't care for this.  I like my food served HOT (as in temperature) and it seemed as though this got cool really quick,and besides that, the flavor was just OK 4 me.  I might make again?"
7108,24672,2002-05-07,5,Yummmmy!  I think next time I am going to double the batch and make it in a trifle bowl and layer the shortcake then strawberries and so on.  A great summer dessert.
37779,24672,2002-05-13,5,Outstanding!! We live about 30 miles from a Berry Farm and made this with berries we picked ourselves. My family really enjoyed this and it was very easy to make. Thanks for a great recipe.
36944,24672,2002-05-20,5,This was quick and easy to make.  I served it to a group ranging in age from 22 months to 54 years.  It was a hit with everyone.  Several people had seconds!  A keeper in my book!  Thanks for sharing.
8688,24672,2002-06-17,5,"Another Inez Willenborg Classic I simply had to try.  The results as always, fabulous!  This is a sweet, delicious treat that you will not need to serve with ice cream. No need to change the recipe.  It's perfect as is!  Chalk up yet another winner for Inez!"
28603,24672,2002-06-17,5,"Very good; brought it to work and it was devoured by (wire)dawgs.  I made my own cake though, and I think it was a lot bigger than called for; seemed like it could have used even more cream cheese and whipped topping. Took all evening to make the cake, cool it, and put it together.  Next time I'll shop around to find a store-made cake."
59163,24672,2003-06-22,5,I made this for Father's Day and it was a hit.  Thought it went together easily.  Would also agree that it needs a few more berries and I did add them. A keeper for sure.
146486,24672,2004-10-01,5,This is a wonderful light dessert.  I love how the strawberries make a syrup after being mixed with the sugar.
176615,24672,2005-04-24,5,"Delicious! The only change I made was to use 2 quarts of strawberries with the same amount of sugar. I like lots of fruit and had some really beautiful berries. Also, my kids can go through a quart of strawberries on their own, I wanted the rest of us to get some, too! Thanks, MizzNezz, for a yummy dessert!"
184723,24672,2005-04-27,5,Talk about making children happy!  This is wonderful!
58836,24672,2005-05-02,5,Very good even though I only got a taste. I took to a church dinner yesterday and it was gone in a flash before I could get very much.  Had requests for the recipe.  I'm always trying new recipes (as many of you do).  Not always is my dh happy with them.  This one he was.  Thanks!
103876,24672,2005-05-08,4,I made this for our Mother's Day celebration and everyone seemed to really enjoy it.  It was also very easy to make.
95743,24672,2005-06-02,5,"The last thing this recipe needs is another review, but...
It's to-die-for.  I'll cut back 1/4 of the sugars next time. If you're craving strawberry shortcake -  this is luscious.  It'll hit the spot, for sure."
229850,24672,2006-02-18,5,"Wow We Loved This!
I doubled the creme cheese and powdered sugar, then used 2 lbs of strawberries and make a very big and elegant truffle. I started with a large homemade angel food cake and halved it. I tore the first half in small pieces and put in truffle, then the cream cheese mixture then strawberries and then repeated; ending with strawberries. It was fantastic. Thanx for a great combo."
252816,24672,2006-07-13,5,I used a 11oz angle food cake and cut all ingredients by a quarter.  It fit nicely into a 8x8 dish. Served 9 guests. Everyone loved this refreshing dessert...
278113,24672,2006-07-16,5,"I made this for a cookout/potluck yesterday, and it was the biggest hit of the day! Folks went back for two and three slices. I am sad to say there were no leftovers! LOL
I had many requests for the recipe...what a crowd pleaser! Thank you for sharing this fabulous shortcake recipe!! We will certainly make this one again and again! No more ""plain"" shortcake for us!! "
294000,24672,2006-09-03,5,Made this for a nice finish to a labor day barbeque with my parents.  Everyone loved it.  Very easy to make and there's no turning on the oven when it's hot outside.  Be warned ... it's rich!
461834,24672,2007-04-10,5,Excellent strawberry shortcake.  I made this several weeks ago and just now noticed that I didn't write a review.  This was very easy and just delicious.  I made it in a trifle bowl and it look wonderful!!!  Thank you for a great recipe MizzNezz.
140132,24672,2007-04-13,5,Oh my goodness....a cross between cheesecake and angel food cake.....yummy.  It was like two desserts in one...lol.  I made this for Easter and it was gone before the end of the evening.  I kept the strawberries on the side and let people add as many as they wanted.  I will be making this again and not just for holidays.  Thank you.......Stephanie
80998,24672,2007-05-23,4,Very good and very easy.  I was suprised by how the cake turned out.  The kids loved it.
185446,24672,2007-09-01,2,"Made this for company, and from the many good reviews, I expected oohs and aahs.  That didn't happen---the strawberries look nice, but the cake layer is not visually appealing. Someone commented it tasted more like bad textured cheesecake with strawberries. Tasted good, but no one liked the consistency."
33159,24672,2008-07-12,4,"I am really drawn to unique recipes so this one definitely caught my eye!!  I used a 10oz cake because that's all I could find & I used a 1 litre tub of Cool Whip (I'm in Canada & didn't know if I should have used the 500ml or 1 litre size???).  Great rich flavour!!  Next time I make this, I'll use an 8"" square pan & cut into 9 servings - cutting into 12 servings seemed a little chintzy to me."
489552,24672,2008-09-18,5,"I made this for my daughters baby shower, and OMG this was gone, and I mean GONE.  I had people asking for this cake and in which I had no more.  I ran out of this cake, not everyone got a piece, people were just raving how wonderful this was, so by the time others wanted a piece....no more.  I was a bit embarresed :D but at least I made up with another great dessert that I'm about to review.  Thank you, Thank you so much for a wonderful dessert."
485151,24672,2008-12-19,0,"This was good- a different change of pace from regular shortcake. Everyone in the family really enjoyed it and we will make it again.

Changes: Next time I'll use less sugar on the strawberries, maby only 1/4 cup. I layerd sliced strawberries. I layered sliced strawberries (w/o sugar on them) between two layers. I think more of the cake mixture would be nicer next time. Oh- and we used strawberry cool whip which went great with it!"
142559,24672,2009-05-18,4,"This was very good! I took a page from others and left the cake whole and covered it in the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture. Came out great! I waited until right before serving to top with strawberries so that it did not turn mushy. Next time, I may add an envelope of sugar free white chocolate pudding to the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture. Thanks for posting!"
373817,24672,2009-08-01,5,What else is there to say??? Delicious!
357358,24672,2009-10-13,5,"Lovely! The only thing I did differently was to add 1 TBL Grand Marnier (orange liqueur) to the strawberries and slice them thinly so that they stretched a bit further. We found this a bit on the sweet side, but that was probably due to the pre-made angel food cake. Next time I will only use 1/2 cup 10x sugar. This ""shortcake"" method would also be excellent with peaches and cinnamon. Thanks!"
198154,24672,2010-06-21,5,"I made this using fat free cream cheese and fat free whipped topping, but don't tell! I never mentioned it and no one could tell.  I took it to the in laws for a father's day cook out.  The plates all came back clean.  I think it's safe to say it was enjoyed by all."
264017,24672,2011-06-29,5,We loved this! I used Splenda instead of granulated sugar and layered it into a trifle dish. It made an awesome presentation! I just scooped up servings with a large spoon. We had smiles all around the table.
126440,24672,2012-05-08,5,Made half a recipe and used sponge cake.  Excellent!
620763,24672,2013-05-27,5,"This is a great, light summery dessert. I followed directions given, only I used a smaller pan so it would be thicker. Came out great! Mine cut perfectly into squares. My kids made a flag pattern on the top using strawberries and blueberries."
60260,28603,2003-09-30,5,Oh yeah!! I just bought my candy corn and peanuts today and it's great!  It does taste more like Salted Nut Roll to me but who cares - it's yummy!  I really have never liked candy corn but buy it for dh - I'm afraid we're going to have to battle for them now!  Try it!
7108,28603,2003-10-30,5,Not a candy corn fan either but this mix is delish!  I used Indian corn (brownish candy corn; tastes the same).
133174,28603,2004-09-20,5,"I use to make this for Girl Scouts.  It was a big hit.  How can you go wrong--mix, stir and eat.  Wonderful!"
104295,28603,2004-10-02,5,"One of my aerobics instructors was talking about this a week or so ago, and then I saw this posted and started thinking about it.  I had told my husband and so he bought the supplies this morning (though he got unsalted peanuts) and it is wonderful!  Originally when I had told him that it tasted like a Baby Ruth he didn't believe me.  But one bite and he said ""It does!""  Addictive stuff!!  "
101823,28603,2004-10-02,5,"My husband is in heaven.  Salted Nut rolls are one of his favorite candy bars.  I think that if I added M&M's (for the chocolate), it would be more like a Baby Ruth.  Still, a winner here.  Thanks for posting.  "
42720,28603,2004-10-04,5,"With all the great reviews, I had to try this.  I used the dry roasted peanuts and I bought a mixture of the Brach's candy corn and candy pumpkins.  Really colorful!  I filled up a candy bowl with this and took it to work.  Everyone raved about it.  Thanks for such a simple but yummy recipe!
"
56087,28603,2004-10-06,5,"Made this today for one of our offices when they had a incredibly bad day.. It was SO good, I didn't want to give it away.. This will become a tradition in my home.. and I don't even like candy corn.. but this different."
47907,28603,2004-10-10,5,I took this to my daughter's sorority's Parents Weekend party and it was a big hit.  I had to wrestle it away from my daughter!  The combination is just terrific and the recipe couldn't be simpler.  It is definately a keeper.  Thanks for  posting the recipe!!!!
146486,28603,2004-10-12,5,I'll add my rave review in with all the others.  I made this last weekend to take to a tailgate party and we all loved it.  I added M&M's to it and it did taste just like a baby ruth!!
13796,28603,2004-10-23,5,I put this in cute little jars and gave one to my sister and took some to the ladies at work. They loved it!
124249,28603,2005-09-16,5,"Made this snack mix for a family get together. Everyone liked it. they thought it tasted like a salted nut roll.

Thanks for such a good and easy recipe. Bullwinkle"
229850,28603,2006-06-09,5,Have been makin this for about 4 years. Reminds us of a payday candy bar. Yummy!
22015,28603,2006-07-21,5,I don't like candy corn but a friend told me about this tasting like a payday candy bar so I had to try it.   It works!   It really does taste like a Payday.  Now I buy candy corn just so I can make this.
172369,28603,2007-01-16,5,"This is so good and so easy, Very adicting! I will be making this for a treat for myself, it just can't be beat.Thanks for posting. Reminds me of a payday."
131021,28603,2007-08-15,5,"I was never a big fan of candy corn and could always pass by it in the store. Now I can't, my sister got me started on this stuff and I can't wait to get the really fresh candy corn at the beginning of the season."
185285,28603,2007-09-06,5,"This is such a pleasant surprise! It tastes a bit like a crunchy version of the bit-o-honey candies. DH and I both loved it (I like sweet, he likes salty)"
142559,28603,2007-10-25,5,"This combination is so good!  We've been making this for a while now in the office, tastes JUST like a Payday candy bar! LOVE IT!!!"
132383,28603,2007-11-10,5,I have been making this for gifts for years...love it!  Taste like a payday candy bar.
369715,28603,2008-09-26,5,"Made this for my son's cub scout meeting, a batch for home and a batch for on my desk at work.  Everyone enjoyed this mixture! This was easy to put together. I followed the recipe as written. Made for Fall PAC 2008."
400708,28603,2008-11-28,5,"Made this for when the DGSs were visiting but it was enjoyed by all and truly did taste like a Payday, thanks Kim for a fun and easy recipe"
140132,28603,2009-03-02,5,We make this every fall.  DH's grandma always has this in her candy dish.  The combo of salty peanuts and sweet candy corn are a perfect match.  I think it tastes like a salted nut roll.  Thank you for posting.
198154,28603,2010-03-09,4,"A store clerk asked me if I liked PayDay candy bars when I was buying a bag of candy corn.  He told me to get a can of salted peanuts and mix them a ratio of 4 peanuts to 1 candy corn.  Hmmm, not bad!  Forgot about it until I saw your recipe.  Thanks for the post!"
32058,28603,2011-09-03,5,Doesn't get easier than this but nothing says fall like it!  Wonderful contrast.  Add some halloween M&M's for an extra special treat.
121185,68159,2004-10-04,5,Oh YUM!  These were so tasty and the house smelled awesome while roasting the garlic!  I used light sour cream and fat free half n' half - WOW!  Delicious!
44383,68159,2004-10-16,4,"Made these for our Thanksgiving dinner last week.  No rave reviews but they were easy and for someone who hates making mashed potatoes, this is a good recipe to go back to again and again. "
52543,68159,2004-11-15,5,"I'm so glad that I bought a ""ricer"" & made this recipe - it was fantastic! I used Yukon Gold potatoes & my own Roasted Garlic (recipe #805450 which involves a little white wine. Thanx Mimi!"
47907,68159,2004-12-08,5,All I can say is excellent!  These were so good ~ I may make them again tonight!  I made the recipe exactly as posted.  The potatoes were wonderfully garlicky and nice and creamy.  Thank you for posting ~ it's a keeper!
4470,68159,2005-03-20,5," I will add my applause to this recipe - Excellent flavor I love the roasted garlic. I mixed the mashed garlic, sour cream & buttert together and kept it at room temperature so all I had to do after draining the potatoes was to put the mixture in mash and season. -- posted Nov 18, 2004  This time I used the scooped out innards from potatoes that I used for Potato skins and it worked perfectly - I baked the miture for 30 minutes at 350F It was great, some crisp bits an looked golden
"
132383,68159,2005-06-06,5,Loved it - thanks!
125640,68159,2006-01-22,2,"Just made these to go with My Family's Favorite Sloppy Joes by Hey Jude and sorry to say we were dissapointed; certainly not 'the best we've ever had'; in fact, that was DH's response to the whole meal 'Sorry to say, not your best meal ever'. These had too much garlic (I usually quadrouple the amount of garlic in a recipe, but as written the flavor in this was over the top) and they didn't have enough butter. I would recommend usuing cream instead of milk as I used milk thinking the sour cream and butter would make them rich and creamy, but I guess there just wasn't enough of either to do much good in 2 lbs of potatoes. And just so people know, this recipe makes a ton of mashed potatoes, far more than necessary for 4 people as a side dish."
230557,68159,2006-02-23,5,Very yummy - and we love garlic so much that I may even use 2 heads next time. Thanks for a simple and good basic recipe.
357358,68159,2006-11-23,5,Excellent. This came out sooooo much better than those boxed or bagged mixes. There is no substitute for the fresh garlic. My handheld blender worked just fine to whip these up (I do not have a ricer). I think plain Idaho potatoes would work just fine too. I am going to add some diced onion and fry some patties up for breakfast tomorrow! Thanks Mimi.
347822,68159,2006-11-24,4,Very good.
359220,68159,2006-11-24,4,"Very delish!  The potatoes were creamy, smooth and rich.  I think the bulb of garlic I used was too small though, so I'll increase the roasted garlic next time.  The family loved these with bacon cream gravy...Thanks Mimi!"
89831,68159,2006-11-27,5,"YUMMMMM!!! so good, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten :)"
333017,68159,2006-12-26,4,"These potatoes turned out really well!!!  Because I had more potatoes, I added a bit more sour cream and some cream cheese to the mix.  I made these for Christmas and I liked the fact that I could make them ahead of time and just re-heat.  I highly recommend these!"
103876,68159,2007-01-01,5,The garlic in these potatoes was the hit!  They turned out with just the right amount of flavor.  Thanks for posting.
248023,68159,2007-07-24,4,"Very creamy, silky and buttery mashed potatoes!  There are only two of us, so I halved the recipe, but used the full amount of roasted garlic since we love it. I cooked the potatoes in salted water for about 15 minutes and then added the olive oil and only about 2 TBS of butter... I realized I didn't have any sour cream, so I just left it out and whipped them up using some organic 2% milk.  Still very fluffy and tasty!!!  A great recipe... A must try if you love your spuds!!!  Thanks for posting!"
185285,68159,2007-12-12,5,".....And Wha-La: Another fantastic review for these little gems.  Happy 100th!  I much prefer the taste of roasted garlic in potatoes. It's milder and does not overpower the main dish in any way. I skinnied up the recipe a bit by using FF Sour Cream and Smart Balance Butter, so no additional milk was needed b/c we like our potatoes thick! Perfect recipe, Thanks!"
140132,68159,2007-12-12,5,100 stars....very good
808027,68159,2008-06-09,5,"OH MY GAWD!  These are off the chart incredible!!!  If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these potatoes.  I also put the roasted garlic through the ricer.  Restaurant quality.  Thank you so much for submitting this awesome recipe."
182624,68159,2008-11-04,0,"We loved these, but I'm a firm believer that if you significantly change something about a recipe you shouldn't rate it unless it's five stars.  I would easily give this four, though, even though I used red potatoes, didn't use a ricer and mashed them by hand.  But they were still great!  Roasting garlic is so easy and adds a nice subtle flavor.  I plan on making these again and look forward to trying the recipe as stated - thanks!"
140806,68159,2008-11-24,5,These really ARE the best garlic mashed potatoes I've ever had! My DH loaded up on the garlic...but I could have done a little less. Ricing the garlic and potatoes works wonders. We added a bit of whole milk to smooth out the texture. Served with homemade gravy. So yummy!
126440,68159,2008-11-28,5,This recipe was great with our Thanksgiving dinner.  I had two helpings.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
195589,68159,2009-03-27,5,I LOVE these potatoes! I made them for a dinner party once and one of the guests was a chef from the Culinary Institute. (gulp) He raved about them. I always leave the skin on my potatoes no matter what kind I use and use the old-fashioned hand-held masher. I have also subsituted Boursin Cheese for the sour cream with excellent results. Thanks for posting.
937635,68159,2009-12-15,5,"Perfect! I used Chef #669074's roasting instructions for the garlic and wow, what a great way to skip the gooey I'm used to. The best way to make mashed potatoes, bar none. I made a beef stew yesterday and put it over these tonight and it was heavenly! Thanks, Mimi and Chef #669074"
189616,68159,2010-05-08,5,"Superb spuds!
Thank You for sharing this gem of a recipe"
305531,68159,2011-01-10,5,Yummy potatoes. This was really simple and delicious. Thanks Mimi for a nice keeper. Made for Cookbook Tag.
145352,68159,2011-07-05,5,Very good! MMMM
37449,68159,2014-01-30,5,"Yum, goody good. Made for Best of 2013 game."
68960,108105,2005-03-22,5,"Great recipe - I used boneless, skinless thighs chopped into cubes and didn't have the snap peas so instead used green onions. For our personal taste I did increase the fish sauce to 1 tablespoon and also the chilli to 1 teaspoon. This recipe doesn't creat much sauce, more a coating for the chicken. Top marks for a quick and easy dinner. Thanks MarieAlice!"
37449,108105,2005-10-18,5,"Fabulous! It looked yummy and my DH really loved it! Easy and quick, this is a winner! Thank you MaryAlice! I'm glad you were in my group for Photo Swap#4!"
52543,108105,2005-10-25,5,"I'm so glad that I paid heed to Carla's ""Public Service Announcement"" and made this dish! Its quick & easy, perfect for a weeknight meal, but special enough to serve to company.
I omitted the snap peas as they're difficult to find in Canada at this time of year. I paired it with Thai Noodles With Spicy Peanut Sauce (#99918) made with frozen mixed Thai style veggies. Thanx MarieAlice - we will enjoy this another day! "
222433,108105,2006-02-10,5,Very good! I doubled the sauce recipe because I used 5 large chicken breasts from Costco. The small amount that was left after dinner was cut up and and thrown into the leftover noodles with spicy peanut sauce the next day. My kids loved it!
207176,108105,2007-01-25,5,This was very nice! I liked it a lot and the kids did too.  I used a whole bag of skinless boneless flash frozen thighs from Trader Joe's and had enough flour coating and sauce.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces for this and I sprinkled with chopped scallions before serving. It was tangy for sure and we served it with rice too.  Thanks for a different chicken dish!
255338,108105,2007-01-26,5,Nice blend of flavors. We enjoyed this dish very much and will be making this again. Only change I did was to use rice vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar because that was what we had. Thank you for posting.
312577,108105,2007-02-11,5,Absolutely fantastic recipe.  I am very happy with this recipe.  I feel that this is a better than restaurant dish.  I found it easy to make.  I did cut the chicken into pieces instead of keeping the breasts whole.  My dish ended up looking like Trishypie's and it was delicious!
402559,108105,2007-02-12,3,Not lacking any flavor that is for sure. We just didn't particularly care for the flavor and found it to be a bit overwhelming. But I will try this again making some adjustments to tone it down some. Thanks!
520150,108105,2007-07-14,5,This was just wonderful!  I have been instructed by my dh to keep this recipe close at hand.  Thank you very much for a recipe we are sure to make again & again.
316717,108105,2007-07-16,5,i loved this. my family on the other hand claimed flavor was too strong. maybe for them i'll cut back on the ginger  and for sure use lite soy sauce.
55729,108105,2007-09-05,4,"I thought the flavor of the sauce was outstanding, and the chicken was pretty good. The chicken did not stay as crisp as I had hoped."
39301,108105,2007-09-16,5,This was good. My husband even requested that we try the sauce with beef sometime because he was quite fond of it. I browned the chicken breasts on each side and then finished them off in the oven to keep them moist and it turned out beautifully. Thanks for posting.
280271,108105,2007-12-18,5,Oh my goodness is this a great recipe! I'm so glad I came across this dish. Just like all the other reviewers this is a recipe that you must make. 10+ stars from us. I prepared it as posted no changes needed. Served it with rice and recipe #107749. Excellent meal. One of the best that I have come across here at zaar! This will be  made again no doubt about it. Thanks ever so much MarieAlice for posting.
199020,108105,2008-04-08,5,"So good, and so easy!  I used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and added steamed broccoli.  I used the extra sauce to stir fry the noodles.  Thanks!"
774665,108105,2008-04-27,5,We devoured this chicken! I'd like to be interesting and say I changed a bunch of things but I didn't change one thing! This will be made a lot in our home from now on! Thanks for posting a keeper!
158086,108105,2008-08-05,5,great recipe....we enjoyed it and I am glad I doubled the sauce...
489552,108105,2009-01-26,5,"This was so good and very easy to make.  I didn't have sugar snap peas, but I think I didn't miss anything w/out them.  Served this with rice, steamed veggies.
Excellent!"
142335,108105,2009-05-25,4,Very good and moist. I used two breasts but kept the recipe the same for the sauce. To save time I prepped all the sauce ingredients while the chicken was cooking. Quick and easy enough for a weeknight meal.
91392,108105,2009-06-03,5,"Super!, a real winner! I used rice wine vinegar and the fish sauce.  A real keeper.  Don't be afraid of fish sauce, it isn't nasty or fishy in a recipe like this."
160974,108105,2009-06-11,5,"My husband and I loved it. The sauce is perfect!  I used a few tbs. less b. sugar and used oyster sauce. I served over arborio rice. Thanks MarieAlice, for posting.
Roxygirl"
126440,108105,2010-05-11,5,Awesome chicken.  I made half a recipe and served with Recipe #202678.  DH said one of the best meals we have had.
1269015,108105,2010-09-12,4,"I made this with tofu and was pretty impressed - I like the flavors of the sauce, although the ginger was a bit overpowering for me. Thanks for sharing!"
140132,108105,2010-10-02,5,"Oh, this was so delicious!  I made this and wasn't sure about the vinegary sauce to top it with but it was so good.  We loved it and the only thing wrong with it was that we didn't double the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us it was delicious!!!"
218535,108105,2012-04-23,4,Too sour for us so I'll be using only 1/4 cup of vinegar the next time.
400708,108105,2013-12-13,5,"Oh my these are so good.  Just the right mix of sweet and spicy.  I did use thighs instead of breast as that&#039;s what I had and besides I like them better and cut them into chunks so they&#039;d cook faster and the spices could get through them easier.  Turned out with just the right mix of sweet and spicy, and the sauce is to die for.  It&#039;s going to be a favorite of mine.  I think it&#039;d be perfect served over steamed rice, I had Thai Rice Cakes left over so used that as a side."
285039,108105,2014-07-07,5,"I grilled the chicken and prepared the sauce separately, adding about 1 T. of cornstarch to thicken.  I served over an Asian salad.  It was delicious!"
265954,108105,2016-06-06,5,"Very good. I took advice from other reviewers and cut up the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces and doubled the sauce. Also, I find that chicken breast can get dry and tough when fried, so I changed the cooking procedure to this recipe by first sauteing the chicken pieces and then adding the remaining ingredients directly into the frying pan with the chicken still in the pan. I boiled down the sauce and stirred the chicken in the sauce frequently. That worked out well, as the chicken pieces absorbed some of the sauce and were fork-tender when done. My kids and husband asked me to make this recipe again. There is something missing to this sauce, though--maybe pineapple or orange juice? I'll be making this again and will find out. I served this meal with white rice and black beans (the Goya recipe on the back of the Goya black beans can; it's the best black bean recipe). I will use this recipe often!"
28649,96988,2004-09-22,3,"This chicken was very easy to make but we thought it was rather bland tasting.  It also wasn't that moist, maybe my crockpot cooks a little quicker and I over cooked it I don't know.  It smelled great but we weren't that impressed with it.  Sorry."
59780,96988,2004-09-09,5,"MMMmmmm! What a great easy recipe. I started my University classes again today but also wanted to have my parents over for my mom's birthday. I put 2 chickens into my large crockpot and used 1/2 cup of the liquid smoke. I put crockpot stuffing recipe#49609 in my other crockpot added a few sides and served Autumn Apple Pie for dessert recipe#72672. We ate very well and I did not spend all day slaving over a stove. The chicken was so moist and tender. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
"
68460,96988,2004-09-13,5,"Add me to the 5* list, this was wonderful! Came out juicy with, believe or not, almost crispy skin. I cooked it for 10 hours and we had it with HeatherFeather's Lightened Scalloped Potatoes, recipe #97648, and some corn....perfect combo!  Effortless dinner, priceless.  Thanks BobbieGirl for making my life easier tonight :)"
13796,96988,2004-09-21,5,I thought this was pretty good... and sure was easy enough. After I took the chicken out of the crock pot I refrigerated the liquid and the next day skimmed off all the fat. That tasty liquid is now frozen awaiting my next pot of spicy black bean soup!
60992,96988,2004-09-23,5,Hail the genius TBG!!!!!! This is way too good to be true! I cannot believe that this was SO simple and SO good! I seasoned my bird with garlic powder and some seasoning salt before I poured the liquid smoke over and turned on the crockpot! I will make this every chance I get. Not only is the chicken incredibly moist and just lightly smoky tasting but making gravy from the drippings is super! How would have thought something that takes all of 2 minutes to throw in the crockpot could be so gosh darn fantastic! Another Zaar MUST try recipe!
32058,96988,2004-09-23,5,OMG!  This is DELICIOUS and oh so easy!  I too have the concentrated smoke and used about 2 teaspoons only.  I cooked all day and it was out of this world!  Whole family LOVED it!  THANKS a MILLION!
47907,96988,2004-09-25,5,"Wonderful recipe!  It's so simple and the result tastes like I fussed all day.  Even my ""I hate smoke flavor"" daughter loved it.  I will be making again and again.  Thank you for posting!"
36944,96988,2004-09-29,5,"I used six large boneless, skinless chicken breasts that were partially frozen.  I poured the 1/4 cup liquid smoke over them as the recipe stated, then I poured about 1/8 cup worcestershire sauce over them.  I cooked them on high approximately 3 hours.  They were falling apart tender.  So simple.  ThatBobbieGirl, I thank you for sharing such a simple recipe for a delicious entree.   "
54678,96988,2004-10-03,2,I didn't have enought liquid smoke so used half worster sauce - my chicken was about 5 lbs and was mush when done -even the bones were mush which made deboning for children's sake a hazard cuz it completely fell apart like no other bird I've done and yet the breast meat was dry so guess it was definitely overcooked. Sorry but would not smoke again like this but stick to the original smoking methods.
39301,96988,2004-10-19,4,This is so simple... you have to love it.  I used a 1/2 cup of smoke: 1/4 in the cavity and 1/4 in the pot.  I also found that I needed to add some kosher salt toward the end for a little extra flavor.  The result was great and the leftovers were even better.
60989,96988,2004-10-26,4,"This was good and easy to make. I rubbed some onion powder and garlic powder under the over the skin and tucked a onion inside the bird. The amount of juice was amazing and I had to pour some of it out half way through. It wa very moist and tender after 10 hours and as many others reported, fell off the bone.
Thanks! "
7108,96988,2004-10-31,5,"This was really good!  I used an entire bottle of Liquid Smoke and also added some garlic powder and seasoning salt to the chicken. I cooked it for 10 hours. I tried to pick it up out of the pot to place it on a plate to take the meat off and couldn't because the meat fell off the bone, so tender!  This made a great supper for my low carb diet and I can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow served over a salad.  Thanks for posting!"
13483,96988,2004-12-29,5,What a unique and creative way to cook an old bird!!  This was marvellous!!  And the defatted sauce made a terrific gravy!  Love these simple but fabulous recipes!!
177933,96988,2005-02-02,3,"I would use this method again just to cook the chicken and use the meat for another recipe, but I didn't care for the flavor much.  Maybe I am just spoiled from having smoked chicken cooked on an actual smoker.  My husband has a true southern style pit that we cook on all summer, it's the best!"
37868,96988,2005-05-19,4,Very Easy!! I cooked this for my next door neighbors for dinner. They love it..I love it. Thank You so very much for a tasty easy chicken. Hugs
173579,96988,2005-06-16,5,My family thought this recipe was very good!  The only thing I done different was use Paul's Seasoning Mix #106428 to rub on it before I put it in the crockpot.  The smokey flavor comes out in it the next day even more.  Can't beat this recipe!  Thanks for posting.
39835,96988,2005-08-02,4,Very good chicken and one of the only successful ways I've made chicken in a crockpot--and so easy too! Thanks for sharing!
32772,96988,2005-08-24,5,"You out did yourself with this recipe. I was very much surprized by the reviews that this chicken was bland. It not only had a wonderful smoke flavor but it just fell right off the bones. I cooked a 7 1/2 pound chicken in my Rival Slow Cooker on Low for 10 hours. Yes, I couldn't just pick up the whole chicken to remove it from my slow cooker because it just fell apart. I found this to be a good thing.  My whole family loved it. I served it with Cream Cheese Mashed Potatoes and made a chicken gravy. I didn't think I would like the smoke flavor from the drippings for my gravy so I just cheated and used a packet of chicken gravy. There is no need to add extra broth or water because the chicken does make its own. Compared to oven cooking where the moisture escapes this isn't the case in slow cooking. This is why there is a little more fat in the drippings but the problem can be solved by just skimming off the top. The best way to remove fat from soups and other recipes is take a large lettuce leaf and run it across the top of the broth. Instantly the fat is gone. Next time and I mean there will be a next time, I will use a BBG rub to change it up a little. Thanks for posting."
176615,96988,2005-10-08,3,"Great idea but my expectations may have been a bit high. The chicken turned out moist but very bland. I used a whole chicken and maybe more liquid smoke or salt would have helped. I'll use the leftovers for chicken salad, though, which I think will be quite nice. Thanks, TBG, for sharing your recipe!"
218535,96988,2007-09-30,3,Not a fan of the recipe. The chicken was tender but not much flavor. The smoke smell is overpowering.
355637,96988,2008-10-16,3,"This was good. The skin of the chicken ended up a little crispy, which was maybe due to overcooking? Either way, the taste was very good."
226863,96988,2008-10-26,3,"I'd really like to do 3 1/2 stars...the chicken prepared as listed was bland.  I added the salt, but I wish I had added more seasoning and stuck an onion & lemon into the cavity.  The smell is wonderful, and I'm hoping that the leftovers will be great in sandwiches and salads.  I may have been expecting too much because of all the reviews...I love grilled and smoked chicken, but this crockpot version just didn't measure up.  Sorry.  Made for Alphabet Soup Tag."
350750,96988,2010-03-07,5,"My husband said this was good.  Next time I'll add more seasonings, thanks for a different recipe!"
98919,96988,2010-08-15,5,"Three words sum up this recipe:  TO-DIE-FOR!!!!  So good!!!  I sprayed the crockpot with cooking spray, put 1 1/2 large onions, sliced, on bottom of the crock, then added the chicken that I had coated well with kosher salt,coarsely ground pepper and McCormick's 'Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning'.  (Rubbed some of the salt & pepper under the skin of the breast and also sprinkled inside the cavity).  Used about 1 or 2 T. Worcestershire Sauce 1/4 c. hickory flavored liquid smoke, 1/4 c. water and then squeezed 1/2 a lemon over top and then stuffed it into the cavity. Cooked on LOW for 12 hours.  YUM-O!!!  Thanks for this wonderful cooking technique ThatBobbieGirl!!  It's a keeper.  NOTE:  This was not overly ""smoky"" or bland at all!"
140132,96988,2010-10-30,4,"This worked out well.  I added some chopped onion to the bottom of the crockpot and them rubbed some Famous Daves Chicken seasoning along with poultry seasoning on the outside of the chicken as well as the cavity.  I let it cook for seven hours and it was too long, next time I will check at six hours, but didn't make much difference to us, we enjoyed this chicken anyway.  Thank you for sharing."
369715,96988,2011-07-18,4,I only had about an 1/8 cup of liquid smoke and then added 1/8 cup of water. We thought that was perfect. It does make the house smell good while cooking. I seasoned my chicken with a lot of seasoning and thought the smoke gave it just a bit of smoke taste. I cooked mine on high for four hours and it was perfect. We all enjoyed this.
198154,96988,2012-10-30,4,"Super easy to do,  I used a rosemary garlic rub, but I think a cajun rub would be even better.  I put it in the crock pot in the morning and had dinner waiting when we got home after a long day.  Served with red new potatoes and roasted corn."
377581,137911,2008-05-02,5,Yum! This was delicious! It had a nice rich taste. I made brussel sprouts to go with it. The left overs cooked up well and didn't lose any of the wonderful taste. Thanks for posting. My family loved this!
60989,68955,2004-02-08,4,"This was a hit. So fast to make, I thought it smelled great while cooking, and practically error proof. We will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing! "
92886,68955,2004-02-24,4,"I just had to see what everyone was raving about.  And I found that it really is a great dish.  I used skinless leg quarters, but did everything else exactly as directed.  I probably cooked it for a total of 30 to 35 minutes.  I think the peppper added an excellent additon to the dish.  My husband even said it was really good (unsolicited!).  I am adding it to my keeper file."
47559,68955,2004-02-29,4,"I loved how simple and flavorful this recipe was.  Next time, I will brown the chicken first, and use low sodium soy sauce.  DH and I both thought it was just a bit too salty (and we like salt).  I used a nice fat jalapeno pepper, and that was great.  It took about 15 minutes to reduce the sauce, after the initial boil, until it was sticky - no thickening needed.  I served it on a bed of jasmine rice and topped with chopped green onion.  We also had tender/crisp green beans on the side.  A meal worth repeating."
37636,68955,2004-05-15,4,"This has a good flavor that reminds me of a teriyaki sauce. The chicken was very tender, but slightly dry from the cooking time required to reduce the sauce to a glaze. Next time I will watch more closely to see when the chicken gets done and remove it while reducing the sauce (add back in at the end). This recipe is so simple to make, I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for posting!"
55578,68955,2004-07-02,5,"It's great!!!My whole family loved it!  I used Splenda, as always, and I would brown the chicken ahead of time as suggested.  It is such a rich tasting recipe.  Thanks!"
103876,68955,2004-08-09,5,"Here's another WOW!  This was so easy to make and tastes great.  I am already thinking about what I can make next with this glaze.  I think I will try chicken breasts cut up in chunks.  I was wondering if the sauce would actually turn into a sticky glaze as it took a while for it to boil down, but it did work and turned out beautiful.  Thanks for a great new recipe!"
54678,68955,2004-08-19,5,"So easy , so quick, so kid friendly and so tasty."
101034,68955,2004-08-24,5,"Very good indeed!!! I didn't change a thing. I still can't get over how simple this was, but yet so delicious. Next time I think I'll try making it with wings. Thanks Jan for a great one. "
146047,68955,2004-09-03,5,"Geez, there are already 72 reviews, but heck, I wanna throw my hat into the ring too:  This is great!  Salty, sweet, savory, sticky goodness.  I made this with skinless chicken breasts.  Chicken breasts will tend to dry out easily so first I brought the sauce to a boil and simmered for 15 minutes, then added my pieces of chicken, chopped into large pieces.  I simmered on low for about 15 minutes, then removed the chicken so I could thicken the sauce by further simmering (and the addition of a thickener called xanthan gum).  This way the chicken didn't get overcooked.  Lovely dish over white basmati rice and with a garlicky zucchini-mushroom stir-fry.  File this under ""keep me forever""."
95743,68955,2004-09-18,0,"I tried this using Splenda and chicken breasts.  I wanted plenty of sauce so I doubled that part of the recipe.  I only cooked the 1"" chicken cubes about 15 minutes until cooked through. I simmered and boiled the sauce down for over two hours and it never really got to the point of being sticky.  It would have, given enough time, but by then the sauce was so salty it was nearly inedible.  I don't recommend you do any of the things I tried."
37036,68955,2004-09-21,5,"WOW!!! These are awesome!  I've had this recipe in my cookbook for a long time and my only regret is that I didn't give them a try sooner! I used chicken wings instead of drumsticks.  For the pepper, I used one Penzey's Tein Tsin Chili Pepper.  DH thought I should have used more peppers to make it hotter, but I thought it was great as it was.  I covered the skillet for the first 20 minutes while simmering.  I removed the lid and increased the temperature until the sauce reduced to a glaze.  I served the wings over white rice and the family raved over dinner! Thanks Jan, Tomoko and Toshiko for sharing a great recipe! "
121185,68955,2004-09-22,5,"Really VERY good!  My entire family of 4 loved this dish.  I did make some changes though...I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (instead of the pepper) and about 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to help speed up the thickening of the sauce.  I cooked the chicken as directed until it was done (about 10-15 minutes), removed the chicken and continued to cook the sauce for another 10 minutes, finally adding the cornstarch because we were just too hungry to wait any longer!  I served the chicken over rice with the sauce drizzled on top - YUM!!!"
39301,68955,2004-10-19,5,"I'm just adding my voice to the masses with this review, but I had to say how much we enjoy this chicken.  It is absolutely wonderful and so easy to make!  A definite household staple recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing it here."
42720,68955,2004-10-25,5,"Jan this recipe is incredible!  I can't believe I waited so long to try it.  I used thighs instead of legs since I had them on hand and there were 8 of them. I had to use my largest skillet to get them all in.  Followed your ingredients for the sauce exactly as written except I didn't have a whole pepper so I put in 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it provided the right amount of flavor for us.  Because I used thighs, I let them simmer 30 minutes.  They were very tender at that point so I removed them while the sauce was turning to glaze then put them back into the glaze for about 5 minutes.  Absolutely delightful and my family loved the taste.  I served lo mein noodles with oriental veggies on the side.  Great oriental meal and definitely a keeper!  Thanks!"
13796,68955,2004-11-21,5,Ok.. I'll be number 109 on the review list. This was very good. I used thighs. I was first going to give it 4 stars because I thought it was waaaay too salty..   But after reading the recipe again I saw that I omitted the SUGAR!! DUH..!! That would have made all the difference. That bit of sweetness would have balanced the salty taste.  So.. allow me to add my FIVE STAR review. (Not that it needs any more reviews). Simple.. easy.. and like some of the other reviewers I think I'll try wings next time. Maybe for a football game appetizer doubling the sauce ingredients.
68960,68955,2004-12-27,5,"I have not cooked this myself but were lucky enough to be at the Zaar Aussie Christmas Party '04 and were able to try this tasty recipe. Dave couldn't stop eating these and made sure he sat right in front of them! Thanks Jan, Dave intends to make them for us very soon!!"
28649,68955,2004-12-27,5,What more can be said that hasn't been said in the other 112 reviews.  Delicious and simple to make.  My youngest gave it 100 thousand thumbs up.  The kids were quite during dinner for the first time in a long time.  I used chicken thighs and can't wait to try this on wings or legs next.  Thanks Jan for a wonderul recipe.
9869,68955,2004-12-28,5,"I was still recuperating from the big Christmas cook out and wanted something easy peasy to try, this recipe had been in my hopper for awhile and fitted the bill perfectly.
I also used chicken thighs and served it with coconut rice recipe #79436.
Really tasty, thanks Jan and Tomoko."
132764,68955,2005-01-01,5,"I must admit, based on reviews and personal taste, we altered this a bit. I used my oversized electric skillet and browned the thighs before pouring the sauce over them. Also, I didn't have a pepper, so I used a combo of sweet chili sauce and cayenne to give it heat. I omitted the sugar (because of the sweet chili sauce) but after tasting it, the SO decided to add some brown sugar for sweetness and depth. I think having such a wide pan helped it evaporate and the sauce was sticky and wonderful! This is NOT your anything you can get in a bottle!! We'll do this over and over again I'm sure! Thanks for sharing this. "
180090,68955,2005-01-29,5,"Really tasty chicken! While making it I was worried that it would taste too much like the balsamic vinegar, since it smelled strong while cooking it, but the flavor in the end was sooo perfect! I forgot to buy the chili pepper, so I used a tsp of red pepper flakes and it turned out great. Leftovers of the sauce looked kinda nasty before heating up because the fat separated and it was like jelly, but once heated it was fine."
68460,68955,2005-02-19,5,"I've had this recipe in my 'to do' file for a while and finally did it tonight.  We loved it!  I made as written, using a pack of 10 chicken legs, so I increased the sauce amounts a bit.  I served it with steamed Japanese (short-grain) rice and glazed carrots.  My family really enjoyed this, especially my Japanese husband.  Thanks so much Jan, this will be made again in my house :)"
7108,68955,2005-03-23,5,"Another 5 stars!  I'm on South Beach, so I used Equal sugar substitute for the sugar (3 packets).  It took exactly 45 minutes to cook/for sauce to thicken to a sticky glaze.  Being on the South Beach diet, I usually have to cook 2 separate dinners for myself and family; with this recipe, I was able to cook 1 main dish so this worked out perfectly.  I served this with green beans...and they had chicken with garlic rice also.  Thanks for posting!"
132383,68955,2005-04-03,5,Loved this recipe and really appreciate you posting it.  We were tired and wanted to make something simple and this fit the bill.  We only used five drum sticks since there are only two of us. We mixed the white rice with theleftover sauce before serving and it was delicious.
188119,68955,2005-04-28,5,"It's pretty good, but I don't really see how it is japanese food.  Oh well, doesn't matter.. still good =)"
64934,68955,2005-05-30,5,"I've had this in my cook book for months and have finally got around to making it!  I'm only sorry I didn't try it sooner, after tasting it.   Wonderful!  I had 12 drumsticks, so I doubled the sauce.  The only change I made was to use Splenda in place of the sugar but the taste was still great!  Served this with basmati rice (and poured some of the glaze over the rice), as well as steamed broccoli!   Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe, Jan... and thanks to your Japenese friends too! "
60992,68955,2005-06-02,5,"This has recieved this many good reviews for a reason!!! It tastes great!!! It is very easy to make as well! My daughter walked in the house and said ""yum, teriyaki!"", and it did remind me of teriyaki, only much much better! I will make this a staple from now on!"
22015,68955,2005-11-14,4,I used thighs and this worked out nicely.   I made sticky rice which we topped with some of the glaze and steamed broccoli.   It made an easy and tasty week night meal.   Thank you for posting it.
125640,68955,2005-12-22,3,"This was pretty good, but I don't think it will become a regular dinner in our house. It was easy, except for getting the fat seperated from the sauce. That part turned out to be kind of difficult and time consuming. The chicken was tender and the flavor had a nice little kick, but it was a bit to vinegary for us."
55729,68955,2006-01-31,5,"This was wonderful! I was wondering when the sauce would turn into a glaze, when, ""boom!"" it did.. I thought the flavor was great and it didn't require too much fuss. (I also didn't find it greasy at all.)"
142335,68955,2006-02-13,5,"Awesome! I served this with fried rice. No left overs, darn it."
142367,68955,2006-07-09,4,"My kids declared this one a ""keeper.""  My husband and I enjoyed this too, but it didn't knock our socks off, so I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Very easy and good though."
218535,68955,2006-07-12,5,Wonderful! My family devoured it. It's easy and delicious. Definitely a keeper.
255338,68955,2006-10-10,5,"5 Stars for taste and ease of preparation. We like things spicier, so next time will add a tad more chili. Thank you for posting."
362983,68955,2006-10-23,5,"These were AMAZING! I've never cooked with balsamic vinegar before so I was scared that it would overpower all the other ingredients, but after the sauce cooked down (mine needed just a tiny bit of cornstarch to thicken it more) and I had a quick taste, it was to die for! Sweet but it has that little kick from the vinegar and chilis. I'm definitely making this again!"
13483,68955,2006-12-04,5,"I don't know why it took me so long to do this recipe (been in my ""to do"" list for ages). Now that the wait is over, I'll be doing this for company often!!  It is good!!!  I did have to thicken up the sauce with some conrstarch however.  Great way to do chicken.  Thanks JanRoundOz."
140132,68955,2006-12-15,4,"Simple , but tasted complex.  We love the balsamic vinegar, really makes this dish.  Thanks for an easy chicken dish.....Stephanie"
182624,68955,2007-01-07,4,"This was a very tasty, relatively healthy and easy to prepare chicken.  It took quite some time for the sauce to become a glaze, which is okay since you really don't have to do much other than turn the chicken at that stage.  Definitely a keeper recipe!"
394077,68955,2007-01-27,3,It is a good recipe but nothing extraordinary to me.  Easy to make though.
158086,68955,2007-02-25,5,Add me to the list of lovers of this recipe....i used boneless chicken thighes and my company devoured all of it...
185446,68955,2007-04-04,4,"I heeded other reviewers' advice to brown the chicken first; this made for a more visually appealing end product.  Other reviewers commented it took about 20 minutes to glaze--they were absolutely right.  Thanks for a great recipe, and two helpful suggestions."
74281,68955,2007-04-09,5,"I forgot to brown the chicken before I added the sauce but this recipe still turned out beautifully! We are low(er) carbing so I used Splenda instead of sugar and was worried that it would take sugar to get the glaze effect. My worries were without merit because the sauce turned into a beautiful, delicious glaze and this meal was a BIG hit with my family! I may try browning the chicken next time to see if there is a difference, but this will be a regular on our menu for sure!!"
489552,68955,2007-07-24,5,"This recipe was sooooo easy and delicious!  JanRoundOz you were right to say to be patient and let the sauce boil to a thinckening point, it did :)  I doubled the recipe and glad I did.
Thank Tomoko for me for allowing you to post a fantastic dish :)"
461834,68955,2007-04-17,5,"This is very similar to an appetizer recipe that I recieved from a friend for Japanese Chicken drumettes.  I loved the flavor of the chicken, but I think next time I would brown the chicken first.  This is such a simple and tasty dinner, thank you for posting!!!"
377581,68955,2007-04-23,2,"Sorry, this just wasn't for us. It's easy to make, but the vinegar flavor is too overpowering."
248023,68955,2007-04-25,5,"Made this countless times now... I can't believe I forgot to review...but with over 300 ratings... you know it's gonna be GREAT! My mom used to make a variation of this when I was a little girl and I did do one thing differently.  Instead of putting all the ingredients in the pan at the beginning, I browned my chicken in a little oil first just to crisp up the skin.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients and followed the recipe from there.  The chicken almost falls off the bone...  Sometimes I double up on all the sauce ingredients (except the vinegar) so we can have plenty of sauce at the end to spoon over our rice.  So yummy and easy for a weekend night dinner but yet elegant enought to serve to guests!  Thanks!"
185926,68955,2007-04-29,5,This is something that we could put into our regular menu line up to be used on a regular basis.  It is simple and tastes great with steamed white rice.  In the future I will try to cook it on med-high sooner to reduce the sauce as the meat is cooking.  Perhaps reduce the simmer time to 10 minutes.  Thank you for the recipe.  My 5 yr old son and I enjoyed it.
251626,68955,2007-05-16,3,This was good and easy. Thanks
316717,68955,2007-06-20,5,"i used 4 bone in chicken thighs and found that it was enough for the sauce since most of it went away from me trying to get it to thicken up. i kept it simmering for an hour and 10 mins...not sure what i did wrong..maybe because i browned it first since oil came out of the chicken...maybe the oil kept it from thickening?  another small problem i had was the texture of the chicken. we're more into crispy skins. even browning it didn't help since the sauce turned it all mushy. but overall we still enjoyed this recipe. picky kids ate plenty and even asked for more. hubby told me he really enjoyed it also and told me to put it in his favorites file. this recipe sorta reminds me of a filipino dish called ""adobo"". almost has the same ingredients except instead of balsamic vinegar we use cane vinegar. very good recipe. thank you for sharing."
286851,68955,2007-06-24,4,"I made this recipe as directed, but I used lower-sodium soy sauce and a jalapeno, as that is what I had on hand. I was concerned that would make the dish ""hot"", but it was not hot at all and ended up being kid friendly. After bringing to boil and simmering the 20 minutes, it took approximately 12 minutes on highest heat (almost a hard boil) and the liquid miraculously reduced with no problem. Do be sure to turn the chicken often as directed, as I imagine it will burn quickly if not watched and turned. The sauce is both salty and sweet, and becomes very dark and sticky. Messy and finger-licking. This was easy to make. Served with asian veggies and white rice on the side. My family really enjoyed this, and we will be making it again."
88099,68955,2007-09-02,5,"I have to add my 5 star here.  This was delicious.  Except for using a jalepeno pepper in place of the hot chili pepper, I made this as written and we loved it.  Plenty of wonderful flavored sauce to cover the chicken and rice that I served it on.  I can see that adding some vegetables to this would also work great.  Thanks for sharing. I'll be making this again."
386849,68955,2007-09-10,5,Thank you for posting this excellent recipe.  The sauce did thicken but you have to be patient.  Will definitely make again.
371738,68955,2007-09-10,4,"Very easy recipe.  Quick & tasty, too.  My 3-year-old loved it.  The only change I did was Splenda packet instead of the regular sugar.  Sauce thickened nicely.  Thank you."
229850,68955,2007-09-16,5,"Just needed to say we LOVED this chicken. I am sooo grateful to finally find a good way to fix chicken legs. I am not a fan of them and this changed my mind. Although I can see many other cuts being great in this also, as other reviewers stated. I did as many others did and removed the chicken after it was cooked, as it does take quite a while for it to thicken. I almost gave it up. But thinking about some of the other reviews, I knew it would work if I just had patience,it paid off, served it over rice, and doubled the sauce and drizzled that over rice. So easy, great tasting, just need a little patience! Thanx for great addition to my files."
229524,68955,2007-09-30,4,The chicken turned out tender with a lot of flavor.  Just couldn't get the sauce to reduced sticky glaze;(  Will make again though.
377039,68955,2007-10-15,3,"This was pretty good. I made exactly as directed, except that I didn't have a chili pepper so I subbed some red chili flakes.  It wasn't spicy and the vinegar taste cooked off neatly.  The sauce thickened properly -- actually, I took my eyes off of it for a few moments too long and it thickened TOO much and began to burn.  It had a good flavor, though didn't really make us POP.  Not bad for an easy weeknight recipe."
4470,68955,2007-11-05,5,"What a wonderful sauce - loved the chicken!  I used skinless boneless thighs and I can only imagine how wonderful drumsticks with skin on would be.  The thighs came out moist and loaded with flavor.  Served over basmati rice, steamed fresh carrots & green beans.  Wonderful dinner thanks Jan"
355637,68955,2007-11-11,4,Yummy and so easy! Served w/ egg drop soup.
447123,68955,2007-11-26,5,"Dear me oh my!! This stuff was nothing short of FANTASTIC!!! I used boneless chicken breast and fried thoes quick in my fryer. Really this sauce was just too good!! Next time I will double on the sauce. Also I added an extra chilli because we like a lot of heat.
If you are looking at this and wondering what you should do........................try it!! You will not be disappointed. THANKS JanRoundOZ!!!"
189616,68955,2007-12-27,5,"This is one of those recipes that 5* does not do a recipe justice. 2 days later and my DH was still praising its glories! The funny thing is he had it as a leftover! My DH worked that night so I made this for myself and my boys, and removed the meat for him and served it atop recipe#99649 for him to bring to work the next day.
Thank You so very much!"
222433,68955,2007-12-27,5,5 more stars!
178742,68955,2007-12-30,5,"It's been 2 weeks now since I made the chicken.. Let's just say this rating is 2 weeks over due, because this recipe was spectacular!!! I followed directions to the tee, and it made enough sauce with even some to spare. Oh, I take that back about following the directions. I first browned my chicken legs in a little vegetable oil on all sides. After browned, I removed from the skillet, washed the skillet, and proceeded with the sauce. After all the ingredients for the sauce was in the skillet I then added the chicken to the sauce. This way there is none of that NASTY SCUM!
This was the first time ever that I bought dark meat. I don't know why I thought I didn't like dark meat, but lately I keep hearing it's so much more flavorful then white. Well let me tell you not only is it more flavorful, it's cheaper!! We absolutely loved Japanese Mum's Chicken, and are happy to be among the 100's who have tried it and loved it.

Thank you for sharing...
I love recipezaar, I really really do. I look forward each day to viewing recipes found on here!"
76951,68955,2008-01-02,5,Outstanding!  The whole family gave it a 5.  I doubled the sauce and used 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Reminded me alot of General Tso chicken but not as high in calories and much easier to prepare.  I will definitely be making this again!
666723,68955,2008-01-06,5,"This was good... I really liked the taste of the balsalmic vinegar in there.  I love garlic, so besides using the one whole clove, I also minced a clove and threw it in.  I served it over herb and chicken stock rice and DH said it was tasty.  My sauce wasn't thickening, so I added cornstarch and it started thickening once I turned it down quite a bit.  This was a yummy dinner, thank you :)"
353131,68955,2008-01-14,4,DH and I enjoyed this recipe! Very tasty!
251917,68955,2008-01-31,5,Delicious! Wouldn't change a thing!
240552,68955,2008-03-10,5,Delish!  I used thighs and it was great.  Thank you!
185285,68955,2008-03-19,5,"Great dish! I made sure to use a quality balsamic, which I think is crucial when it's such a prevelant taste here. I opted for skinless chicken breasts and made sure to only cook them until they were finished to avoid overdrying them.  This dish can lean towards Asian but also does well with traditional Italian fare. I opted for a Butternut Squash soup and Italian Chef Salad. Great meal!"
470351,68955,2008-05-23,4,"This chicken was super flavorful.  I used chicken breasts that I cut up into bite-sized chunks.  I brought sauce to a boil and then simmered my chicken for 15-20 minutes and removed while I continued to let the sauce thicken.  For some reason, my sauce never thickened.  I even added cornstarch to it but still it never thickened.  We honestly didn't care because the sauce still tasted great and it was amazing served over white rice.  I upped the garlic (family personal taste) and I kept everything else the same.  I will definitely make this again to try to get the whole ""sticky"" theme this recipe is supposed to deliver.  Great recipe!  EDIT:  I've made this twice since the first try and still haven't come close to getting this one to get ""sticky"" like it's supposed to.  I cooked it so long the last time that I ran 30 minutes past the dinner hour...still not sticky.  Tasty flavors but just takes too much time to accomplish...if you're ever able to."
497077,68955,2008-05-27,5,DELICIOUS! Only change I made was to use thighs instead of drumsticks. My whole family wanted the recipe that night! Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!!!
52262,68955,2008-09-18,5,"Very good chicken!  Made with drumsticks, thighs, and boneless chicken breasts.  Definitely better with the dark bone-in meat, but breasts were still good.  Had to please all my eaters!"
810787,68955,2011-08-12,3,I was disappointed in the flavor. It was just okay to me. I can't say I will make this again.
189475,68955,2009-01-24,3,"Sorry, but this just didn't work out well for me. I had high expectations and was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly but I wasn't impressed. I had invited my mom and her boyfriend over for dinner and they liked it but they didn't think it would be worth making again. There wasn't any specific problem with the recipe; it didn't taste bad, but it's just not something I would make ever again."
91392,68955,2009-01-04,5,"Good, easy, and you have everything you need in the house!"
37305,68955,2009-01-04,3,"I have wanted to try this forever and finally got a chance tonight.  I followed the recipe exact, ended up with a nice, dark glaze and all went as expected.  I just thought the end result wasn't worth the time and effort it took to make it (I stayed at my stove the whole time, worrying about the right amount of heat under the pan to end up with a nice glaze, completely cooked chicken and nothing burning).  This was nice for a change, just not what I expected.  Thanks!"
92816,68955,2009-02-07,3,This was ok.It was simple to make but not quite the taste I thought it would be. I found the balsamic vinegar overpowered the dish a little too much.
439797,68955,2009-02-17,5,"I doubled the sauce ingredients and used three big chicken breasts cut in chunks.  I cooked the chicken until it was done, and then took it out until the glaze formed, then put it back in.  This was terrific!"
1122161,68955,2009-03-17,5,"This turned out very good! I used cut up chicken breast strips. I cooked in the sauce until they were done, took them out, reduced the sauce, (it took about 15 min to reduce on medium-high). When the sauce was ready I put the chicken back in and poured everything on some rice. I also mixed some broccoli up in the leftover sauce in the pan. This was a great, tasty meal. Thanks for the recipe!"
400708,68955,2009-04-21,5,"With over 600 5 star reviews and 26 pictures; you sure don't need mine - but after making this I have to put in my two cents (or should I say stars) So easy and the taste is awesome, couldn't have a better combination.  I didn't change a thing, used chicken thighs (with skin as instructed) and it was great.  So differant from my normal chicken dinners and elegant too.  I could certainly use this even for those special company meals.  Thanks for posting and sharing this great recipe."
226863,68955,2009-05-02,5,"I used mainly boneless, skinless thighs, but through two drumsticks in with skin to help the flavor.  The sauce did take a while to cook down, but it is delicious.  I made this for All New Zaar Cookbook Tag game!  Thanks so much for posting a delicious recipe."
879716,68955,2009-06-10,5,Awesome .... sweet and savory.  Thanks for posting!!! :)
1072593,68955,2009-11-20,5,"A fine dining experience, but with me doing the dishes.  Made for Ed'n9 A/NZ Tag."
1506604,68955,2010-01-21,5,"I wasn't even going to bother but this recipe is so simple and tastes so GOOD! I was worried about using balsalmic vinegar in a asian recipe and the fact that there is no lid in the instructions but all u do is pour, stir, and flip... so simple, the only thing i would do is increase ""glaze"" ingredients and use a lid..."
969481,68955,2010-01-29,4,"I have made this twice now and the sauce did not reduce. Perhaps I need to let it cook longer, but going off the time posted (45 minutes) I'm guessing it needs to cook longer than that. My kids and spouse still loved the flavor of the chicken, but I still need to find the time it takes to reduce the sauce. Whoever took the photos, please tell me how long you cooked it! Thanks!"
1365025,68955,2010-08-28,4,"This was pretty good. I don't like real spicy chicken so instead of the hot chili pepper I used chili powder. It turn out pretty good. Your right when you said to have patience when cooking the sauce down to a glace, it takes awhile but darn well worth it."
1133190,68955,2011-08-09,5,"The flavor of this chicken can't be beat!  I used chicken thighs with skin on and the sauce was almost too greasy - I wonder if taking the skin off halfway through cooking would help?  I like the idea of doing this in a crockpot as another reviewer suggested and may try that next time.  We had a little extra glaze to use on the rice and broccoli I served with the chicken, perfect!  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!"
839492,68955,2011-10-29,5,"Very good, however, the glaze takes much longer than 20 minutes to thicken as directed. I just let it simmmer, simmer and simmer...it finally thickened up. I suspect that perhaps those that tasted too much vinegar did not let it cook off enough. <br/>I prepared my 4 chicken breasts halves(boneless, skinless) in the crock pot with the glaze and then poured it off into a small pot and simmered on the stove until it thickened. While the glaze was thickening, I ""shredded"" the chicken in large pieces.<br/>I also added some quartered onion and an additional clove of garlic which I made sure some of which simmered in the pot with the glaze.<br/>Served with steamed rice, carrots & broccoli. I think some water chestnuts would add a nice crunch, but I didn't have them on hand. Thanks for sharing!<br/>***Update*** With the remaining leftovers, and since we had a snowfall today (in October!) I felt compelled to have soup. My husband mentioned he thought the initial dish was a little salty (I even used low sodium soy sauce) So I took the cooked rice, chicken and some water to make a Chicken Rice Soup for lunch today. I topped it off with some bean sprouts....it was a hit!"
456858,68955,2012-12-19,3,"Well, I made this the first time and I wasn't impressed.  Then, since my hubby is the better cook in the house, I asked him to make it the second time around.  Again, not impressed.  Would not make again.  It's not bad, but I guess just disappointed compared to the many positive reviews."
2549237,68955,2013-01-14,4,No need for take-out with a Chinese/Japanese recipe this easy and this good.  My husband thinks it tastes just like the mushrooms & chicken he gets at our favorite Chinese restaurant.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks JustJanS.
207176,68955,2013-11-12,5,I loved how easy this was to make!  I used 2 tsp of jarred jalapeno peppers and garnished with toasted sesame seeds and chopped scallions. My kids want me to try it with boneless breasts next time. Thanks for posting this. I had wanted to try it for some time now!
1581225,68955,2015-01-28,4,"Enjoyed by the family, great tasting glaze, however a bit time consuming waiting for it to caremalise."
198154,68955,2015-03-08,4,"While I did not have any of this, I did make it for my family, who all rated it between 4 and 5 stars.  They really enjoyed it. My only complaint is the messy clean up.  Next time I may try the crock pot method that another reviewer posted and see if my family likes it that way as well."
74652,105726,2005-01-25,5,I seved with Spaghetti and Meatsauce and let me tell you this bread is fantastic!  I used Italian bread.  Thanks Kitten!
52543,105726,2005-10-11,5,Yummy!! I served it with your Broccoli & Pasta Bake (#69217) but it would make a perfect side to almost any meal. Thanx Carol!
4470,105726,2006-02-03,5,"   I had made Chili and wanted a garlic/Parmesan roll to go with it so I hi-jacked your recipe and adapted it to suit one crisp Swiss roll - Easy, perfect- thanks Kittencal I do enjoy your recipes"
88099,105726,2006-02-04,5,Is there any flavored bread recipe that I don't love.  This was just awesome Kitz.  I think I used 4 cloves of garlic minced and used PaulaG's Sourdough Dinner Rolls that I made last night for JQ's French Dip.  Great stuff.  Would not change a thing.  Life is Good.
222564,105726,2006-03-04,4,"This was good, crispy outside and soft inside garlic bread. I also halved the butter mixture for a frech bread, but used all 2tbs of garlic. Wow!"
37449,105726,2006-04-05,5,Yummy scrummy! My DH asked for more! Easy great way to fix toast! I used 9 grain Italian bread. Thanks Kitten!
68960,105726,2006-05-04,5,Kittencal what wonderful garlic bread.  I made up exactly as directed.  Love the butter smeared over the top before warming. Served with Uncle Bill's Green Split Pea with Hambone Soup Recipe #79563 for a delicious meal that the whole family enjoyed. I'll definitely be making these to store in the freezer.  I would like to try some with the addition of some chilli flakes but saying that your recipe is perfect as is. Thanks for sharing.
50969,105726,2006-05-08,5,"i made this to go with beefy velveeta salsa mac recipe#126236.i don't like minced garlic so i used 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder instead,from the there i fixed the rest of the recipe as written.sine i only needed 6 slices of the toast, i flash froze the other 2 slices,and baked the rest.had to turn the broiler on to get it to brown the way i liked it.it was really good thank you for posting."
229850,105726,2006-06-17,5,This was very easy and tasted great! thanks!
103876,105726,2006-07-01,5,Perfect!  This combination has just the right flavor.  I will use this recipe from now on when making garlic bread.  Thanks for posting!
32058,105726,2006-09-24,5,Would not change a thing.  Perfect as written!
36944,105726,2006-11-26,5,This was simple to make and uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I  used sesame bread rather than Texas Toast.  The flavor was great and I will be making this again.  Thanks for the delicious recipe KITTENCAL!
394077,105726,2007-03-31,5,"Kittencal, My goodness.  Your garlic bread is sooooo delish.  My daughter exclaimed, ""this is the best garlic bread I have ever tasted and I have tasted many.I can eat the whole loaf!!"" I agree, these are good and so easy.  Thank you for posting your recipe."
231054,105726,2007-05-20,5,I'm not sure how this slipped by without my rating before this!!!  I've made this several times and it's always gone in a flash!  Even those who say they don't care for much of a garlic taste stuff it in their mouths without saying a word (then grab up another piece)!!!  I think the mayonnaise really is the key ingredient which sets this apart from other garlic bread recipes -- and the oregano is a really nice addition as well.  WE LOVE THIS!
461834,105726,2007-05-29,5,"I made this as directed, but cut the recipe in half, as there was only the three of us.  I used a mini Italian loaf of bread and have enough garlic mixture left over to use for another night.  This was very tasty."
248023,105726,2007-10-15,4,"My BF has just recently come to find out that he LOVES garlic bread with mayo in the spread.  So, I have been making different recipes trying to figure out which ones he likes the most... I used the fresh garlic and parsley...FRESH is better, I agree.  I liked this bread because it browned up nicely on the edges with out the bread becoming overly crunchy.  This bread also uses only parmesan cheese and not any cheddar or other cheeses...which made for a ""lighter"" topping.  LOVED the fresh parsley in the spread... just yummy! I did end up baking it for 15-17 minutes to achieve the nice browning around the edges.  My BF would have preferred more cheese, but I thought it was great without it... Thanks for another great garlic bread Kitten!!!"
158086,105726,2007-10-22,5,great easy recipe...I had some small baquette rolls and this recipe worked our great...thanks
262312,105726,2007-11-04,5,loved it!!  only way i'll be doing garlic bread from now on!!!  i added an additional garlic clove and 1 teaspoon crushed pepper flakes. delish!!!  i will be adding this to my keeper cookbook!!  thanks for another great recipe!!!
353131,105726,2007-12-22,3,"I am so sorry, I really was looking forward to this bread as all of your recipes are great. I thought it could've used less butter and the mayo taste was a little different. Also I thought it had a little too much of a salty taste and I normally love salty foods. DH thought it was too salty and too greasy. Maybe it was the size bread I used. Did you use fresh parmesean or the kind from a jar? I used the 100% real stuff from a jar. Also, I used powdered garlic. Don't think I will try it again. I hate to use so much butter and waste it.  Again, I am so sorry."
140132,105726,2007-12-30,5,Absolutely delicious.  I made this to go along with our steak dinner....very good.  As always Kittencal you have come through with an amazing recipe that is perfect with our meal.....thank you so much....Stephanie
173579,105726,2008-03-02,5,This is a very nice garlic bread.  Thanks for posting.
55729,105726,2008-03-20,5,"I really thought this tasted awesome, and I guess everyone else did also, because the 4 of us ate a whole loaf. I used the larger amounts of all ingredients, and also used the mayonnaise. The only change I would make next time would be to use a sturdier, homemade style loaf, or even a whole wheat Italian bread. I bought the squishier style from the store, and it was a bit messy to serve and eat. I am already craving more of this delicious bread!"
226863,105726,2008-10-19,4,"I was disappointed in this bread, and my son thought it was ""gross"". And he loves garlic bread! I prepared it exactly as written, but the butter/mayo mixture just stayed on top of the bread...it didn't soak into the bread (maybe because of the mayo?) I uncovered the bread for the last five minutes to try and force it to melt into the bread, but it still just ""sat on top"" of the bread. I may try this under the broiler, since I have lots of leftovers to use. Sorry, Kittencal....I usually love your recipes, and had this in my ""Want to Try"" Cookbook...made it for cookbook tag, but this isn't one I'll make again.  SECOND DAY:) To get rid of the leftovers, we put a couple of slices under the broiler...what a change!  Maybe letting the bread sit overnight allowed it to absorb the mayo-mix, or maybe it was just the broiling, but the bread was good that way."
55578,105726,2008-10-28,1,"Gosh I hate to be the lone man out, but dh and I did not like this at all.  I'm sorry to rate it this low.  We felt like it tasted mushy and heavy.  DH said he likes his bread garlicky and light.  Sorry!"
774665,105726,2008-11-29,5,Very good! Thanks again for another great recipe!
8688,105726,2008-12-04,5,"This is the way I have been making my Garlic bread for years!  Although, I do not wrap in foil.  I slice the loaf length-wise, allow to heat in the oven for 15 minutes, allowing buttered side and crust to toast.  Then when removed from the oven, I slice into serving sized pieces and serve in a towel lined bread basket. Thanks for posing, Kittencal!"
937635,105726,2009-07-14,5,"Kittencal, this is The Best garlic bread I've ever had! I like the PP's comment about everyone thinking they're a good cook because of You - I feel the same way! I couldn't find any non-skinny and long French bread, so I got a loaf of foccacia bread from a local bakery and sliced it length-wise like a PP suggested, baking at 350 for 10 minutes and then on low broil for 1.5 minutes. I also used 3 larger cloves and one small clove of garlic. Magnificent! And I loved the color that the parsley added!"
333017,105726,2009-10-22,5,Excellent!!
191533,105726,2009-11-23,4,"Good, not great. I did use unsalted butter, and in my opinion it would have been better with more salt. I also added approx. 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, and was glad I did. This is a good mixture of ingredients; I just play around with the ratios! Thanks for sharing!"
195589,105726,2010-04-07,5,"Excellent! I made this tonite and it was a big hit. I used some mayo as well as the butter and had to use sourdough French Rolls as that is all we had. And they were very delish! Thanks for posting, KittenCal!"
198154,105726,2010-05-30,4,"We made this using the garlic toast option. We sprinkled shredded Cheddar on top of half of it. It was enjoyed by everyone. We liked the Cheddar topped pieces the best. The only thing I did differently was to finish cooking it under the broiler. The rest of our meal was already on the table and I needed it to cook a little quicker. It turned out great. Thanks!
Update: We had grilled Corn on the Cob tonight and used the extra garlic butter mixture on it.
It was good this way as well.  Thanks Kittencal!"
362983,105726,2012-07-24,5,"Kittencal, your recipes never disappoint! This garlic bread was soo delicious! I halved the recipe for a small batch of garlic bread and still have some extra garlic butter for tomorrow, though man, I'm craving more already. Thank you for a great recipe, and for the epic and delicious garlic breath :)"
33159,105726,2013-02-03,5,Tasty!  The method sounds daunting but it really is easy to do.  Nice presentation!
653438,105726,2013-05-20,5,This is another hit by Kittencal!  So easy and so delicious.  I used fresh parsley and probably a little more parmesan.  Served on rolls one night with recipe#99870#99870 and another night on some sourdough bread.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup ~ Jan-June 2013 tag game.
620763,105726,2013-11-17,5,Made mine as garlic toast using a loaf of Italian bread from the bakery.  Garlic butter spread is delicious!
218535,105726,2015-01-19,5,Very good. We reduced the amount of parmesan for our taste.
540346,105726,2015-10-13,5,"Made this as directed, except used 1 tsp garlic powder in place of fresh garlic.  Delicious!  I put mine on an Italian loaf and served with Lasagna Soup.  Yum!"
1179225,105726,2017-03-02,5,Oooooh yeah! Yum! Thanks for the keeper recipe!
28603,15521,2002-04-25,3,"I usually love broccoli, but didn't love this.  It was edible though and easy to make.  If I made it again I would omit the garlic and add ham or chicken."
104295,15521,2007-07-10,0,"I obviously mis-read this recipe because I thought I had followed the directions but did not.  I made a sandwhich using a slice of cheese and some chopped broccoli and really enjoyed it.  But when I came back to review (I tagged it for healthy ABC) realized I had forgotten the shredded cheese, plus the other stuff!  So I'm just commenting that I really enjoyed the concept and will make again.  Thanks."
54678,13546,2003-09-15,5,"I have made this dough recipe for years - quick - no waiting to rise. My recipe says warm water 105 to 115 degrees and the oil was vegetable. Makes enough for 2-11"" or 1 deep dish 13x9x2"" pizzas. Thanks for posting - now its in my zaar cookbook."
227607,13546,2008-05-06,5,"This was very easy and good.  I added garlic, basil, and oregano to the dough.  Once the pizza was done I brushed melted butter and garlic on the crust.  It was SOOOO good."
42720,13546,2004-09-11,5,"This recipe worked perfectly. I am thinking that maybe the reviewer who rated this recipe one star could have measured the water incorrectly because this dough does not come out like paste. It is a bit sticky(as most doughs are), but I kneaded it on a floured surface for just a few minutes and let it rest for 10 minutes afterwards. It worked very well on my 16-inch baking stone. I used recipe # 90229 for my topping. The crust rose slightly and browned very nicely. It tasted much better than any I have had from a pizza shop. This one is definitely a keeper for me.
(This is a revised review to correct the recipe # for the topping I used)
"
60989,13546,2004-10-03,5,This was quick and easy PLUS tasted great. It was easier to make this than mix up a box of pizza dough. Thanks so much! We will be using this often.
91392,13546,2007-01-12,4,"Made a very quick, rather thick but nice pizza crust. I would make it again if I were short on time."
187373,13546,2007-04-19,5,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet!  I've made it so many times!  I used to always buy package crust, but not anymore thanks to this recipe.  It's so easy to make and quick, too! I usually add italian seasoning, garlic powder and whatever other seasoning I feel like! Great recipe!"
55578,13546,2007-05-06,5,"Hi Beth!  What a great, quick recipe.  The dough was of perfect consistancy.  Easy to roll.  I doubled the recipe and it went together very quickly.  I let it set maybe 20 mins while I got the other ingredients together.  The double recipe made 2 really big (bigger than my stone :)) pizzas.  I am so glad I tried this as I doubt I'll do Dominos anytime soon, that's the only place the delivers here and I hate their pizza.  So a big thank you for the recipe."
371738,13546,2007-10-23,5,"My first pizza crust from scratch was a success because of this recipe.  (Although I have made it 3 times already, I am just rating it now).  Such a quick recipe and easy to do.  We like thin crust pizza, so I can actually get two whole pizzas out of this --- one for the kids and one for the adults.  Thanks for a great recipe that is going into my permanent file!"
353131,13546,2007-12-07,2,"I am so sorry. We did not like this crust. DH thought plain old biscuit dough would have been just as good as this. Maybe I did something wrong. I didnot use olive oil so maybe that was the mistake. Maybe we are just used to crusts that raise for a while. I normally do ABM crust recipe.
Again, Sorry to rate this so low!!!"
264017,13546,2008-01-09,4,"This was definitely an easy recipe, even for someone like me who is yeast-impaired. I made a double batch for two different pizzas. One I baked on a pizza stone and the other on a no-stick metal pan. Both crusts turned out relatively the same. The flavor seemed just a bit bland and didn't have that ""ooh, the crust is really good"" quality I was hoping for. Next time, I will add some Italian seasonings to the dough as suggested in step #8."
50969,13546,2008-02-06,0,"I made this as part of our dinner on 2/3/08.And I don't know what might went wrong but,it turned out very thick.I don't know what I could have done wrong.But with all the good reviews I'm going to try this again at a later date and then review it.Shapeweaver :)"
176615,13546,2008-04-13,5,"Great crust! Doubled the recipe and made one cheese pizza plus recipe #93384. Good basic pizza dough, easy to make and work with. I was busy in the kitchen and did end up letting the dough rise about 30 minutes before pressing into the pan. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
242484,13546,2008-09-18,5,You really made an Italian girl really happy tonight.  I've been looking for an easy pizza crust for years that is as good as delivery and this is it!  Thanks a bunch for sharing!  You're going to save me a ton of money for years to come.
439797,13546,2009-03-19,5,"Great recipe.  I needed a quick recipe to make a requested recipe of ""baked potato Pizza"" and this was perfect."
359220,13546,2009-03-21,3,"This sure is a quick little recipe for a busy night!  By the time DH had driven three blocks away to the grocery store, I had an entire pizza in the oven!  I had to add about 5 minutes to the cooking time, which still didn't help the middle cook through.  Also, the toppings were pretty browned and crispy.  A little too bland for us, but I'll still keep the recipe on hand for those nights when I REALLY need a quick meal.  Thanks for posting!"
140132,13546,2009-06-10,4,"What an easy crust!  I made this for dinner tonight and it worked wonderfully.  I too was skeptical about not letting the dough rise, but it didn't need to.  I used it to make a jellyroll pan size pizza.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and baked the crust for a few minutes before adding toppings.  I am so glad I found this crust recipe, I will use again.....and again.....and again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us."
126440,13546,2009-09-09,5,Quick easy crust for a pizza.  I pre-baked for 10 min and then put toppings on and baked until cheese was melted. Next time I will try some herbs in the dough.
839492,13546,2009-09-21,5,"Made this with the Great Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I subbed 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for the regular flour. Also put some cornmeal on the pizza stone before laying the crust on the stone. Didn't change the flavor, but gave it that nice texture. Quickest scratch pizza dough I've made to date. Thanks for the post!"
1072593,13546,2011-01-03,5,"Family lore tells that my first sentence was I demanding my slice of pizza pie.  Becoming creative, I used this with recipe #223590.  Made for Soups and Breads Recipe Tag."
1179225,13546,2011-01-22,5,Excellent!!!
203111,13546,2011-11-29,5,"I'm so happy to have discovered and tried this recipe because not only is it tasty, it's also quick and easy to make.  The only thing I wasn't wild about was that the bottom of the crust was a bit soggy after baking it at 450 for 15 minutes so next time I will bake it for about 5 min. before adding the toppings.  Thanks!"
142367,13546,2012-03-24,5,This was so easy that I was worried it wouldn't turn out! The crust had good flavor and the pizza disappeared. I added some granulated garlic to the dough -- yum!  I did find the dough pretty sticky and had to flour my board quite a bit. Thanks for sharing this keeper!
928301,13546,2012-07-09,0,"Didn't like it this time, but I made some modifications so I can't blame the recipe.  Next time I'll try trading out the half cup of flour for some corn meal then coating the pan with olive oil so the crust will absorb the flavor.  I'll drop the sugar--didn't like that sweet taste, and put more garlic/onion/italian flavoring."
294000,13546,2013-01-25,5,"Wow. I am shocked how easy and fast this was. And good! It was my daughter's 100th day of school today so we shaped the dough into three pieces to look like ""100."" Added Italian seasoning, too. Both kids helped me spread the sauce and cheese. She thought it was great. I think we'll have pizza night every week and use this dough. DH was impressed, too. Thanks!"
199020,13546,2013-07-16,5,"Great tasting crust! Not my favorite because I prefer a thinner, crispier crust, but this was very good. It would make great breadsticks. Thanks!"
132383,13546,2013-09-10,5,"Easy Peasy...I loved how this came together so quick and easy.  My husband said &quot;now we can have pizza anytime we want!&quot;  I used the sugar and the italian seasoning in the dough.  I did want a thin crust so I used part for the pizza and made breadsticks with the other (my one year loved those).  Thank you so much!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update 9/10/2013 - I hadn&#039;t used this recipe in a long time.  My daughter was diagnosed with a soy and egg allergy and when they said they were having special pizza day at school, I just cringed at the thought of telling my daughter something else she couldn&#039;t have.  Well, when my husband suggested I make her a &quot;special&quot; pizza, I knew exactly which recipe I was going to use.  I made the dough and divided them into four pieces.  I rolled each out into a 7-inch pizza.  I made the one pizza for my daughter&#039;s school and pre-baked and flash froze the other three.  I can&#039;t say how the frozen ones will turn out, but we sure do (still) love this recipe!"
350750,13546,2014-03-02,5,Great crust!  This was super easy to make and tasted great.  Thinking about making calzones with it.  Thank You!
36944,42094,2003-02-24,5,"Great enchilada sauce, Mark!  It's easy, quick, uses ingredients right out of my pantry and best of all it tastes wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!"
173579,42094,2007-04-21,5,This was outstanding!  What more can I say.  Will be using this from now on.  Thanks for posting.
52543,42094,2003-12-19,5,"Absolutely delicious! I encountered no probems scaling the recipe to 1 cup, used fresh garlic and the only chili powder they sell in our stores - but it was red. This was the perfect sauce for Laudee's Anasazi Enchiladas (recipe #39681). Thanx Mark! "
22015,42094,2004-02-21,5,Very good - we took your advice since we love spice and doubled all the spices.  Much better than that canned stuff.
103876,42094,2004-03-01,5,Everyone is right on target with the ratings for this tasty sauce.  This is a great recipe.  I was delighted with the taste and convenience of making this from scratch.  I made a double recipe and froze 2/3 of it for future meals.  Thanks for posting!
37036,42094,2004-04-13,5,"The perfect enchilada sauce!!!  I normally buy the canned Old El Paso Enchilada Sauce, but not anymore!  This was so easy to make and had a wonderful flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  This recipe will be used often in my house!  Thanks Mark!     "
26512,42094,2004-05-05,5,"Oh, my goodness!!!! Why haven't I ever made enchilada sauce from scratch before? Well, I will from now on. This was a real winner, Mark. I used 2 tsp of minced garlic and added a little bit more of everything else. I also used chicken stock. I served this over ground beef enchiladas with black olives, cheese & green onions and then topped with a bit more cheese. We topped them with sour cream and salsa verde, served spanish rice on the side and drank ice cold Modelo Negro. Our Cinco De Mayo dinner was a huge success. Thanks for sharing another great recipe!!"
60992,42094,2004-07-01,5,"Thanks to this fantastically flavored and easy enchilada sauce, I have just made the best enchiladas EVER! It takes all of 5 minutes to get blended and you simmer as long as you like! Seriously...this is a MUST TRY RECIPE!!! The flavor difference is amazing from mixes or canned. The directions are easy to follow and the ingredients are not exotic...so whatcha waiting for? I took WAY too long to make this. Don't make the same mistake."
37636,42094,2004-09-09,5,"Excellent, very easy to make  enchilada sauce. I simmered mine over low heat for a very long time, until it was actually thicker than I wanted, but I wanted to give time to allow the flavors to blend. I then added water until the sauce totalled 3 cups and it was quite nice. I served this over chicken enchiladas. I will use this recipe often! Thanks for posting."
68884,42094,2004-09-15,5,"This is easy to make, but tastes absolutely great. I also simmered mine for a long while -- probably an hour & a half -- while cooking other things, & added more water (about another 3/4 cup). I also added cayenne pepper b/c we like things hot & additional garlic. This made plenty for my 9x13 pan of beef & been enchiladas. I won't use canned sauce again. Thanks!"
59780,42094,2004-10-19,5,This was easy to make and much cheaper than the store bought sauce! I used this recipe for the Enchilada sauce in Chili Lasagne recipe#85366. Thanks for posting!
101823,42094,2005-03-18,5,"I have prepared this sauce several times.  The first was as written, the second was with beef stock subbed for the water, and the third was with the additional liquid from recipe #59224 Chipotle Roast subbed for the water.  All were great, but the third method was outstanding.  This is such a simple method that produces an excellent enchilada sauce.  We love it.  Thanks."
176615,42094,2005-04-24,5,"Wonderful! Make this once, and you'll never buy the swill in a can again. Very quick, made from ingredients on hand and no MSG. I made as directed, letting simmer until fairly thick. Made for some killer enchiladas. Thanks, Mark, for a great recipe!"
160974,42094,2005-10-19,5,"This came in handy this morning, since I wanted a sauce to top my Double Corn Tortilla recipe. I didn't have regular chile powder, so I used 1 tsp. adobe powder and 3 tsps. taco seasoning (didn't want it too spicy).

Roxygirl"
37449,42094,2006-02-26,5,"I used this recipe for jumping point. I started with salsa, because that's what I had. I then added all the seasonings and water. It cooked to a nice consistency and was great for a quick sauce. Thanks so much!"
49304,42094,2006-03-21,5,"GREAT recipe for enchilida sauce. I made the sauce as stated, so easy to make and very tasty. I will never buy canned enchilida sauce again. Mark, thank you for posting the recipe."
125640,42094,2007-02-01,3,"I used this for wet burritos. It was really easy to make and the flavor is very different from canned. I used only 4 tsp of chipotle chili powder and I subbed tomato sauce (what I had in the pantry) so I only used 1 1/4 cups water. It tasted like it was missing something, so I threw in a beef bouillon cube and that improved it. I this would be better made with broth rather than water. DH wasn't terribly fond of this, but DS and I thought it was tasty. Thanks."
252816,42094,2007-04-27,5,"Made this sauce to go with #39681 Anasazi(chicken) enchildas..This sauce had  more chile powder flavor than my other sauce, I normally make but, was very good with these chicken enchildas..I will make this again..Both recipes were excellent..Thank U...."
58836,42094,2007-05-18,5,Made tonight to use with cheese enchiladas.  This is a very tasty sauce.  Our preference is green sauce but I do like red every once in a while.  I'm sure I will make this again.  Thanks!
91392,42094,2007-07-01,5,"Cheap, quick and easy to make.  I would never buy enchilada sauce after seeing how easy this is to make.  I prefer this recipe to ones that use tomato sauce and not tomato paste. I thickened it at the end with special flour thickener we use in France instead of making the roux, but that is just a note to myself for next time.  Nice recipe."
285039,42094,2007-08-23,5,"Terrific and easy sauce!  I will never buy canned enchilada sauce again!  I made ground beef and cheese enchiladas and the sauce made them nearly perfect!  Next time I will add onion sauteed in butter along with the beef, but this sauce would work well on chicken, beef, cheese, or cheese and onion enchilada.  A must have for Mexican food lovers!"
485151,42094,2007-10-18,4,"This was so simply & easy to make! I don't know how it differs from store bought enchilada sauce, but we loved it with our Shredded Beef Enchilada Casserole. This will be put in my recipe box to be used again."
74281,42094,2007-12-17,5,"I KNEW this had 101 great reviews for a reason, and I was sure right. I made this exactly as listed and it is so easy to make and REALLY delicious. I think the only thing I would do differently next time is to double the recipe and freeze a batch for quick after work use. Thanks for the GREAT recipe Mark!!"
59163,42094,2008-01-13,5,"This was awesome, no more buying the canned sauce anymore. It was so easy and with ingredients I always have on hand. I'm going to make a larger batch and keep it in the freezer. Thanks!"
355637,42094,2008-03-13,4,This was pretty good! Super easy too. Used it as a dip for chips too.
520150,42094,2008-07-09,5,I added just a little bit of chipotle in adobo.  Both dh & I enjoyed this very much.  I will be making it again.  Thank you very much for sharing!
93006,42094,2008-09-08,0,"Thank goodness - I will never have to use that yucky canned stuff again!  Love, love this sauce - gives a wonderful flavor to anything you use it on - and so easy!"
126440,42094,2008-12-28,5,I made this to use in Recipe #33665.  It is very good and freezes well.  Good to have on hand for use in other recipes too.
280166,42094,2009-01-26,4,This was a very good sauce and I liked that I could control the heat/spiciness.  My kids don't like much spice so I only used 2-3 tsp chili powder.  Thanks for posting!
222970,42094,2009-05-20,5,"Everything an enchilada sauce should be. Since cumin and garlic powder and salt are constituent parts of chili powder, I skipped them and upped the chili powder a little bit. (We don't mind heat!)"
879716,42094,2009-12-12,5,This was really good but it took me a minute to figure out I needed to add salt to really enhance the flavors. I also added a small piece of dark chocolate to add a little more depth of flavor and cut the acid of the tomato a bit. Easy and yummy. Next time I'll double or triple the recipe so I can store some in the freezer for a quick meal. Thanks for the recipe :)  UPDATE:  I made this again tonight and used only 2 cups water and added 1/2 tsp cocoa powder.  Perfect!
140806,42094,2010-02-03,5,I halved this recipe to pour over cheese and bean enchiladas that I made for OAMC. It is a silky and rich sauce. Smells great and easy to make. A perfect way to use up remaining tomato paste leftover from another recipe!
298447,42094,2010-03-23,5,Tastes great and so easy to make...with ingredients you probably already have in your pantry. Great reasons to never bother buying the canned stuff again! (I made this for Recipe #33665.) Thank you!
637486,42094,2010-06-23,5,"This was very good and super easy to make.  I'm not a fan of the canned enchilada sauce, so I'm happy to have found a replacement."
1506604,42094,2010-07-21,4,"I liked it, I felt like a real Mamita standing over my stove. It came out well and it was easy but it did not have nearly enough kick for me. I had to add ALOT of salt and pepper. I also added crushed pepper. I'll probably increase the chili powder next time."
140132,42094,2011-06-25,5,What a great sauce this is.  I needed some for a last minute meal decision and didn't have a can so I chose your recipe and am so glad I did. It had great flavor and thickened up nicely unlike some other sauces I have tried to make and failed miserably at....lol.  DH said we should can this so we always have around.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us.
394077,42094,2011-11-11,5,Excellent recipe Mark. I used olive oil instead of butter but the rest of the recipe remains as stated.. Thank you...
937635,42094,2012-01-26,5,"Great recipe! When I tasted it in the pan, I didn't like it much and would have given it 4 stars, but on the enchiladas it was perfect! I did add another tsp of chili powder and a half tsp of sugar. I think it would be even better with chicken stock instead of water, so I'll try that next time. Thanks for my new go-to recipe!"
203111,42094,2013-07-24,5,"Found a recipe I wanted to try,  recipe #17586, that called for enchilada sauce so I decided to try this.  So glad I did.  I really enjoyed it on my enchiladas and will use it whenever  I  make them from now on.  This sauce was so easy to put together and didn&#039;t take much time at all.  The only thing I changed was to cut the recipe in half for a half recipe of enchiladas."
839492,42094,2016-06-29,5,"Really good. I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce (no salt added) and water to equal the remainder of the liquid called for in the recipe (I didn't have 6 oz of tomato paste on hand). I also stirred a little beef base in to the finished sauce. This was really quick to put together and tasted so good. I used cooked ground beef (with a small amount of sauce &amp; shredded sharp cheddar stirred into it and topped it with the remaining sauce &amp; cheese. Served with corn, this time. Wish I had a little sour cream for garnish (with cilantro, lime some black beans and maybe a margarita...;) Anyway, really great recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
172369,102617,2005-01-24,5,"kittencal, Thank you for a great recipe, It is hard to find a truly great coleslaw, this is it.  I ate the whole bowl and It just kept tasting better everyday.  "
52543,102617,2005-03-06,5,"My husband says this is just like ""dear old mom used to make"" so my quest for the perfect creamy cole slaw is over! I used minced garlic & doubled the green onions - otherwise, no changes. Thanx for another winner Kitten!"
37449,102617,2005-04-19,5,"Yum! Very good recipe. I didn't have buttermilk, so used a tbls. of vinegar in whole milk. Worked like a charm! Thanks for a delicious cole slaw!"
149363,102617,2005-07-26,5,"O.K., this is just the BEST coleslaw we have ever tried.
Creamy, not too sweet not too tart...just delicous!
This will be my keeper recipe from now on...no need to try any others folks.
Thanks for a well written and easy to follow recipe Kitten!"
185446,102617,2005-11-19,5,"Another tasty recipe from Kittencal--coleslaw  is one of my favorites, and this hits the spot.  I think I'd like to live at Kittencal's house--her posted recipes all sound good. "
88099,102617,2005-11-22,5,"Kitten this was one of the best coleslaw recipes I have ever made.  I used a bag of cabbage and carrots already prepared which cut down on time, but otherise made as directed.  There was a lot of the dressing, but used a slotted spoon to serve.  Great combination of flavors.  You do need to let it sit for the amount of time stated.  I really didn't think I was going to like this when I first made it.  But as the flavors blend, it become outstanding.  Thanks so much."
135887,102617,2006-06-24,5,Excellent!  I reduced celery seeds and sugar but otherwise kept everything the same.  Very good slaw - served with pulled pork and pasta salad.
38643,102617,2006-07-04,5,I will not be looking for a cole slaw recipe anymore. This is perfect. Thank you!
222055,102617,2006-07-08,5,"Absolutely Delicious Slaw!!! I had a wonderful dinner last night which was made up of your recipes! I served this slaw along side your Buttermilk Fried Boneless Chicken Breast and your Oven-Baked Potato Cheddar Croquettes. Everyone raved!!! I called it a ""KITTENCAL Night!!! Thank you for your wonderful recipes!!!"
231054,102617,2006-07-26,5,"This hasn't even set in the refrigerator yet -- but it's so good already!!!  Can't wait to have it for dinner tonight.  I wanted to drink the dressing with a straw.  Finally, a cole slaw recipe that I know I can count on.  Thanks, Kitten for posting this -- the name on the recipe is very appropriate ""FAMOUS""!!!"
58836,102617,2006-12-25,5,"Made this today for christmas dinner.  It was very good.  My sis makes a wonderful coleslaw but I think this one is just as good.  I'm sure I'll make again.  Didn't have green onion, just used a small amount of white and didn't have lemon, used also a small amount of lime juice.  Very yummy.  Thanks Kitten!"
98919,102617,2007-02-14,5,"Kittencal is the chef of the week at our house since this is the 3rd recipe of hers I've used this week.  This coleslaw lived up to her high standards!!!  The only reason I say it was near perfect (not the recipe but by my own doing), is because I used sour milk in place of the buttermilk and 2% milk in place of the half and half. (I had used up all the half and half in her Spinach Parmesan Rice bake earlier this week).  My taste buds can only imagine how wonderful this recipe would be done the right way! I halved this and wished I hadn't after my 1 & 1/2 year old granddaughter and I sat in the kitchen and ""taste tested""...almost too late I realized that this dish might not make it to supper.  Thanks for sharing Kittencal..you are a super cook!"
229524,102617,2007-06-03,5,I bought a bag of coleslaw and added the elery seeds and made your dressing.  Was only able to chill it for 2 hours but it was delicious and so creamy.  We couldn't quit ohhhhing and ahhhing over the wonderful taste.
158086,102617,2007-09-24,5,"I was told to give this coleslaw 10 stars...I did not taste it as it went to the ""guys weekend together at the cottage""...but they raved about it, so it must have been great..."
140132,102617,2007-12-30,5,"perfection....as always, enjoyed this very much....thank you....Stephanie"
312577,102617,2008-03-14,5,I made this salad to go along with barbeque chicken sandwhiches which I served on Kittencal's soft burger buns.  This coleslaw is delightful!  I used two bags of preshreded coleslaw and added the carrots.  I used the fresh lemon juice too. Perfection!
470351,102617,2008-06-09,5,"Another home run for Kittencal!  This was excellent!  I'm not even much of a coleslaw fan but we were having guests over for a BBQ and I was already making a pasta salad but figured I should make another salad and opted for this one.  PERFECT!  I used pre-shredded cabbage and pre-shredded carrots.  I didn't put them in the food processor because I prefer larger pieces of carrot and cabbage in my coleslaw.  The only changes I made were to use low fat mayo and to cut the sugar a bit.  It was excellent from the second I mixed it together.  I let it chill for only about 5-6 hours and it was devoured.  Thank you for another perfect recipe.  This will be my only coleslaw recipe from now on.  UPDATE:  It's been 3 days since I made this coleslaw.  Tasted it today and tastes as good, if not better, than the day I made it.  It holds up well in the event you actually have leftovers."
394077,102617,2008-10-11,5,"Kitten, I normally don't like coleslaw but I love your coleslaw.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks again."
126440,102617,2009-01-19,5,"Delicious coleslaw.  I made half a recipe and made the sauce in the morning to refrig. then just before eating added the coleslaw mix, celery seed, and gr. onion.  Great served with Recipe #47391."
937635,102617,2009-06-15,5,"Awesome! Thank you :) First time I made coleslaw and it was perfect - DH Loved it and is a ""connoisseur"". I used my food processor and it chopped the cabbage into little bits, next time I think I'll try shredding the cabbage by hand because I like the longer confetti strands and don't quite know how to do it with my machine."
174991,102617,2009-07-04,5,I used the dressing on a package of coleslaw.  Very easy to put together and it makes a great dressing for the coleslaw.  I let it sit overnight in the  refrigerator so the flavors could blend.  Thanks for sharing.
318235,102617,2010-03-14,4,"This was quite good, just the right amount of sweetness. I served it with crab cakes and deviled eggs. Thank you!"
653438,102617,2010-03-17,5,WONDERFUL!!  I made this the other day to go with Recipe#18172#18172 for lunch (it hadn't chilled in the fridge for very long but oh it was good.  The next day we had it to go with Recipe#183526#183526 and ohhhhhh....so much tastier!! I made half a recipe and it made plenty.  I also used light cream in the sauce which made it nice and creamy.  This is a keeper and I'll go to this often.  Thank you again.
637486,102617,2010-07-07,5,"As usual, I'm not surprised that this was so good!  It had a great balance of tang and sweetness, with neither being to powerful.  I will be making this again."
333017,102617,2010-08-13,5,"Wonderful recipe!  I threw together a bag of pre-made cabbage and broccoli slaw...did 1-1/2 times the amount for the dressing.  I would make this one again!!!  Thanks for the posting, Kitten!!"
768828,102617,2010-12-25,5,Wonderful coleslaw.  I had to use bottled lemon juice (would have been better with fresh) and used homemade mayonaise.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks Carol
620763,102617,2011-07-18,5,This coleslaw is really good! I cut down the milk and buttermilk and also added more mayo just because I like a thicker dressing. Came out great.
222055,78579,2005-10-05,5,"I have been looking for this recipe and thanks to the last reviewer I found it! I couldn't remeber what it was called. I got this recipe a couple of years ago on another site. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! Works Great!!!"
64583,78579,2005-10-18,5,"This worked beautifully!  Thank you for suggesting this recipe in the forums.  I used my brand new sand castle bundt pan and there are many nooks and crannies.  This is the perfect way to grease the pan.  It does make a whole lot, so I wish I would've cut the recipe at least in 1/2, but I just put the leftovers in the refrigerator like you said.  "
91392,78579,2006-10-20,5,"This is what I have been looking for.  It will solve some, maybe all, of my no Pam spray in France issues.  Be sure to beat it really well, it changes consistency.  I threw mine in the Kitchen Aid and let it go for a couple of minutes.  Cheap, and so far, effective on every pan I have tried it on."
168462,78579,2006-10-27,5,"This stuff is amazing. I have an old pizza pan that I was going to throw out because everything sticks to it, but not when you use this stuff.I will be using this from now on. Thanks for the recipe."
124249,78579,2006-12-16,5,"This coating is great.

Thanks for a great baking recipe.

Bullwinkle."
37305,78579,2007-01-07,5,What can I add?  I made this because I was out of the spray and it worked like a charm on the loaf pans I made pumpkin bread in.  Thanks so much...this will be a money saver and a clean air saver (I hate the mist the spray leaves in the kitchen!).
350750,78579,2007-02-24,5,Love this! I have been using this for quite some time now.  I will not be buying the sprays anymore because I already have all the ingredients on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe.
174991,78579,2007-06-03,5,This works!  What else can I say.  I'm so tired of loosing half of my muffins to the paper liners.  Now this will not be an issue.  Looking forward to doing more baking.
132383,78579,2007-07-22,5,"I was skeptical, but now I am a believer!  I halved the recipe to just try it out and it got me about four cakes (bundt pans).  I am about to make my second batch...I love it! Thanks for posting this great solution to greasing and flouring pans."
138429,78579,2007-10-15,5,This is a new found staple in  my pantry. I used it in a few casserole dishes and they washed up beautifully. No need to use a pot scraper. Thanks Kitten for this amazing recipe.
632249,78579,2007-12-15,5,I wish I had found this years ago.  I had a bundt pan that was very decorative and no matter what I did I could never get the cake out without ruining it.  Too bad I chucked the pan in the garbage because I bet this would have worked wonders.  I have used it several times now and nothing is sticking.  Thx so much.
280166,78579,2008-01-06,5,"Love, love, love this recipe!  Thanks for posting!"
383346,78579,2008-01-20,5,I don't know why I have not try it earlier.  I should have :)  Cause it's wonderful.  It's so easy to remove when washing the dish.  Thanks Kit :)  Made for Zaar Star Game.
357358,78579,2008-02-25,5,Works exactly as promised. My gingerbread just slide out but its outside was not greasy at all. I put off trying this recipe because I worried that cleanup would be a mess. Actually the mixer and spatula cleaned up easily with soap and hot water. I have a feeling I will be baking more from now on. Thanks!
136997,78579,2008-04-11,5,"I have nothing else to add to the many reviews, other than it simply works like charm. :)"
100526,78579,2008-05-12,5,"I absolutely hate using sprays; propellants and all! ICK! This is a great way to keep things from sticking when you bake. It was wonderful on the muffins I just made and the Chocolate cake I made for my mom over the weekend. I made up a batch with the cocoa for just such an occasion.

Thanks!"
307214,78579,2008-06-06,5,"Wonderful - works with any baking.  I use it when I am kneading bread - just rub it on my hands and nothing sticks (it does feel a little strange).  Thanks!!
Just used it on a cookie sheet when I was ""frying"" potato chips -- was awesome nothing stuck to the pan!"
333017,78579,2008-08-05,5,"Ditto on all the other comments!  I cut the recipe in half and put it in a metal butter dish with a lid.  Works like a charm for any baked goods.  It doesn't totally replace my Pam, but I am finding I am reaching for this more than I am for the spray!  Wonderful idea, Kitten!"
226863,78579,2008-12-05,5,Works great!  Better than Pam or even crisco and flour!  I'll use this again.
203111,78579,2009-01-27,0,"I'm not going to rate this because I figure nearly 130 people can't be wrong.  But I wanted to say that I used this on a cookie sheet.  I now have a cookie sheet that is a mess and it's going to take me forever to get it cleaned up.  Where there wasn't food, this stuff is stuck on there worse than glue.  Don't know if I didn't stir it enough first or what but thought I should warn others of this possibility."
1072593,78579,2009-03-08,5,"Amen and hallelujah...I'm a believer! This release has the consistancy of a soft whipped frosting...looks like it, too. Very effective AND economical.--UPDATE--I've been waiting to use this on my most intricate bundt pan that almost never releases.  See Kay Demonbren's Recipe #97011 picture...perfection!"
280271,78579,2009-03-15,5,"Wow! This stuff works great. I'm so glad I came across it. Made it for ""best of 2008"" game. Thanks for posting. :)"
142559,78579,2009-08-24,5,"You are so my hero!!! This stuff is amazing!! I never thought I would be able to use my detailed pans from Williams Sonoma anymore because no matter what I used, the cakes always stuck to the pan, ruining the design. Until now!! This works like a dream!!"
768828,78579,2009-11-16,5,"I waited until I used this on several things before reviewing.  The first thing I used it for was meatloaf.  I was a little disappointed as the pan was hard to clean afterwards.  I may not have gotten the pan coated good, because I have since used the coating for bread and bread pudding and the pans cleaned very easily.  Thanks bunches Kittencal.  So much cheaper than Pam."
540346,78579,2010-01-09,5,"I just whipped up a batch with flour and a batch with cocoa powder. Super easy and it works.  I made a German chocolate cake and when it came out of the oven, it was separated from the edges of the pan perfectly!  Love it!"
400708,78579,2010-10-30,5,"I can't tell you how long ago I saved this with the intention of making it and just never seemed to get around to it.  What was I thinking!!!  Made it yesterday and it's a miracle - I love it and this will not disappear from my shelves again.  As a matter of fact, I'm making a second batch today for my DD's house.  I love the ""no chemical smell"" and it feels so much better and easy to prepare when mixed in my KA.  Thanks so much for posting."
126440,78579,2010-11-09,5,Made this and have been using it all summer and fall.  Great stuff.
2041603,78579,2011-10-27,5,"This was so easy to make. I don't buy PAM but instead usually coat the dish with a light layer of butter. I like this method better! I think I'll stick to baking cups when baking things with chunks in them, like chocolate chips and blueberries, but I will use this for all the other baked goods!"
8629,78579,2012-12-08,3,I used this on 9 inch baking pans for a cake I made.  The cake released ok but there were a few spots on the bottom of the pan where the cake did not release.
37779,55768,2004-03-01,5,"Really enjoyed this one, Barb. My husband and I thought it had lively ethnic flavors. I followed your directions exactly and didn't see the need to make any changes. I had to use store-bought tomatoes which was ok but I can't wait to try this again when fresh summer tomatoes are in season. This was our Zaar lunch of the week. Thanks."
173314,55768,2005-07-15,5,Very Good. I subbed 1 can diced tomatoes w/green chilies for the tomato and had no black beans so we used navy beans this time.  Great chilled but also wonderful heated. didnt top on rice.  THANKS!
104295,55768,2005-07-25,5,This was excellent.  My first time trying brown basmati rice and the beans and corn were wonderful with it.  I used frozen corn instead of canned and used tomatoes fresh from the garden.  I also used banana pepper instead of jalapenos because I was serving it to children.  We had it as our main course and it was plenty filling.  I think this would be an excellent potluck dish for summer cookouts.  And I also ate some of the beans with homemade baked corn chips.  Very yummy!
145352,55768,2005-08-18,4,"Nice, colorful dish. "
188119,55768,2005-09-05,5,mmm I liked this one... I think next time though I will not mix it in with the brown rice right away since some people would prefer to eat it as a salsa than with rice  (I liked it with the rice).  Plus this recipe made A LOT Of servings which was good since I made it for a party.  Thanks!
95743,55768,2005-09-11,5,"Made the entire recipe as written, with fresh corn, and plan to use the leftovers on a Tex-Mex ""pizza"" tomorrow night.  Wouldn't change a thing."
222564,55768,2005-10-24,5,"Never mind the rice, the beans themselves with other ingredients made truly delicious salad!"
121185,55768,2007-02-02,3,"Hmmmm...I was so excited to try this based on all of the rave reviews.  But we thought it was pretty bland.  I even had company over and they all agreed...BUT, it does make an exc. EASY tortilla soup.  I just dumped the mixture into some chicken broth, added a clove of garlin and some cumin - simmered it for a bit and then - YUM!"
203111,55768,2007-03-27,4,"I expected this to be good but am surprised at HOW good it is!  I used canned tomatoes and about 4 slices of jarred jalapeno and Louisiana hot sauce. I served it hot as a meal with some bread, but can't wait to try it cold, also.  Thanks, Barb!"
362983,55768,2007-04-10,5,"This is a really nice, refreshing dish. I put together everything and let it sit for an hour or two to let the flavours blend together; then I cooked the rice in the rice cooker and added the bean mixture just as the rice was done cooking to let it all heat up. The only thing I did differently was leave out the onions and jalapenos, and used lemon juice instead of lime. It was spicy on its own, but not so spicy when mixed with rice, so I'll probably up the spice next time. I'd love to use this with just about everything! Thanks!"
227607,55768,2007-06-04,5,"This is REALLY good!!!  I made a huge batch of this and put it in a wrap for lunch, made some chimichangas out of some that I had added salsa to, and put some in the freezer to have for quick lunches and dinners.  Very versatile dish."
182624,55768,2007-06-27,5,"Okay, I make new recipes from 'zaar constantly. Rarely do I repeat one on a regular basis, even if I love it, because I like to try new things constantly. Each time I make a recipe, I ask Alan, my husband, how many stars he would give it. He has never given five stars (and we're often in agreement on this, although I often add points for ease of the recipe, etc. whereas he wouldn't do that), mainly because he considers that to be a ""perfect"" recipe, and one that he could and would eat over and over again. Finally...we've got a five star recipe with this one! I was a bit skeptical when I realized we'd be putting a cold ""salad"" on hot rice, but I had no cause for worry...this was fantastic! I prefer it with extra hot sauce, but Alan loved his as is. The leftovers heated up great also, which is a huge plus for me. I did use a can of diced tomatoes, but only because I didn't have any fresh on hand. I LOVE that this is healthy, easy to make, tasted delicious, can be a main course with grilled chicken or a side dish as is, has great presentation, and makes great leftovers for lunch or another dinner. We actually piled some of the leftovers in baked potatoes with salsa...yum! Barb, you're simply the best!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...it will become the first one ever to be made weekly at our house!"
168462,55768,2007-08-27,4,I really enjoyed this recipe I made as written except I used lemon in place of lime juice as that was all I had. Very simple and tasty. Thanks for the recipe.
358796,55768,2007-08-30,5,"INCREDIBLE! I just mixed it all together. Used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and was out of jalapenos so just used extra, extra hot sauce (Cholupa). The lime and cilantro and all the fresh flavors makes this just wonderful and heats up perfect for leftovers. Will put this into regular rotation."
60260,55768,2008-01-13,5,"Excellent dish Barb!!  We were invited out last minute to a friends house who was serving enchilladas.  My FIL was visiting and is Vegan so I knew I needed to bring a dish that would work well for him also.  This one fit the bill perfectly and tasted so....good!  The tomatoes at the store were terrible so I bought canned, diced tomatoes w/green chilis and drained it well.  Everything else was as is, except I used 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper and I mixed everything together rather than just topping the rice.  We ate it at room temperature but think it would be great hot or cold too.  This recipe goes in the keeper file! Thanks. :)"
140132,55768,2008-02-21,4,This recipe was good.  We love black beans so this was a good recipe for us to try.  I will make this often this summer. Thank you for posting....Stephanie
142367,55768,2009-12-01,5,We loved this! It was so tasty.  I would make a bowl of this and mix it with Cabbage Salsa Recipe #37237 ---so good!  Thank you so much for sharing!
407007,55768,2010-01-23,5,"Absolutely fabulous and fresh tasting! I left out the rice and tomatoes, but followed the rest exactly. It tasted so great and went so well with the Recipe #28148 I served it with. Thank you so much for sharing!"
264017,55768,2010-09-04,5,"I made this with a few additions, but I'm sure it's just as delicious made as listed. I added 2 fully cooked chicken breasts and 1/2 teaspoon cumin (for some heat). Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used 2 cans of diced w/ green chiles and omitted the jalapenos listed. I ate this several days for lunch at work heated in the micro and enjoyed it so much topped w/ a small scoop of lite sour cream. I will make this often! Yum!"
456858,55768,2012-01-01,5,"This was good, and it looked pretty too, so colorful.  I hadn't been a fan of any kind of beans, and lately I have been trying to eat more black beans, so that is why I decided 2 give this recipe a try.  Glad I did, definitely will be making again."
129345,55768,2012-03-14,1,Not a favorite with this family.
126440,55768,2012-08-28,5,Great flavors in this dish.  I served it at room temp. and added a little cotija cheese.  Served with Recipe #21935.
8688,55768,2012-08-31,5,"This recipe is perfect!  It would be great served in soft tacos with a bit of guacamole as a meal.  I will make this recipe often, Barb!  Thank you!"
54678,55768,2012-09-19,4,I had some leftover cilantro lime rice so I mixed in the beans I had which were black eyed peas then pretty much followed the rest of the ingredients ..... really enjoyed this recipe and very colorful
540346,55768,2013-04-10,5,Wonderful!  I used a can of tomatoes since I was out of fresh.  I also used a 4 oz can diced chiles in place of the jalapeno and a one pound bag of frozen corn that I cooked on the stove.  I omitted the olive oil because I didn&#039;t think it was needed.  I also cooked the brown rice with some coconut oil so I figured that was a good healthy fat.  I added a chopped avocado as I was serving it.  Delicious and easy!
176615,55768,2014-02-20,5,"Yummy! Added a teaspoon of cumin, stirred it all together and served as a side dish with salsa lime chicken. Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
198154,55768,2014-08-18,4,"Made this tonight using a fresh jalapeno, tomatoes and cilantro from the garden.  So good. It&#039;s like all the yummy stuffing from our favorite burrito shop, but in a bowl. The whole family enjoyed this."
32772,55768,2014-09-28,5,"Easy, packed full of flavor, and a colorful side dish."
121185,52253,2009-03-24,4,Wow!! LOTS of chewy - pasta-ish dumplings.  my family of 5 was torn over these and our regular dumplings...
242484,52253,2006-02-13,5,"Fabulous dish!! The dumplings are the best! One tip: if you want to make the dumplings ahead, after cutting them, dip one side with a little flour so they won't stick together and put in refrigerator until you are ready to use them."
176615,52253,2006-02-19,5,"Very good! I've never made dumplings that were rolled before, and they were delicious and easy to do with the pizza cutter. I rolled out on a wax paper covered counter. Only changes I made were to use butter for margarine and 2 tablespoons chicken soup base for the bouillon cubes. I wouldn't cut down the amount of dumplings, but more chicken could be added if desired. Reheats beautifully. So comforting on a cold winter day! Thanks, Susie!"
49304,52253,2006-03-26,5,"Great Chicken & Dumplings! DH devoured them. I usely make the fluffy kind,now these will be the kind that I will be making. The recipe is very easy to make, I halved the recipe for the 2 of us, used 2 LARGE chicken breast all the veggies & spices that the recipe called for. Instead of chicken bouillion, I used chicken base. The leftovers was delicious for lunch. Thanks, Susie!"
173579,52253,2006-05-19,5,This was a very tasty meal. I had never use eggs in my dumplings but it made them so much better.  Will be using this from now on.  Thanks for posting.
59780,52253,2006-09-27,5,"Every once in awhile you come across a recipe that just knocks your socks off and this was one of those recipes!! The entire family scarfed this down and it was just so delicious! I used about a cup of <a href=""/24576"">Rescued Turkey Stock</a> and only 4 chicken boullion cubes. I frozen the leftovers in single servings so that I could reheat a small amount to stick in the thermos for lunch. Thanks so much for posting this, I will use this recipe again and again! :) "
39301,52253,2006-10-27,5,This was my first attempt at chicken and dumplings and what a success!  My husband loved this dish.  He orders chicken and dumplings at restaurants whenever he can.  Now I've got a restaurant-quality version to make right here at home.  Thank you!
280166,52253,2006-11-15,4,My family enjoyed this but we all thought 1/2 onion was overpowering.  Next time I will use green onions.
248023,52253,2007-04-25,5,"With the first hint of fall in the air, I was craving some good, simple comfort food. When I mentioned this dish to my BF, he replied, ""I've never had that!!!"". I couldn't believe it! I knew I had to make it then. I just finished preparing it, and all I can say is WOW! I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the onions, carrots and celery since we both love our vegetables! I also added an extra 1/2 c of the chicken broth at the very end as I folded in the chicken to add a little extra gravy. It was exactly what I was craving...will post again once BF gets home from work and tastes it for his very first time! Thanks Susie!"
355637,52253,2007-06-17,5,"As I was making this, I told myself ""This had better be good, cuz it is sure alot of work""... then after one bite I realized that it was totally worth the time and effort!! Used boneless chicken breasts as a time saver... will definitely make again!"
93006,52253,2007-10-14,4,Old-time comfort food worth the effort.  Only thing I would do differently is add a little Tony's to up the flavor a bit.
68460,52253,2007-10-15,5,"I finally got around to making this recipe, I've had it printed out forever.  Anyway, it's just delicious and really makes a lot of food.  My family of 3 plus 1 guest ate ourselves silly, then I sent some to my ex-husband and the guest took some home and my husband and I had enough for another full meal tonight.  I made it exactly as written, though my chicken was a 5-pounder.  Thanks for posting this comfort food, perfect for Autumn, recipe Susie!"
199792,52253,2007-10-23,5,"This is one fine recipe! I have never made this type of dumpling before and we really enjoyed the little devils. I did have to make a few changes because of what I had on hand. To start with I only made a half recipe and used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I used part water and part chicken broth as I thought the 'stock' would be a little weak without the rest of the chicken! I didn't have any celery so threw in a bit of celery salt. I used about 3 carrots cut into rounds. I did seem to run a bit short of stock so next time will increase that a bit. However, the flavour is wonderful. My family says it is a keeper and we thank you for sharing your recipe."
185285,52253,2007-11-26,5,"Again... I'm from Seattle and DH is from Georgia. ""Can you make Chicken and Dumplings?"" he says. I reply: ""You want me to dump chicken on what?"". Easy dish - the directions are great for anyone to follow. I used butter-flavored shortening and made the dumplings (per request) quite a bit larger, so the cooking time was closer to 25 minutes. I served with Buttermilk buscuits and froze the remainders for lunches. Thanks for a great recipe!"
88099,52253,2007-12-01,5,This was an exellent Chicken and Dumpling recipes.  Full of flavor and just what we were looking for.  The dumplings were excellent although next time I'll only make half because I couldn't fit them all into my largest pot.  This recipe is a little work but so worth the effort.  I've had this recipe saved in my cookbook for some time and am so glad I finally got around to making it.  Thanks Susie.  Just wonderful.
95743,52253,2008-01-15,5,Perfect dumpling ingredients no matter how you cook your chicken.
140132,52253,2008-01-23,5,Very good.  The flavor was very good.  I really liked the idea of adding the chicken broth into the dumplings.  And the whole dish was very comforting and warm on these cold nights....yummy. I will definately make this again.....Stephanie
125640,52253,2008-02-13,5,"More work and takes longer than my usual chicken and dumplings recipe, but tasty. Thanks."
377581,52253,2008-06-07,4,This was tasty. The dumplings in this recipe are awesome and there were plenty to go around. Great recipe. Thanks!
47559,52253,2008-08-10,5,"I've had this in my cookbook to try for a long time, and I'm so glad I finally did.  There were three of us this evening, and all agreed it was the best we'd ever had.  I made 1/2 of the dumpling recipe, and it seemed the bowl was about half and half dumplings and chicken.  The dumplings absorbed a lot of the liquid and we liked it that way.  For leftovers though, I'll add more chicken stock. Fabulous recipe, Susie."
499050,52253,2008-09-22,4,Very Good!
285039,52253,2008-11-10,5,I made this for dinner tonight and my whole family loved it. I did cheat a bit; I did not make the dumplings. Instead I added a package of Colavita premade Gnocchi. It made it easy enough for a week night dinner! (The rating is for the broth portion only -- which was very good)
377039,52253,2009-03-04,0,"I made too many changes to give a star rating. This was pretty good. I increased the veggies quite a bit and added a little diced potato as well. I forgot the garlic. I made the dumplings, dropped one in to see how it would taste and it puffed beautifully and tasted great.  Dinner was about two hours away so I let them rest until shortly before serving time, then dumped them all in and boiled. These didn't puff up at all and were very dense (because they'd rested? Because the soup was overcrowded? I don't know).  It was pretty tasty but I didn't enjoy the texture of the dumplings.  The soup had a faint, bitter aftertaste. I'm not sure what I did to cause that, but I am sure it was my fault and not the recipe's.  This did get rave reviews, but I wasn't wow'd by it. I may try again. It did smell fantastic!"
400708,52253,2009-06-20,5,"With 182 reviews why add mine.  Because this is sooooo good I just cannot skip it.  Which I could give it 10 stars and it still won't be enough.  I've never made dumplings before but was always interested.  When a neighbor had surgery I thought this would be the perfect dinner to take to them.  I sure was right, I made it exactly as printed except cut the dumplings in half.  That was plenty for us, the only thing I think I did wrong was roll the dumplings to thick but the taste was still awesome.  Next time I'll know better, and there sure will be a next time.  DH AND the neighbor declared this the best chicken soup they'd ever had and the dumplings made it all that much better.  Thanks Susie for a recipe that is being moved to my favs."
371738,52253,2009-06-23,4,Super tasty; I just halved the dumpling amount.
1122161,52253,2010-10-16,5,"WoW! This one is a real keeper! Not the easiest thing in the world to put together, but the instructions are like gold! This was really homey- delicious Thanks so much for taking the time to instruct on making the perfect chicken n dumplins in my opinion!"
251626,52253,2012-07-06,5,Excellent
198154,52253,2012-10-14,4,"This makes a lot of dumplings.  I only cooked half because I was afraid I wouldn't have enough broth once I added my chicken back in.  I probably could have made more than I did.  This recipe was good and could probably serve more than it states, but that's ok, it just means more leftovers for us.  A great rainy day meal."
2549237,52253,2013-03-03,3,"The chicken and gravy in this were delicious, but the dumplings were really doughy and heavy.  I will make this again but use mini biscuits instead."
350750,52253,2014-02-23,5,"Very satisfying on a cold winter evening.  I did cook the chicken the night before, also skimmed the fat off the broth. This was great because of all the dumplings.  Thank you!"
8688,150863,2006-02-04,5,"Wonderful! Spicy and creamy, this makes a great winter's day meal served with some crispy bread and a tossed salad!  Thanks for sharing, Shawn : )"
36944,150863,2006-11-01,0,This went together very quickly and uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I added some garlic powder and then adjusted the red pepper after tasting it.  It was a good soup on a chilly night.
53932,150863,2006-12-02,4,"I liked this, but am not sure that I loved the cream cheese in the soup. I might substitute some cheese for a portion of the cream cheese next time.  I added some bacon for a little extra flavor."
169969,150863,2007-02-11,4,Pretty good potato soup. I thought it needed something to balance out the strong cream cheese flavor. I added bacon for a little more flavor. Thanks Chef.
285039,150863,2007-07-10,5,"This recipe took less than an hour for me to prepare, and it was very easy! Perhaps I cut the potatoes smaller and they cooked faster.  I thought the soup was a bit thick, but it might be because I mashed to many of the potatoes.  Overall, a very tasty recipe and I will definitely make it again."
373817,150863,2007-08-08,5,"Yum! This was very easy to make! It tasted amazing and my toddler loved it as well! It was so creamy and rich. I halved the recipe, since it was for just the two of us. It worked great! Thanks! I will be making this many more times!"
400708,150863,2007-10-02,5,"Wonderful, warm, cozy soup for these cooler fall days.  So easy to make and good instructions.  I did add a 1tsp of minced garlic and 1 slice of bacon cooked and crumbled to this as a personal preferance and it was sooooo good.  Enjoyed by all, I've frozen the left overs and will have to see how that turns out.  Thanks Shawn for a recipe my whole family, including picky DGSs all enjoyed."
251917,150863,2007-10-11,5,OMG - this was awesome!! It's amazing that so few ingredients can produce such an incredible soup and how quickly you can make this!! I made a batch and a half of this last night (ate 2 huge bowls myself) and packed up the rest for my hubby and I for lunch today!! Just the right amount of spices without it being too spicy!!
74281,150863,2007-10-24,5,"FABULOUS soup! My family declared it was ""the best soup"" I ever made. I did add a 7-oz can of green chilies with the potatoes. Also had shredded cheese on the side for garnish. We will have this a lot this winter!"
229524,150863,2007-11-03,5,"WOW, WOW, and WOW!!!!!! Love this soup.  Great flavor.  So easy to make.  Put it on to cook and was able to go do a few other things until the potatoes were done.  Added chopped green onions and Hormel Real Crumbbled Bacon. Top notch soup:)  Thanks so much Shawn H, will be making this often."
124190,150863,2007-12-07,5,"This is soooooo good! I've made it twice. The first time I made it as written. The second time I added smoked sausage and a little bit of dill, as well as some cheddar cheese. I like it the way it's written for lunch, and with smoked sausage for dinner. Yum! Thanks!"
318235,150863,2008-02-20,3,Thank you.
140806,150863,2008-11-11,5,"DH wanted to make a nice soup in honor of the rainy day we had, but I didn't want the French Onion he was suggested. I pulled this up as an alternative. He was extremely skeptical but agreed to make it anyway. Over the course of the day, we devoured the whole pot, nearly licking it clean. Simply excellent. Thickened up nicely once we mashed up some of the potatoes. We added a little Tony's Creole Seasoning. DH liked his with bacon bits, I ate mine with extra pepper. Would also be great with corn or jalapenos."
229850,150863,2008-12-15,5,"This was very good. I too had trouble getting the cream cheese to melt. I cut it into very small pieces, and let it get to room temperature, but still had trouble. I had to really mash them. I did saute the onions before adding them, and I did garnish with some bacon. Despite the problems with the cream cheese and it was very runny, the taste was terrific. So I will too add more potatoes next time, and work on a solution to the cream cheese. I did double this recipe and wish I had more LOL Thought it was wonderful, and so did the family. Thanks for a great dish on this cold icy day !!"
131021,150863,2008-12-21,4,"We really liked this. We froze half of it. I would like to make it with a little more seasoning, maybe some garlic. I served shredded cheese, crumbled bacon and green onions on top."
485151,150863,2009-02-03,5,"I loved this potato soup! It's exactly what I've been looking for. No more trying different recipes- this is a keeper! And the great thing is this is simpler than other recipes I've liked! I pretty much followed the recipe with only small changes. I like lots of potatoes in my soup and probably used more than 4 cups. (I used 12 med size ones). Consequently I used a little more broth to have enough to cover the taters. Since I like my potato soup thick I added some instant potato flakes before the cream cheese. I didn't measure, guessing maby 1/3 cup."
142335,150863,2009-02-06,5,"This is delicious! I used chicken stock and added diced potatoes until they were just covered with the stock. I was making this to satisfy a craving when friends called (at dinner time) and wanted to stop by and maybe eat, lol. I wouldn't normally serve soup to guests for dinner but I had no choice and I'm glad it was this soup. I served toppings to go along with this: crumbled bacon, green onions and I shredded some sharp cheddar. There were four of us and no leftovers. I'll be making this again soon. Thanks!"
222564,150863,2009-02-14,4,"Lovely soup! I use bouillon cubes to make broth, all 4 for this one and it was mighty tasty. I actually skipped the seasoning salt or any kind of salt."
252816,150863,2009-03-18,5,"Were leaving for a few days and I wanted to use up some things in the refrig..I increased the broth by 1 cup,I used 1/4 cup green onions chopped fine,I used 2 leftover baked potatoes,shredded.And added 1/2 tsp black pepper,1/2 tsp salt reduced red pepper to 1/8 and served with crispy bacon crumbled on top of each bowl of soup..My DH said its the best potaot soup Ive ever made yet..I added shredded baked potaotes to pot when I did the light mash made a nice flavorful,thickier soup.....I will be making this again..Thank U for this recipe....."
808027,150863,2009-03-26,5,Unbelievably good!  This just might be the best soup I've ever had.  It is very rich and tastes like it is loaded with cream and probably about 1000 calories per serving.  Made exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing...perfectly seasoned.  It went together very quickly and was a meal in itself with some crusty bread.  THANK YOU for posting this fantastic recipe!!!
187373,150863,2009-05-10,5,"Yum!  I left out the salt completely since I thought it was salty enough with the chicken bouillon cubes I used; added two minced garlic cubes and subbed low fat cream cheese.  I definitely recommend this soup!  It was delicious and creamy.  For us, this recipe made about 3-4 servings--not 6. (And usually I half soup recipes that serve 4 b/c they usually serve twice that!)"
389431,150863,2009-10-15,5,Super easy to make and used up ingredients I had setting in my fridge... Tasted great too with green onions and cheddar cheese sprinkled on top!  Thanks so very much!
111291,150863,2009-10-17,5,"i know this recipe really doesn't need another review but i just have to say ""yep, this is indeed really, really good!""  i followed the recipe as posted.  i used low fat cream cheese and placed the whole block in the microwave for about 30 secs and then when it was in the soup, broke up the smaller lumps by using a hand whisk - worked great!"
199792,150863,2009-10-18,5,"This is a very good soup, one bowl is definitely enough as it is very rich even with using low fat cream cheese. I think next time I will decrease the amount of cream cheese.  I loved the bit of heat from the red peppers (I used crushed). I followed someone's suggestion and sprinkled crumbled bacon on top which really added to the dish. There is one bowl left and I have already claimed it for my work lunch. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
173314,150863,2009-10-19,5,great soup....try my bread bowl recipe #394411. is delicious!
1179225,150863,2009-10-24,5,Delicious! We really liked this. I did add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of season salt and used low sodium broth. I I prepared the soup early in the day and then kept it warm in the crockpot until ready to serve. We topped ours with green onions and cheddar cheese. It couldn't have been any easier and tasted perfect on a cold fall night. Thanks for posting.
173579,150863,2009-10-28,5,This was very good and creamy soup.  This was even better the next day.  Thanks for posting.
52262,150863,2009-11-05,5,Yummy and very easy to make!  I used 1/2 cup diced onion and about 4 1/2-5 cups potatoes (I forgot to measure my biggest potato.).  I used reduced fat cream cheese and added it once the potatoes were tender.  I stirred to melt the cream cheese some and then used my emmersion blender to puree the soup.  My kids are more likely to eat it if the ingredients aren't noticable.
227607,150863,2009-11-07,5,This was an amazing soup!  I had leftover cubed potatoes with skin on that had some seasoning on them already.  I used those and followed the directions except for cooking the potatoes.  I left the cream cheese out to soften then stuck it in the microwave for like 15 seconds to really soften it and it worked fine.  everyone loved this soup.
189475,150863,2009-12-20,5,"This was really good and very filling. I didn't have white or red pepper so I used black pepper instead and it still turned out great. I think this is one of the best soups I have ever had in my life, so I really appreciate the recipe! I stirred the soup with a wire whisk to get the cream cheese to finish melting quicker, because the soup smelled so good that I didn't feel like waiting another 5 mins for it to melt! I made some bread in my bread maker and served that with it and it was a very delicious (and cheap) dinner. Next time I might try adding in a small can of corn."
439797,150863,2009-12-28,5,I've made this twice in the last two weeks.  It's delicious!  Made some bacon to go on it last time.  Extra tasty!
198154,150863,2010-01-07,4,"My husband was reading the ingredients and I thought he said celery salt. So I put in 1/2 teaspoon celery salt instead of seasoned salt.  That being said it still turned out pretty good.  My daughter added bacos, sour cream and shredded chedder to the top of hers and it was even better.  Can't wait to see how it is when I use the correct ingredients!!"
140132,150863,2010-01-21,5,"I doubled this recipe and am so glad I did.  This is a fantastic potato soup recipe.  We added celery salt to the soup at the table.....mmmmmm.  Thank you so much for sharing, we loved it."
359220,150863,2010-01-25,5,"This soup hit the spot on a cold, windy evening!  Quick, simple and delish...I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and didn't miss the fat at all.  I might even try the fat free type next time!  Thanks Shawn H."
158086,150863,2010-04-07,5,This is really really good......I tripled the recipe...and addewd a tough of hevay whicpping cream and some cheddar cheese...used 1/3 less fat cream cheese....a great tasting fast soup.
255338,150863,2010-08-18,5,"Sauteeing the onions prior to boiling them to make the soup would definitely make it taste richer, but even without this step, the soup still cooked up delicious. After smashing the potatoes, the soup thickened considerably so that not much stirring was needed upon adding the cream cheese to it. Easy preparation. This was inhaled by my children. Thank you for sharing."
371738,150863,2010-09-19,5,"I inadvertently forgot the onions, but my family didn't mind.  My youngest gobbled down two bowls.  I did use 1/2 the cream cheese amount and that was enough for him.  Thanks for a new addition to the soup rotation!"
1133190,150863,2010-12-01,0,"Great Recipe! Thanks for sharing. I used more potatoes than the recipe called for and used some Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic seasoning in place of the seasoning salt.  I think I'll try adding some carrots and celery next time as suggested by others. Made again in 2010, still awesome!"
199020,150863,2012-06-03,5,"OMG This is delicious! I even cheated and used diced hash brown potatoes instead of peeling and cutting my own! Why didn't I think of that before?! I will never peel another potato again! I was afraid the cream cheese would make it too creamy, but it's perfect! I added some chives, and kept everything else the same. Definitely a keeper!"
174991,150863,2012-10-16,5,This soup was the answer to a cold Fall day and is TDF.  I baked the potatoes and then peeled and cubed them.  I blended the cream cheese with some of the broth and added some fresh rosemary.  I followed the recipe as stated and topped it with some shredded cheddar cheese and copped bacon.  I will use this a base for other dishes like clam chowder or ham chowder and add shredded carrots and leeks.
529278,150863,2013-01-31,5,"I haven't been able to branch out from Panera's broccoli cheddar soup, so I have no idea if this is really the same.  What I do know is my 7 and 5 year olds both loved it, so it's a winner in my book!  We did double the season salt, just because  potato soup can be bland.  It certainly had flavor.  I used a package of thawed hash brown potatoes to cut the work down.  This was a snap to put together.  We grated cheddar on top and cooked some turkey bacon to crumble on top as well.  Our soon used his bacon as his spoon :)"
178742,150863,2013-02-12,5,"Excellent! We enjoyed it! The only thing I did different was as one reviewer suggested, I baked my potatoes in the micowave instead of boiling. And I sauteed my onion in butter along with some minced garlic. Topped with cheddar cheese when served. I posted picture too. Thanks for sharing!"
98919,150863,2014-10-13,5,AWESOME! I made as directed except I added 1 t. garlic powder &amp; 1-2 t. of dill weed. I used an immersion blender to make it creamy &amp; smooth. Thanks for posting...it is a keeper!
1581225,150863,2014-10-20,4,"I didn&#039;t mind this, neither did my husband, but its probably not something I would make again or add to our regular rotation. The main reason being the kids weren&#039;t fans. As I always say, it was worth a try!"
894666,150863,2015-12-10,5,"Delicious and easy to modify to your taste! I skipped peeling the potatoes, the skins add nice texture since I blend my soup in the blender (after cooling of course). Also, I used 4 oz of shredded Mexican cheese and 4 oz of fat free cream cheese (let it set to room temperature, it will melt easier into the soup).

Just made this again, doubled it for 5 people. Used only green onion and a tsp of garlic saut&eacute;ed in butter first, and added a thing of cooked bacon. The 3 kids of the house all had dental work/wisdom teeth pulled today, and even they commented on how good it was. Thanks, this was scrumpsh!"
68460,124249,2005-10-14,4,"This pie is delicious, though very sweet and very rich.  Next time I make this I'll use a deep dish pie dish as the filling overflowed and I was very glad I had placed a sheet of foil on a lower shelf of the oven to catch the drippings.  Also, the crust browned pretty fast so I would suggest lining the crust edges with foil to protect them a bit.  All in all, a good recipe...very nice looking pie and quite tasty!  Thanks for posting this Pepper!"
188119,47907,2006-04-19,5,Very good.  I also like that is very high in protein.  I used half wheat and half white flour and so the mix was a little dry and I had to add more water (maybe 1/4 cup).  It still came out fine.  Thanks a lot!
13483,9836,2001-11-12,5,I can only ditto what the others have said.  This was a terrific dish.  I had enough leftovers for a cheesy chicken open face hot sandwich for dinner tonight.  Great crockpot recipe.
18391,9836,2002-01-30,4,This was good .. But i had to thicken the sauce a little ..
28649,9836,2002-02-26,5,Very easy and very good.  I used broccoli/cheese soup instead of just cheese soup.  Even my very picky 11yr old liked it and she doesn't like very much.  I will make this again!!!
7108,9836,2002-06-17,5,"Very good!  The only prep time is making sure you defrost any frozen chicken and opening up soup can lids! I threw it together in the am before a busy day and DH made the noodles and fed him and my son while I was at work.  It's a keeper, I got compliments from DH. Thanks for posting, I am always looking for crockpot recipes to try!"
60992,9836,2002-11-14,4,"I tried this after all the high ratings and was disappointed.  These ingredients are all so yummy why didn't it have much flavor?  I added more garlic and still no flavor. I won't give up though..next time I add some wine, herbs and veggies. I think it has potential, but for me, this wasn't quite ""it"". Not inedible by far, but just more basic than my tastebuds like."
37868,9836,2003-02-09,5,This a keeper here everyone loved it. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and used boneless skinless thighs. The gravy was so very good over mashed potatoes. Thank You
64934,9836,2003-03-20,5,"Made this for supper tonight, exactly as the recipe stated, and it was fantastic!  So quick and easy, yet so very tasty!  I served this with noodles tonight, but next time I'm going to make rice with it. "
32772,9836,2003-06-17,5,This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it many times. The only thing I would suggest is add 6 boneless skinless chicken breast to the recipe for the amount of soup mix used. It makes a wonderful sauce to go over pasta or rice.
35526,9836,2003-06-22,5,Great flavor.  I added some mushrooms before it was done and served over noodles with broccoli.  My guests put more sauce over everything and sopped up the extra with bread.  I used the low sodium/low fat soups.
59780,9836,2004-01-10,5,"Another quick and easy crock pot recipe! I did add 2 crushed garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Will be making this again soon, thanks!"
59163,9836,2004-01-17,4,"This was so easy and tasty. I used the leftover chicken the next day for quesadillas, they were delicious. "
60989,9836,2004-05-12,4,"This is a snap to throw together and the flavor is very good. The chicken was tender and completely cooked after 8 1/2 hours. The sauce was very good on broccoli and on egg noodles.
Thanks!"
140806,9836,2004-07-14,5,"My husband was THRILLED that I was making him a dish just for him> I don't benefit much because I am vegetarian. I didn't have cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom, which worked splendidly. Thank you for such a wonderful and easy recipe. "
88099,9836,2006-02-23,5,"I put this together yesterday morning with frozen chicken and had my daughter turn it on before she went to work.  It cooked a little over 9 hours and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  Very moist and tender.  We served this over rice and all enjoyed.  I did use fresh minced garlic, but other than that didn't change a thing.  Thanks."
74652,9836,2006-04-02,4,Really easy! I love this because I can cook this all day while at work.
140132,9836,2007-01-30,5,"This is very good.  Easy too.  I didn't cook it is a crockpot as I left without starting it....lol.  So when i got home i cooked it on the stovetop.  I cubed the chicken and then browned it first. I served it on split biscuits for something different and it was fabulous.  I will make again in the crockpot as written but wanted to share my ""unplanned"" version too.  Thank you for a great meal....Stephanie"
324621,9836,2007-02-22,4,Good stuff. Super simple and very tender! I also served over noodles with fresh green beans on the side. Thanks for the recipe!
80998,9836,2007-04-02,3,"I have had this in my cookbook for a long time.  I finally decided to make it.  It was very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was good.  The kids liked it because I told them it was macaroni and cheese with chicken mixed in it.  However, my husband and I just thought it was okay."
189616,9836,2007-07-16,5,"Delish! I used 4 frozen chicken breasts, only used one can of the cream of chicken soup and some Emeril Essence. This was falling apart tender at 6 hours with alot of thin gravy so I added cooked egg noodles directly to the crockpot and it absorbed the gravy which was great since the chicken was shredding. Served this with recipe#230038 Great supper!"
265954,9836,2007-07-25,5,"This is a wonderful dish b/c it allows so many variations.  I made this today with 1 1/4 lbs. of chicken breast, two 10 1/2 oz. cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup, one 4 oz. can of sliced mushrooms (drained) and 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, along with all the other spices listed.  I cooked it on high in the crock pot for five hours total.  On the fourth hour, I transfered the chicken breasts to a plate, shredded the chicken with a knife and fork so that it looked like pulled chicken and then put it back into the crock pot to cook for another hour.  The chicken was INCREDIBLY tender.  The only one issue I had (and this may have been my fault) was that there was some sticking and browning on the sides of the crock pot.  Other than that, this leads to a flavorful, thick sauce that goes great with the shredded chicken, and which I served over wide egg noodles.  Thanks so much for posting!"
359220,9836,2007-08-02,4,"This great crockpot meal will definitely make a return appearance in my home.  I can see serving this meal over some homemade mashed potatoes this winter!  Super quick to throw together, cooked on low for 8 hours, then shredded chicken.  Thought I had egg noodles to serve it on, but had to use rice instead...still delicious and the chicken breasts were soooo tender and tasty.  Thanks!"
218535,9836,2007-08-12,3,This is good but I have a recipe which my family like better - 2lbs of chicken and 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup; cook low 6-8 hours in crockpot.
184723,9836,2007-09-30,5,"I've been sick and wanted something easy to throw into the crockpot for my family and this not only was super easy... but they all loved it as well!  My year and 1/2 year old GOBBLED this down with noodles... I think he ate more than my husband.  Thanks for posting, I will definitely use this recipe again! OH - I used frozen tenderloins and they were done in 4 hours on low."
331557,9836,2007-12-11,3,"This is a basic recipe to start off with.  I did make some modifications to it as I knew as posted it would be bland.  I added about six cloves of crushed garlic, 1/2 cup of onions, some cumin, pepper and I dumped egg noodles and peas right into the sauce.  Thanks for posting an easy to make recipe that you can change easily!"
125640,9836,2007-12-29,3,"I followed the directions except that I added frozen broccoli to round out the meal. I served it over rice. It was really quick and easy to prep. It tasted decent, but bland. I would add some spices next time to give it a bit more flavor. It would also be better to cut the chicken into smaller pieces so that what flavor there is has more of a chance to soak in. Thanks for sharing."
389431,9836,2008-02-13,5,This was good! We used only 3 chicken breasts and one can each of the soups. We also added about 1/2 tsp of cyanne pepper for spice and 1/2 a small jar of pimentos for color. I'm looking forward to trying other variations of this recipe! Thanks so much!!
222433,9836,2008-09-23,4,Yummy recipe!  Served it over egg noodles. Next time I think I will cut the chickn up before cooking. It's a keeper!
579298,9836,2008-10-05,2,"I guess I expected this to be heavenly, even though it was mostly processed ingredients. I should have known better. If you like creamed soups (from a can) - go for it! If you're like me, and you like more tedious meals, maybe a different route would be better."
486718,9836,2008-10-06,4,This was pretty good.  I expected a little more flavor but will have to play around with it for next time.  Thanks!!
969481,9836,2008-11-28,4,"This is really good. We add bell peppers (red & green) along with sliced green onions and Tobasco pepper sauce for color and spice. Perfect over buttered egg noodles. I also found that even if the chicken is still frozen when you put it in the crock pot, it still comes out very moist after the 6 - 8 hours of cooking."
74281,9836,2009-03-06,5,We all loved this recipe. by the time i got home from work the house smelled awsome and the chicken was fall apart tender. I served this over egg noodles and with my Recipe #265779 and even my very picky 7-year old grandson ate a huge bowl. With 250 reviews to date I am not surpised this turned out to be so fantastic!
426903,9836,2009-10-12,3,"This recipe is definitely missing something. It was ok by itself, but I could see more added to it to make it so much better, maybe some broccoli? I will try it with something more next time. Thanks for the starting point."
369715,9836,2012-05-17,4,"This was good and easy to make. I did change it up though. I made this in a pan on the grill. I used six boneless skinless chicken breasts, a can of cream of chicken, a can of cheddar cheese soup, garlic powder and pepper. I cooked these for 30 minutes. We all enjoyed this with the changes made."
789516,9836,2012-05-28,5,5 stars for being the easiest chicken Ive ever made and it tasted good too!  halved the recipe using 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cheddar soup.  put breasts in frozen for 4 hours on low and they were perfect.  threw some broccoli in at the end.
768828,9836,2012-08-07,5,"Oh wow, this was so good.  I only had three chicken breasts - wish I would have had more.  Next time, for sure, I will.  I didn't have chedder cheese soup, so used cream of mushroom and added some shredded sharp chedder cheese and a little milk.  Yummy sauce."
198154,9836,2012-09-05,4,"I served this tonight over noodles with steamed broccoli on the side.  I felt it could use a little more seasoning, but all in all, we enjoyed it.  Even put the sauce on the broccoli!  Super easy to throw together and the family gave it four stars."
1581225,9836,2017-08-09,0,I won't give this a star rating because I changed it by necessity (no cheddar cheese soup available here) I just improvised and used the chicken coup and cream cheese. Turned out nice.
37868,27733,2002-11-12,5,This is a very easy recipe and as all has stated gone in a flash. Very tender and with a very good taste. We like spicy next time I wll add Chipolte. Thank You for a wonderful recipe.
29014,27733,2003-03-17,5,"Made these for an appetizer party, and what a hit!  One guest said ""This is the best thing I've ever tasted!"".  I used Italian breadcrumbs, too, and added just a touch of garlic salt.  This recipe is a definite keeper!"
93006,27733,2004-01-23,4,Excellent flavor.  I did have to double the amount of breadcrumb mixture.  Would have liked them a little crisper - maybe I should bake longer?  The leftovers did crisp up a little bit when reheated in a toaster oven.
255338,27733,2006-10-10,4,"A little salt would make this dish better. I will try it again and I know next time, with the added salt, this would be a 5 star recipe. Thank you for posting."
52543,27733,2004-02-05,5,"Absolutely delicious! I added Italian Blend Spice Mix (recipe #38293) to the bread crumbs and served with a choice of store bought Ranch Dip and my own Garlic Dipping Sauce (recipe #72048) - what can I say, I love garlic! Next time I won't use an air-bake cookie sheet as they took 20 minutes to cook & didn't really brown up. Thanx Mirj! "
64934,27733,2004-02-09,5,"Great!  I followed the recipe to a T, except I let the chicken marinate for about 2 hours!  The cayenne pepper mixed with the breadcrumbs gave them a nice spicy coating!  I baked mine for about 15 minutes and served them with some sweet and sour sauce for dipping!  These will be a regular item on our menu!  Thanks Mirj!"
13483,27733,2004-05-24,5,Perfect for part of a buffet dinner I had for friends.  Great to be able to do this ahead then pull it out and serve later.  Great taste too.  Thanks Mirj for another great recipe.
55729,27733,2004-08-02,5,"I have already made this twice in 2 weeks! The marinade is enough to do about twice the amount of meat. I really can't think of a way to improve this - but I might use homemade bread crumbs next time (whole wheat) instead of store bought. The kids loved it, too."
64203,27733,2004-12-16,5,"With 52 reviews so far, there isn't much more to say except to ditto what has already been said! These were delicious...excellent spicy flavor and very easy to put together. I cut up the chicken using kitchen shears and baked for 15 minutes. I thought it was going to be too spicy for my kids, but my 3 year old went back for thirds! Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!"
68460,27733,2005-02-12,5,"Delicious!  I made this as a very quickie week-night dinner and only let it marinate for 15 minutes.  Used a 1 lb. package of chicken tenders.  My daughter had dinner in her and she was out the door in 45 minutes.  Thanks for posting this Mirj, we enjoyed it very much :)"
37449,27733,2005-03-18,4,"I made these for my DH and he liked them. He did mention that they could use more flavor, so I will be using these for chicken alfredo  and will try with other sauces. Thanks Mirj!"
68884,27733,2005-08-18,4,"I made these awhile back & forgot to review! These are quick and really tasty. I increased the cayenne pepper a bit, and served with sauteed zucchini and a salad. A quick weeknight meal, or a good appetizer :)"
347822,27733,2006-11-16,4,"Good and pretty easy to whip up. I used 3 garlic gloves, 4 I thought was too much.  To the chicken marinade I added fresh parsley. To the bread crumb mix (used plain) I added a little salt and freshly chopped parsley (about 1 tbsp) and freshly shredded parmesan(about 1/4 cup). THX for the posting."
51011,27733,2006-11-26,5,"Wow!  I have had this recipe on my list to try forever.  Decided to throw it together tonight for an easy dinner.  Thanks for sharing!  So good, and easy- no changes necessary.  Ended up making Recipe #58125 as a dipping sauce to go with it.  Yum!"
33159,27733,2006-12-26,4,We really enjoyed this recipe!  Nice flavour.  This would be great as an appetizer but we used as a main dish with rice & veggies.
119466,27733,2007-02-11,5,"Great little bites. I didn't measure the breadcrumbs, but am sure I used more than called for. I ran some past-its-prime French bread through the food processor, then added a good amount of spicy creole seasoning and gave it a few more whirls. I love cayenne, but wanted a blend of seasonings, rather than just the cayenne. We all loved them, Mirj--thanks for posting!"
315055,27733,2007-02-20,2,They were greasy and I didn't have dipping sauce so as-is they were pretty gross.
371738,27733,2007-05-30,3,"My husband and I liked them.  Kids didn't.  Too garlicky for them.  Pretty good for baked chicken - usually they are too dry and need to be dipped in something.  Not the case with these.  If I do make it again, I will lessen the amount of garlic for the kids."
355637,27733,2007-06-21,3,"These were super easy and a tasty little meal... nothing really ""wowed"" me about them, but they were worth my time!"
520150,27733,2007-07-15,4,These were wonderfully garilicy.  I liked the addition of the cayenne as well.  Very tasty.  We had some bbq dipping sauce on the side.  I really liked the ease.  I think I may play around a bit with the recipe.  Maybe add parmesan cheese.  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe
76951,27733,2007-09-09,4,Very good.  I may have overdone on the cayenne but that's OK.  I served them with blue cheese dressing.  They were like buffalo wings without the bones!!  Very quick and easy to make.
188119,27733,2007-12-16,5,"These were really fast and were a very last minute addition at a party I was at. I used italian-style breadcrumb and made these fondue style.  After making this recipe, I got my fondue pot and filled it with one jar of marinara sauce and maybe 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and let it melt.  People then used a fondue fork to dip it into the mixture to eat.  It was really tasty, thanks!"
125640,27733,2008-01-26,3,"Super quick and easy. The first time I made this, the chicken was moist and tender, but DH thought it was too spicy and we both thought it could have used more garlic. I expected when I cut the cayenne and added more garlic this time everyone would love it. I'm surprised so many reviewers thought that there was way too much garlic (maybe some people are managing to get more of the garlic from the marinade into the final product than I am?); I upped it to 6 cloves and it wasn't too garlicky for us; with less cayenne it was really just kind of boring. Don't know if I'll make this again, but thanks for sharing. It was worth a try or two."
265954,27733,2008-01-28,5,"Outstanding! Great recipe for parties, or for the kiddies. I used 3 teaspoons of crushed garlic out of a jar instead of minced cloves, and marinated the chicken for 3 hours. I also used slightly more than 1/2 c. breadcrumbs, and used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper. Baked for 12 minutes. Great garlicky taste. Perfect inside. Served with white rice and pork and beans. Thanks for this keeper of a recipe!"
248023,27733,2008-01-30,5,Yum!!!  These would make great appys for Super Bowl Sunday!!!  I used breast tenderloins and marinated for about 1 hour.  I minced the garlic very finely and the end result was wonderful!!!  I did have to use a little more than 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs since I could not drain the oil very well.  I served them with Recipe #183144 and a loaded baked potato.  Great recipe to use up tenderloins for us... Thanks for posting!!!
218535,27733,2008-07-23,4,I am giving this 4 stars because I agree with SilverOpera that the coating didn't crisp up very well.
222564,27733,2012-09-13,5,Great recipe! I added some salt to marinade and Italian seasoning to the crumbs. The four of us didn't take long to finish these off.
666723,27733,2008-08-26,5,"I'm giving this 5 stars because I got 2 picky eaters to enjoy these!  I used seasoned breadcrumbs and went light on the cayenne.  I love hot, but the kids don't!  I let it marinate for about an hour and made these more into strips than into bites.  Really easy and my strips baked for about 20 minutes."
88099,27733,2008-09-01,4,These were very nice and quick to put together.  I doubled the garlic and the cayenne pepper and used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs which gave it a nice flavor.  Cooking time was right on.  Used this to top off a salad for dinner tonight.  Thanks.  Made for I Recommend Tag Game.
64583,27733,2008-09-24,5,These are delicious - tender and flavorful.  Such an easy recipe to throw together.  I made as you posted except that I found 1/4 cup oil was sufficient.   Thanks for posting.
140132,27733,2009-03-24,5,"So good, so easy and a great recipe to prepare.  I made these for game night and my family loved them.  I plan on making them this fall for football Saturdays as I know my guests will lvoe them.  My kids want me to make them this weekend for dinner.  Thank you for posting this highly loved recipe."
357358,27733,2009-06-05,4,"Lovely! I made them with just garlic powder and omitted the cayenne because the picky kid was going to eat them, but you can bet I will make as directed next time. Thanks, Mirj!"
928301,27733,2009-07-30,4,"Very easy to prepare  Nice and quick, and they taste a lot better than frozen store bought chicken nuggets; however I want a bit more flavor so I'll probably add some onion powder or other herbs next time.  But the chicken was moist and I love that I didn't have to use 1300 different utensils, dishes and measuring tools.  Thanks."
844554,27733,2009-12-01,5,"We enjoyed these very much! I added more cayenne pepper but other than that, made as is. Going in make again file. Thanks for this one. Made for I Recommend Tag Game 2009."
27643,27733,2010-01-01,5,"Wow, this is so good. I made this as written, no changes. I did double the recipe, and I'm glad I did. Lots of flavor for little work. Everyone loved this. The garlic and cayenne go well together.. I will definitely save it to my favorites!! Thanks Mirj!"
40961,27733,2010-01-04,5,Excellent way to make chicken. I used Italian flavored panko instead of breadcrumbs. Everyone loved it!
532289,27733,2010-05-24,5,Simple and good.  Thanks for sharing.
280166,27733,2010-07-26,4,"We used these for a graduation party.  They were very well received.  I did add some cornmeal, garlic and canned parmesan cheese to the coating.  Thanks for posting!"
1122161,27733,2010-08-17,5,Great coating for chicken! Loved it! Thanks for posting!
1269015,27733,2010-08-31,4,"I made a tofu version of this that wasn't good on its own, but which got devoured once we coated it in barbecue sauce. :)"
1179225,27733,2012-11-26,5,Excellent little chicken bites! Quick prep with tasty results. I used Italian breadcrumbs and added some shallot salt for a little more flavor. My oven temp is off a little so I had to bake them for about 17 mins. I served them with a little bbq sauce for a tasty dinner. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
32772,57130,2003-06-19,5,"I have made this recipe with Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup and a can of sliced mushrooms. A quick gravy to serve over noodles or mashed potatoes. Quick, easy and a nice meal for your family."
95743,57130,2004-11-01,5,"This is definitely a man pleaser.  I made this with just 1 lb of chuck steak/roast using 1 can of soup, 3/4 can of water and 3T of onion soup mix.  Worked beautifully and was a much appreciated comfort food.  Great recipe, kc."
126104,57130,2005-06-30,5,"I'm not sure I've reviewed this or not, but I've used this once or twice per a recipe from the ladies I used to work for.  I had my serious doubts, but it's really delicious.  I usually put in more onions (chunks) and some carrots.  It's a keeper."
37868,57130,2005-12-08,5,I made this for my neighbors. This is the only way I can try out big recipes. I used 6 lbs Roast and had plenty for me and next door and some frozen for me for another day. This is really good. Thank You...I will make this over and over. Have a wonderful day. Hugs 2 U
8688,57130,2006-02-09,5,"I have now discovered my new favorite crockpot pot roast!  The flavor of this roast is perfect.  Not too salty and not too bland ~ just right!  This makes the perfect gravy and you will not have to do a thing to it to serve.  I served this roast with mashed potatoes, peas, applesauce and crusty Italian rolls.  A perfectly comforting and very easy to prepare meal!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe which will be enjoyed in my house for a long while to come : )"
60260,57130,2006-03-13,5,"This is how I grew up eating pot roast.  The only difference is I use one package of onion soup and 1 can cream of mushroom soup mixed and no water. (This amount is perfect for a smaller roast.) The juices from the meat are always enough to make a nice gravy.  I'm going to have to make this soon - it's a good one, you won't be dissappointed."
104295,57130,2006-07-04,5,"I made this up, at shapeweaver's suggestion, to take to some neighbors who are expecting a baby.  (I'm trying to stock their freezer a bit.)  I snuck a taste when I sliced it and packed it for freezing.  My roast was small (about 2.5 pounds) so I used 1 can soup, 5/8 cup water, and 1/2 pack of onion soup mix.  Great recipe.  Thanks."
173579,57130,2006-07-09,5,"Absolutely the best pot roast that my family has ever eaten.  So tender and moist.  The gravy was great also.  Will be making this many more times, I'm sure.  Thanks for posting such a fabulous recipe."
98919,57130,2006-10-22,5,I also have made my roasts like this for many years....always turns out perfect.  I also will use steak instead of a roast sometimes. Thanks for sharing!
149363,57130,2006-10-25,5,"Wow!!! So simple and so delicious!
I had a crappy cut of beef roast in my freezer that I really did not know what to do with. I had purchased two of these roasts, made one about 3 months ago with my regular recipe and it was sooooo terrible. Tough and nasty. So here I was left with one more roast, and NO WAY did I want to even eat it LOL, but I couldn't bring myself to throw it out!
So I gave this recipe a go, and guess what? The most beautiful piece of meat was the end result! I was so pleased!
Tender, and so flavourful, this recipe will save even the worst roast, I can't imagine how tasty a good cut of beef would be!
Thanks for a terrific recipe that I will always use in my slow-cooker!"
51011,57130,2006-11-11,5,"We really enjoyed this dish!  I made this oamc by freezing the roast w/ the water and onion soup mix during one of my sessions.  I then added the cream of mushroom soup to the defrosted roast in my crockpot. Only problem was that the soup didn't mix in well- but it did not affect the taste, just the look.  Dh ate so much that there were not any leftovers!  Thanks again for sharing!"
191533,57130,2007-07-18,5,Super! I added 3-4 carrots and 3 potatoes; used a 3 1/2 lb. roast- was done in 7 hours on low.
187373,57130,2007-08-20,4,"Good recipe...my DH really liked it. It was moist, tender after having been in the crockpot for about 8 or 9 hours on low. DH added the potatoes, carrots and onions during the last 5 hours of cooking, but the didn't get a lot of the taste."
355637,57130,2007-09-14,5,"Yummm! I have actually made this recipe off of the allrecipes site, but didn't realize it was the same until I read the description. Either way, it is good! This is my husbands favorite meal, and he really liked it because he prepared it this morning! After it cooked for about 6 hours, I came home and stuck some potatoes and carrots in there... a few hours later it was falling apart and the veggies were done. Yum!"
285039,57130,2007-11-14,5,"This was one of the best ""homestyle"" pot roasts I have ever made.  I used a 2 pound roast and added a couple handful of baby carrots and a tablespoon of garlic.  Other than that I followed the recipe as listed.  My husband noticed that this was not my normal recipe, stating that it seemed richer in flavor.  Definitely a keeper."
185285,57130,2007-12-14,5,"There are lists and lists of pot roast recipes and this one gives you the perfect 'comfort food' version. Nothing fancy - just downright perfection. I used Fat Free Cream of Mushroom and Eye of Round.  Fantastic, Thanks."
64642,57130,2008-01-12,5,Yummy and delicious.  The PERFECT easy entree recipe to use in our camper.
316717,57130,2008-01-22,5,i ended up using cream of mushroom and cream of chicken since that's all i had in hand. i also used beef broth instead of water. added baby carrots on the bottom. wasn't salty at all. in fact my dh added a little more seasonings to his plate. very good recipe and so easy. maybe it's my crockpot but it took me 12 hours on slow to get my roast tender. luckily i put it in really early.
37036,57130,2008-02-07,4,"This roast was really good!  I used a 3 pound roast, so I only used one can of soup.  I used the full amount of dry onion soup mix and water.  The roast had a great flavor and was very tender.  Thank you kcdelong for posting!"
226863,57130,2008-09-13,5,"I found this recipe on allrecipes as well, and then found it in a ""Fix it and Forget It"" Cookbook.  It is a great pot roast.  I love it, and we all enjoy it every time I make it!  Thanks for posting!"
88099,57130,2008-03-16,5,This was just awesome.  My roast was so tender and juicy.  My mom used to make roast like this all the time.  The only changes I made was that I browned the roast really well before adding to my pot.  I used my LeCreuset dutch oven to cook it in instead of the crockpot.  Set the oven to 300 and baked it for 4 hours.  Added some potatoes and carrots after 1 hour of cooking.  Perfect for us.  Thanks
774665,57130,2008-03-16,5,"This was wonderful and so easy! I made it a day ahead and then put it outside overnight (it was snowing) and then warmed it up in time for dinner. The gravy it made was perfect and I didn't have to add a thing. The only thing I'd change for next time is I'll add a little wine in place of the water, but it really was nice without it. The meat fell apart."
286851,57130,2008-09-13,4,Good and simple to make. Roast was fall-apart tender at the end of 9 hrs. Thanks for sharing.
140132,57130,2009-08-06,5,"Great pot roast.   I made this last night for my family and it was tender and fall off the bone good.  I added some carrots for the last hour and boiled some potatoes on the stove.  I felt I needed to thicken the gravy a bit more so I poured into a saucepan and add a slurry....worked like a charm.  Very good flavor and so simple.  I will make again, I am about to sit down to a sandwich made with leftover roast, which btw....sliced very nice the next day.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us."
808027,57130,2010-04-30,5,"I use golden mushroom instead of cream of mushroom...have been making this for years and it's always a family favorite.  Makes wonderful gravy!  I throw the potatoes and carrots in at the beginning, with the roast, and it is perfectly done and all in the crock pot.  Can't beat this for simplicity and taste!"
175824,57130,2010-05-07,5,"This was delicious. I used Epi Curious advice and used the golden mushroom soup. I can't believe the difference in taste between the cream of mushroom and the golden soup. I had never used the golden mushroom soup and it was totally awesome.  I also put the carrots and potatoes in when I put in the beef. I cooked it on low for about 8 hours. I added potatoes, onions and carrots when I added the beef roast.The potatoes, onions and carrots came out to a beautiful golden color and the meat was very tender. The vegetables were infused with the wonderful flavor of the gravy. Thanks for sharing."
50969,57130,2010-10-08,5,"The first time that I made this was in June of 2005,( WOW !!! Was it really that long ago ;) ? ) and it was very good. But now five years later it's like a fine wine, it "" Just gets better as time goes by "". A simple recipe, that is a "" Classic Comfort Food "" Thank you so much for posting this, and "" Keep Smiling :) """
369715,57130,2010-11-03,4,This is good and very easy to make. I did omit the water since others stated the gravy was watery. We all enjoyed this.
55578,57130,2011-09-24,5,"Great!  I used a smaller roast so used 1 can of 98% ff soup and 1/2 pkg of soup mix.  I added carrots, potatoes and leeks as well."
400708,57130,2013-10-25,5,"This is so easy and sooooo good.  I looked for the golden mushroom soup but couldn&#039;t find it so just used the regular as the recipe stated and it was perfect.  The house smelled so good when my DGSs returned from school that the first thing they asked was &quot;when&#039;s dinner&quot; that&#039;s unusual for them.  I cut up potatoes, carrots, celery and onions and put on the bottom, browned the roast before putting in the pot and then let it go - the gravy, veggies and roast were done and ready at one time and tasted great.  This is my go to recipe from now on, so easy even the kids can make it themselves.  I have a photo but an issue with the site won&#039;t let me upload so will come back and do that once it&#039;s fixed."
37779,57130,2014-09-19,5,"This version of slow cooker pot roast is the first I ever made way back in the day. Still good all these years later. Tender, well-seasoned, and the gravy is drinkable. Simply perfect. Thanks."
40961,82925,2006-03-12,5,"I just took this out of the oven. I've made it many times. It's easy and delicious and it makes your house smell wonderful.  It's great alone but even better with ice cream on top, thanks for sharing."
49304,82925,2006-04-08,5,"OH So YUMMY! This is the best apple crisp. I made it using brown-sugar-Splenda, worked GREAT. Served it to guest, with Breyers  sugar-free vanilla ice cream everyone devoured. Thank you Steve, for posting this yummy recipe that I will be making often!"
8688,82925,2006-10-06,5,"I had two Granny Smith Apples to use so I thought I would try this recipe.  I am so glad I did because it not only is simple, but wonderful.  I used a loaf pan and sprinkled with the dry topping mix, then dropped butter slices directly onto the topping.  It worked wonderfully.  Very nice apple crumble.  Thanks, Steve!"
456858,82925,2012-10-22,5,"Just perfect!  So easy, and so delish!"
394077,82925,2007-07-15,4,Very quick easy recipe and tastes great with icecream.  The only thing I would do different the next time is peel the apples and double up on the topping because it wasn't enough to cover my pan.
195589,82925,2007-09-13,5,"Yummmm!! I used the trick that another reviewer suggested and grated the frozen butter into the crumble, it incorporates really well that way. Thanks for a keeper!"
135887,82925,2007-10-21,2,"This was just okay for us.  I prefer the recipes where you put sugar, lemon juice, etc. over the apples before adding the topping."
199792,82925,2007-10-23,5,"This is a perfect apple crisp. It is quite sweet, just the way we like it. I am not a nutmeg fan so I just increased the cinnamon. I did take note of some of the reviewers and increased the topping by half. Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe."
324621,82925,2007-10-24,5,I too have always used this recipe which I found in my Betty Crocker cookbook. I've made it often for guests and it's a hit every time! Absolutely delicious!
185285,82925,2007-12-06,5,"I'm typically a ""more spice = better taste"" kinda gal, but this recipe proves that is not always the case. This crisp, has a way of schmoozing even the most 'refined' of tastes with its beautiful, rounded, yet comfortable taste. This is everything and Apple Crisp should be, and nothing it shouldn't. Thanks!"
140132,82925,2008-01-17,5,Delicious.  This is the perfect apple crisp.  The fruit held its shape wonderfully and the taste was delicious.  We served this was vanilla ice cream on top to let the ice cream melt down on the warm crisp...mmmmmm.  I will make this regularly since this make the perfect amount with just a little left over for me the next day...LOL.  Thank you for this wonderful dessert....Stephanie
97579,82925,2008-02-07,5,I just took this out of the oven and it smells and tastes wonderful! I love that it is simple ingredients we all have on hand. I used Ida Apples as that was all I had.  Thanks!
251626,82925,2008-06-16,5,Absolutely loved it. Thanks!!!
173579,82925,2008-08-03,5,This turned out so moist and delicious.  My DS just raved over it.  Thanks for sharing.
250031,82925,2008-09-19,5,Wonderful and easy! I mixed the topping ingredients in my food processor to make it super easy. I also made a warm vanilla sauce to go with it. Oh my!!
632249,82925,2008-10-07,4,This was a pretty good crumble.  I switched the nutmeg to allspice as I don't really care too much for nutmeg.  I made 1 1/2 times the topping as others said it was not enough but then I thought it was too much topping so I would just prepare it as written next time. Thx  1Steve.
353131,82925,2008-10-15,5,I picked about a bushel of apples from our tree this year and have been finding recipes from zaar to use them. This was a great recipe for apple crisp. Easy to make too. DD's helped make it and they loved it. DS wasn't as wild about it but he thought it was okay. DH also loved  it. I will be fixing this again this week!! Great dessert.
666723,82925,2008-12-08,5,"Wow wow wow!!!  I also doubled this recipe and put it in a 9x13pan.  At first it seemed like too much ""crisp"" but in the end it was great.  I did have to grate some frozen butter on top of the whole dish midway through cooking though because the crumble was dry and the butter did not distribute evenly.  I sprinkled some cinnamon on top of the apples before putting the crisp on as well.  I thought it was really good warm out of the oven, but it was ten times better cold out of the fridge the next day.  Delicious and easy."
242484,82925,2009-01-01,5,Terrific in every way...really hit the spot!
768828,82925,2009-03-21,5,"Another review is probably not necessary, but just had to write.  I normally don't care for apple crisp, but loved this one.  I have an apple tree and will be making this lots.  It is so easy and good.  I made exactly as stated, except used some sliced apples I had in the freezer.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe."
98919,82925,2010-08-08,5,"Made the way my mother used to make.  I omitted the nutmeg and used 1/4 t. cloves (my own preference).  I also doubled and put into a 9x13"" pan.  Thanks for sharing!"
91392,82925,2009-10-26,5,Great topping for any kind of fruit.  I had nothing but canned pears and peaches in the house and used it on that and it was fantastic.
402559,82925,2009-10-26,5,"Quick, easy and REALLY good. Thanks! I will be making this often."
59163,82925,2010-03-27,5,"I was printing this recipe out, and realized that I never reviewed it.  I've made it several times  (not that it needs another great review), but it's quick, simple and very tasty. Although it's great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, doesn't really need it, delicious all on it's own."
368078,82925,2010-05-12,5,"Yummy, yummy!  What I love most about this recipe is that it's so easy to make for the 2 of us.  We halved the crumble recipe, and sliced 2 apples, baking in individual dishes.  We served them with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream.  We also think it would be good with a little caramel drizzled on top."
1506604,82925,2010-08-03,5,"RIDICULOUSLY Easy!!! It is was easy to follow, so easy to make, and it went down easily.. Tasted great, just like the chain restaurants and the little cafes.."
879716,82925,2010-08-16,0,Very yummy!  I halved the recipe and would have like to have more apples and less crumble.  Next time I'll use 4 apples and half the crumble.  Thanks for such a simple and delicious dessert!  UPDATE:  I made this for friends using 5 apples and slightly less nutmeg than called for and we devoured it with vanilla ice cream.  So Good!
100526,82925,2010-09-21,0,"Delicious! I only changed one thing about the recipe, I used a pinch or so of all spice since I cannot eat nutmeg, and was fantastic! The recipe was easy and since I doubled it, there are plenty of yummy leftovers!"
60260,82925,2011-01-08,4,Quick and easy.  I liked that it wasn't too sweet and there was lots of great apple taste.  Will make again.
128473,82925,2011-11-21,5,"Thank you so much for sharing this easy to make dish 1Steve....delicious, absolutely delicious....I don't usually eat crisps, but your recipe has changed all that...my friend and I ate most of the crisp so I  had to make another for my dh....he loved it also.  Updated:  Six years, later and this is still my favorite apple crisp on the site. My dh would eat the whole dish by himself, if I let him. It is such a comforting dish, the spices are perfect in it."
333017,82925,2012-04-21,5,The only thing I did different was add some lemon juice to the apples.  Delish!!!
839492,82925,2012-04-26,2,"I made the recipe as directed, I found that overall, the dish was too dry. I baked longer to try to soften the apples and still was too dry, had to serve with milk on top. The only thing different I did was use Gala apples? I thought the flavor was good, but definitely needs something to moisten it up."
54678,82925,2012-09-30,5,We used apples from our tree whatever they are - they look like a granny smith.!! I could have eaten this raw but it had to cook and go to the dessert table at a charity supper so I will have to make it again for our own meal.
203325,82925,2012-10-13,3,"The flavor was good, but the apples turned to mush, almost like applesauce.  Could have been my apples?  I used Granny Smith."
489552,82925,2013-10-04,5,Delicious.
400708,82925,2013-10-21,5,"Made this exactly as  posted including the English custard on top, very good - this is the first time I&#039;ve ever &quot;made&quot; a crumble but not the first I&#039;ve ever &quot;eaten&quot; one and with all the apples from the orchard decided it was time to make my own.  This was so good with the flavor of the tart apples and the crunchy topping, YUM; the only thing I had a problem with and I&#039;m pretty sure it was me - is that parts of the topping was still dry, thinking I should have added more butter to it or something.  But the flavors, oh my!!  Used recipe#483829 for the cream which was a new experience (in a good way) for me - thinking it&#039;d also be so good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream"
280166,82925,2014-01-12,5,Very very easy and very yummy! Honeycrisp apples and homemade sweetened whipped cream pushed it over the top.  Thanks for posting!
620763,82925,2015-02-22,4,A great Apple crisp! I used a total of 5 apples. We loved this warm with vanilla ice cream.
35526,46922,2003-04-20,5,"Rather than the dried out smoked to death ham we usually have I decided to make this recipe.  It was wonderful.  The coating was not a paste....more like a sauce.  I was afraid it would not be on the ham long enough to flavor it.  The cooking time seemed a little long for the small, bone in ham I had so I cooked 3 hours and let it rest 1 hour.  Super ham, super sauce, super sandwiches from left overs.  Very moist and good, thanks."
128473,46922,2004-03-28,5,"Wow...this was so good. My family ate the whole ham, in sandwiches in one sitting. Thank you Boopster very much. We will definitely have this again and again and again."
52125,46922,2005-03-29,5,"This is the best ham I think I ever made. It tasted wonderful and was tender as can be. I have always used a brown sugar/mustard glaze on my hams but never completly wrapped and sealed them in foil, and I think that made the world of difference, because it was so tender.
Thanks Boopster....
"
29014,46922,2005-12-12,5,This was rave-a-licious!!  I made a half ham and used a Reynold's baking bag (because I had one!) and it was fabulous.  DH loved the gravy.  So simple & delicious - thanks for posting!
222433,46922,2006-04-17,5,"We enjoyed this for our Easter ham! Thanks for such an easy recipe. Make sure you wrap it tightly in foil because a lot of my ""sauce"" came out. It was still wonderful though. Very moist!"
229850,46922,2006-05-22,5,"Loved this. I have been making hams for years, and really pretty happy with the standard brown sugar and pineapple. Boy I was a little hesitant in trying this because my DH hates mustard, I finally tried it and the family scarffed it. It was the most flavorful juicy ham without any basting or work, I will be making my hams like this from now on Thanx to you!"
147109,46922,2006-12-03,5,"I tried a version of this recipe for Thanksgiving (my Dad is allergic to Turkey).  I actually placed it in a crockpot, and placed half a can of orange juice concentrate at the bottom, then covered with the brown sugar, yellow mustard mix.  I basted a few times, and cooked on low for about 5 hours.  Yummy!!!!  Everyone raved, even my husband who generally is not a fan of ham!  Thanks!"
60989,46922,2006-12-04,5,"To quote my husband: ""it's hard to mess up ham, but it is difficult to make it better. And this is better!"" Wonderfully simply and tasty recipe. Thanks!"
137911,46922,2006-12-26,5,"This was truely the best ham I've ever made.  It was so moist and delicious.  I did start off using a renolds baking bag but that was a disaster - the glaze got onto the bag and was burning, making an awful smell, so I pulled it out of the oven, cut the bag off and did the foil methold you recommended for the last 2 hours.  Glad I did - it turned out perfect.  Everyone raved!!  Thanks for the only recipe I will use from now on.  Pam"
187281,46922,2006-12-28,5,Excellent and easy! This really made a wonderful ham.  The foil method worked great and I even managed not to peek until 4 hours passed.  After 4 hours my 10 lb ham still needed another 30 minutes to be completely done.  It may have just been my oven.  It turned out moist and delicious with great flavor.  The best ham we've ever made.  Thanks!
229524,46922,2007-01-01,5,Easy and great taste.  Fixed it with Scalloped Potatoes (26460). Made for a great Christmas dinner.
394077,46922,2007-03-15,4,My family loves this. Thank you.
461834,46922,2007-04-09,5,"This recipe is worthy of it's title.  IT IS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  The ham was so tender, it almost melted in your mouth.  The flavor was excellent, not too sweet.  This ham was better than any other ham I have had, including Honey Baked or Heavenly Ham.  I used a 6 lb semi boneless ham, so I cut the brown sugar and mustard in half.  I cooked the ham for 3 1/4 hours and let it rest for 1 1/2 hours.  This will be the only ham I make at home, and no need to spend $60 for a honey baked ham.  Thank you so much for the recipe Boopster!!"
58836,46922,2007-08-02,5,"Had company over last night for supper.  Had bought a ham and wanted something a little special.  (Always looking for the right taste, ha!)  I decided to try this recipe and I'm so glad I did.  It was very very good.  I had lots of complements and there wasn't much left even though we had veggies out of the garden, fried okra, corn on the cob and squash.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks and this will probably be my choice from now on."
140132,46922,2007-08-15,5,I love love love this ham.  The flavor you get from the mustard and brown sugar is outstanding.  Yummy. We just finished our ham and I'm already thinking of making another...lol.  I will be using this recipe this coming Thanksgiving so i can wow my family.  thank you for this awesome recipe.....Stephanie
124249,46922,2007-11-11,5,"After 59 ratings can't really add anything new. We liked this easy ham glaze.

Thanks Boopster.

Bullwinkle"
172369,46922,2007-11-30,5,"Ham was not one of my favorite things, so I was just making it to get it over with-- But this is the secret to great ham. I think it is the way it is wrapped and so tender, it just soaked up the lucious juice! Now I love ham. Thank you for this great recipe."
7108,46922,2008-01-03,5,"Excellent ham!  My mom actually is the one who prepared this on Xmas.  She used a 10 lb bone in ham (local grocery store brand though we do buy Cook's brand and I would recommend that, less salty) and used 1/2 lb of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of yellow mustard.  Baked it for 3 3/4 hours and let it sit for only 20 minutes prior to carving...it carved well.  We really enjoyed this and will make this again at Easter.  Thank you for posting!"
142464,46922,2008-01-08,5,"Made this recipe a few evenings ago for our supper.
Now, mind you, hubby is not a great lover of ham, but he ate this meal and actually commented that it was quite good.  In fact he looked forward to having the leftovers the next day!!!
It was absolutely delicious served with mashed potatoes, corn niblets, green beans and beets. Mmmm good.  My thanks to you Boopster for sharing such a treasure."
316717,46922,2008-03-23,5,halfed the recipe since i ended up buying only a 9 lb. fully cooked spiral cut ham. i just reheated it as directed in the directions which was 350 for 1 hr. turned out delicious!!! picky husband raved and raved and picky son who doesn't eat ham asked for 3rds. thanks for sharing!
142367,46922,2008-03-27,4,"Very good, but I think I am still looking for the perfect ham recipe. Everyone enjoyed it, but I didn't get the raving praise that most of the reviewers mention here.  This recipe is very easy and clean up is a breeze if you line your pan with foil.  This recipe works well with Scalloped Potatoes # 85629. Thanks for sharing."
768828,46922,2008-12-28,5,"You don't really need another review, but thought I would add my two cents.  I made this for Christmas dinner, exactly as stated.  My whole family loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe. This is the only way I will be making ham from now on."
482376,46922,2008-12-30,5,"This recipe made it into book#234156!WOW...WOW...WOW!!!!! I cannot say enough about how wonderful this ham recipe is. It is simply outstanding. By far, the best ham I have ever cooked. I used a 10 pound ham and used a cooking bag (following the package directions) instead of the foil. I cooked it for about 3 hours and it was done perfectly. I wondered how the combination of mustard (I used yellow) and brown sugar would be. It was FABULOUS!!! It imparts great flavor and is lovely to spoon over the sliced ham. This ham was so tender that it literally started to fall off the bone. FANTASTIC. Thank you!!"
666723,46922,2009-03-20,5,"I made a few changes but I did stick with the method of cooking which definitely made for an ultra juicy and moist ham.  I made more of a glaze out of pineapple juice, brown sugar, and yellow mustard.  I also put the pineapple slices all over the ham.

I thought I wrapped it up tight in foil but mine leaked but since mine had more juices it was not as bad to clean up the bottom of the pan.  I basted during the last hour (I had a 9lb and did it for 3.5 hours) and let it sit the ful 30 minutes.  It was delicious and got rave reviews.  Thank you!"
135887,46922,2009-04-12,5,"Made as directed using a 9 lb bone in ham.  I made the same amount of paste as called for.  Put a layer of aluminum foil on the bottom of my roasting pan and didn't have a problem with clean up.  This produced a tender, juicy, flavorful ham.  This is the only way to go!"
355637,46922,2009-05-24,4,"Great sauce, very tasty!"
81611,46922,2009-06-01,4,"I have made this several times, and while the sauce has a good flavor, my ham still turns out dry. For ease of prep and convenient ingredients, this can't be beat."
1179225,46922,2009-10-04,5,Delish!!!!...and easy.
400420,46922,2010-12-26,5,"I made this for the second time (can't believe I didn't review this last year!) for Christmas dinner and it was so amazing!  Last year I used a whole ham and got rave reviews.  This year I used a 12 lb half ham and my ""foody"" nephew told me it the best thing he'd ever eaten!  So easy to make and the results make you look like ""super chef"".  I cooked for about 3 hours and let it rest for another hour or so without uncovering.  I can tell you now that this will be the only way I'll be making ham from now on!  Thank you for posting!"
126440,46922,2011-01-09,5,Wonderful ham.  It was easy and had wonderful flavor.  DH loved it.  Served with Sweet Potato Souffle.
937635,46922,2011-05-02,5,"This truly makes an Awesome Baked Ham! Thanks so much for the super easy, budget friendly recipe!!! Will make again and again."
294000,46922,2011-12-14,5,"I'm going to risk sounding like an idiot. I bought a pre-cooked ham (without a bone) prior to finding this recipe. Looking at the cooking time I didn't think my ham would really work so I took it back. The grocery store didn't sell ""raw"" hams which is what I thought I was looking for. (I don't cook a lot of ham.) The butcher suggested a pre-cooked spiral sliced bone-in ham. It did have a longer cooking time on its directions although it was only about 2 hours (it was half a ham...not 15 pounds). I cooked it for 2-3 hours at 325 (ham directions said 300 and this recipe said 350 so I compromised). It was still cold in the middle. I bumped it back up to 350 for about another hour and that was better. The end result was fabulous. So, for anyone who really hasn't dealt much with hams... I'm guessing the pre-cooked, no bone ham would have been fine with a shorter cooking time. The spiral sliced bone-in ham was fantastic as I spread each slice with the sauce before going in the oven. Anyway, I will do this recipe again. The ham/sauce is wonderful. Thank you!"
251626,46922,2012-01-08,5,Excellent
203111,46922,2012-04-10,5,"Awesome is right!  This is fantastic and we're not exactly ham lovers.  Next time, though, I will use the wide foil or perhaps an oven bag, for I ended up with a huge mess in the bottom of my pan that took a day to clean up.  It's such a good  dish, though, it was well worth it!"
176615,46922,2012-04-24,5,Moist and very easy. Good basic ham. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
191533,46922,2012-05-26,5,"Yum! I recently learned from an Amish friend that the way to have delicious, super-soft ham is simply to roast for hours in the oven like this recipe! But it's too hot to have the oven on that long, so I did this in the crockpot on Low for 5 hours. (no foil) Delicious!"
185926,46922,2012-12-24,5,Easy & delicious. Everyone was gushing about this ham.  My friends & family want to have ham more often.  Thank you
2549237,46922,2012-12-25,3,This ham was ok.  I followed the recipe to a T and the ham turned out way to sweet.  I will not be using this recipe again.
236170,46922,2013-02-15,5,"In 7 1/2 years of marriage, this was my first time serving ham. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! It was quite a hit :) and now I'm already planning on making it again."
145352,46922,2013-03-31,5,Awesome! The ham was so moist! I baked mine in a roaster. Worked great and freed up the oven!
456858,46922,2014-01-11,5,Really good....will make again.
18391,50719,2009-04-05,5,"Excellent muffins. DH loved them, thanks!"
355637,74730,2008-09-15,5,Added a little extra Parmesan cheese... SO good! Hubby is in love.
808027,74730,2010-06-02,5,Perfect fries!  Thanks
91392,76491,2004-10-21,5,"Easy, fast, low fat and dirt cheap!  You gotta love an old fashioned, real cocoa taste pudding like this.  I put some grated coconut on top to jazz it up a little.  This is a great idea that everyoen should try for pennies for 4 servings.  Thanks a bunch!"
173314,76491,2005-01-27,5,"Very, very thick and creamy.  Everyone loved it.  I would use a 2 quart bowl next time as mine started to go over bowl and it was thick and ready in 4 minutes with my microwave.  Thanks alot."
176615,76491,2005-01-28,5,"Wonderful! I was looking for a quick dessert tonight and made this as directed except using 2% milk (I didn't have skim). It was thick after 4 minutes in the microwave. Very rich and chocolately. Really no more difficult than the stuff from the box but light years better and I would imagine cheaper as well. Thanks, Chris, for a super recipe!"
33159,76491,2005-02-05,5,"This pudding is so rich, smooth & fudgey, you'd never guess it was low fat!!  I love warm pudding & this method was much better than stirring the pot on the stove for 10 minutes!"
8688,76491,2005-02-07,5,"I have to admit, I am not one to actually cook with my microwave.  But this recipe is so simple, pudding so smooth, rich and chocolatey good, that there is no reason why I can't make this anytime I want! There's no reason not to have dessert ready all the time : ) I microwaved for the first 3 minutes, stirred and then microwaved an additional 4 with stirring in between, as suggested in the directions for the perfect consistancy. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us, Chris from Kansas!"
121185,76491,2005-02-08,5,Oh WOW!  This was FABULOUS!  My 11 yr old son made this without my help and it was not only SUPER easy for him - it was soooo yummy!  He plopped a bit of whipped cream on top and then added some shaved chocolate - This deserves more than 5 stars for sheer simplicity and taste!!
182624,76491,2005-02-16,5,"I am seriously blown away at how yummy this is!  I had a hankerin' for something sweet, and came across this easy sounding recipe.  It was so easy and so creamy good.  I doubled the recipe and it cooked up perfectly after six minutes (plus the original three).  I also used 2 c. whole milk and 2 c. skim...delish!!  "
27643,76491,2005-03-01,4,"Very good. Easy to make, and quick too. If you like intense chocolate flavor this is the one. Thanks Chris!"
184723,76491,2005-05-06,5,Used regular 2% milk... turned out wonderful!
174991,76491,2005-05-23,5,This is a great pudding.  Nice and thick.  I used Splenda in place of the sugar and made it on the stove top.  I put it in parfait glasses along with mandarin oranges and topped with whip topping.  No more store stuff for us.
169969,76491,2005-08-09,5,This was so easy and so good! I cannot believe i have never made pudding from scratch before. I used the microwave and followed your directions and it came out perfect! The three year old of the house was in HEAVEN! Thank you for such a great recipe!
203111,76491,2005-10-15,2,"I guess I march to a different drummer...gotta say, I wasn't too crazy about the strong chocolate taste and slightly grainy texture."
160974,76491,2005-10-31,5,"I used 2 percent milk and cooked on the stove. It took about five minutes to thicken. We had it for our Halloween dessert. I liked that it wasn't overly rich. Since it is made with ingredients that I always have on hand, I'll be making it often.

Roxygirl"
124249,76491,2005-11-13,5,"This pudding had a nice chocolate taste without being overly sweet. This was a lot easier to prepare than cooking it on the sotve and hoping it doesn't burn. Will make again.

Thanks Chris from Kansas.

Bullwinkle."
232480,76491,2005-11-20,5,"Yummy!  This was very good - mine took the initial 3 minutes on high, and then 3 more minutes on high until it was done.  I may cut down on the cornstarch just a bit because it was VERY thick - almost too much.  I would have loved to have put some almond extract in this (my favorite way to eat chocolate pudding) but dh doesn't like almond AT ALL, so I left it with just the vanilla.  Will definitely keep this and make it again and again."
13483,76491,2006-06-11,4,This was good and very easy to make.  Think I needed a bit more cornstarch but the taste was excellent.  Thanks Chris from Kansas
362983,76491,2006-11-01,5,Delicious! I cut it down to 1 serving so I could only put it in the microwave for a few seconds at a time or else it would've bubbled over and burned. (Keep a close eye on it when it's in there!!) The pudding really thickened up after I let it cool though. I ate it up before I even put it in the fridge because it was just too tasty to wait any longer! I'll definitely make this again.
280166,76491,2006-11-28,5,"Wonderful recipe!  Made as directed and wouldn't change a thing--EXCEPT the big mess it made in my microwave--next time I will use an extra large bowl, and check/stir often when cooking....."
400420,76491,2007-01-18,5,Wow!  This is almost as easy as instant pudding and way better!!  I'll definitely be making this again and passing the recipe on to friends!  I made it just as written but next time I may try some add-ins. Thank you for a quick and easy dessert!
383346,76491,2007-02-11,5,Delicious.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  It's easy to do.
39301,76491,2007-02-14,5,"So simple, so rich, so delicious.  Thank you very much for posting this wonderful and relatively guiltless recipe!"
8629,76491,2007-02-18,4,"I used the stovetop method, as I was concerned about the comments from the people who had problems with it overflowing in the microwave.  I used dutch-processed cocoa which I think next time I will use a regular cocoa. This pudding is more chocolaty-flavored than sweet."
51011,76491,2007-03-17,0,"I am not going to give any stars, because we didn't really care for this.  It tasted very bitter.  I believe it may have been my cocoa though, so I am going to try a different brand, and then re-review.  Thanks!"
137911,76491,2007-05-12,5,"Mmmmm, Chris, this is sooo easy and delicious!  I used my large pyrex bowl and got 4 nice big servings out of mine.  It was a treat!  I can see where this would work great in a pie shell for a chocolate pie.  Goodbye chocolate Jello pudding mix - don't need you anymore."
294000,76491,2007-05-23,5,"I can't believe I haven't rated this yet!  Found this recipe a long time ago and love it.  Honestly, it's just about as quick as instant and tastes sooo much better.  Thank goodness for a little guilt-free chocolate recipe.  Well, almost guilt-free."
104295,76491,2007-07-12,5,I'm number 96 and we loved this.  My husband was especially glad to see that there was a crust on the top (as I usually use the instant packages and they don't have one).  We found this ultra chocolatey and it was so easy to do.  Yum.
248023,76491,2007-08-29,5,"Simple and delicious. It has all the delectable chocolate taste without all the guilt! My BF and I were craving some pudding but were out of the boxed kind so I threw this together. It was so easy. I used a 4 c Pyrex cup to cook it in so the clean up was a cinch. Make sure you stir after every minute during the second stage of cooking to prevent overflow! Thanks!  Edited 08.29.07 : Just wanted to say I made this with 10 oz of soy milk and 6 oz of skim milk and it still turned out so delicious.  For all the reviewers who said the texture was off or that is was clumpy... make sure you use a whisk during the 2nd phase of cooking and to whisk the pudding after every minute to ensure that it is smooth and the ""crust"" does not harden on top.  I only have to cook my pudding another 4 minutes after the initial 3 minutes until the texture is just right... We love this as a light dessert with some homemade whipped cream a couple of times a week!!!"
373817,76491,2007-12-10,5,Really good!
100526,76491,2009-02-02,3,"This receipe was easy, but my family found the taste to be less than appealing. The pudding had lumps that could not be explained and it just lacked something."
140132,76491,2009-04-17,5,"This will curb any chocolate fix your having.  So yummy and easy and quick to prepare.  I will make this again and again and again, etc.  thank you so much for posting this super recipe."
185926,76491,2009-09-23,5,"Fast, easy, and good for you.  Thank you.  I used soymilk and it tasted great."
1179225,76491,2009-10-10,5,This turned out great! what an easy way to satisfy a sweet tooth. Thank you for posting.
265954,76491,2010-07-10,5,"Tweaked a bit by using whole milk instead of skim, and 3 Tbsp. flour instead of cornstarch.  Also made on the stove top, stirring constantly with a wire whisk for about 15 minutes.  Refrigerated for two hours.  Delicious.  I disagree with other reviewers that say this isn't sweet enough as is.  I would add slightly more vanilla, but only b/c vanilla makes everything better!!  Thanks for posting."
250031,76491,2010-07-16,0,So easy and so excellent! There is no need to make pudding from a mix ever again!  Thank you!
59163,76491,2011-08-16,5,"I chose to make it on the stovetop, took a little under 10 mins.  Constantly stirred it so no chance of scorching.  Loved the ease of this recipe and it's lowfat with delicious results.  Just made this for the 2nd time, it was a hit with my toddler grandson, with sprinkles on top."
789516,76491,2012-01-12,4,Very good.  I added 1 tbsp instant coffee which added a nice flavour.  I did find it to be a bit lumpy so I'll have to try sifting the ingredients before adding the milk.
1133190,76491,2012-03-19,5,Very good chocolate pudding! I make it stovetop over med heat.  We've been enjoying this quite often recently.
132764,76491,2012-12-26,5,"This was perfect. I made it on the stove top as many others did, and used a whisk. It does go from liquid to thick in an instant so watch it closely. Thanks for posting."
242484,76491,2014-01-29,5,Sooooo good &amp; it was ingredients I already had in my pantry!
42720,52488,2004-03-10,5,"I have made this recipe twice in the last two weeks because it is easy to prepare and my family loves it. The first time I used thigh meat and the second time I used breast meat.  Followed your recipe exactly.  I was very pleased with the light, crispy coating on the chicken pieces after the 1st stage frying.  These were delicious, as is. The sauce carmalized to perfection.  No doubt I will be making this often. "
95743,52488,2004-05-03,5,Add me to the list of this recipe's fans.  Absolutely wonderful.  Double the sauce and add some heat.
121185,52488,2004-05-22,5,Oh wow!  This was WONDERFUL!  Next time I will double/triple the sauce!  YUM!!!
92886,52488,2004-06-17,4,"very good.  It is much more simple than other recipes I have used.  I would increase the sauce a bit and I was wondering if I could add a little something to the coating batter to peak the flavor, I will give it some thought.  I will certainly be making this one again."
146047,52488,2004-09-15,5,I won't bore you with the delightful details...ditto all the other favorable things that have been said about this recipe.  I only had dark soy sauce and seasoned rice vinegar on hand-- next time I'll use regular soy and unseasoned rice vinegar as I think it'll be even better as written.  Skinless chicken breast worked beautifully-- just meant shorter cooking time at a nice high temp so it wouldn't dry out.  Lovely dish.
37036,52488,2004-09-28,4,"I made this with DH in mind because he likes General Tso's chicken and we both thought it was good.  I omitted the rice wine, because I didn't have any.  I'm not sure what a difference the rice wine  would have made to the recipe, but DH and I both felt something was missing.  Perhaps a little garlic?  I used 8 Tien Tsin chili peppers from Penzey's instead of 5.  I think the sauce definitely needs to be doubled or tripled next time around. Will make again and buy some rice wine for next time around. "
22015,52488,2004-10-13,5,"This was excellent.   I loved the way the sauce cooked up.   Even though I don't care for a lot of sauce on my food, I did double this for the others in the house.   I was glad that I did.  For me though, it would have been fine with the sauce as written.   "
47559,52488,2005-01-06,4,"I used chicken breast rather than thighs, and it was very tender.  The coating was nice and light, and not overbearing or greasy.   We loved the texture of the sauce, but could have used a bit more.  I will definitely make this again, but perhaps adding some crushed pepper, and some ginger and garlic to give it a bit more spice and flavor."
189475,52488,2005-01-23,5,"This was an excellent recipe. It was much easier than I had expected. I never cook, so I decided last week that I needed to finally learn and this was the first thing I ever really cooked, besides easy stuff like hamburger helper. It really tasted like the general tso's you'd get at the chinese restaurant. The only suggestion I have for anyone making it would be to make an extra bowl of sauce if you are serving it with rice. We ate rice with the chicken, but the recipe only makes enough sauce to cover the chicken. "
68460,52488,2005-02-23,5,Excellent.  I followed this to the letter and it turned out wonderfully.  My husband's favorite Chinese restaurant dish can now be made at home.  I served it with the suggested broccoli and rice.  We'll be having this again.  Thank you Mean Chef :)
184723,52488,2005-03-04,5,"Chad here, this is one of my favorite meals.  This was the best version of it I have ever had.  Very good."
46660,52488,2005-04-03,5,"I know this probably doesn't need another review, but this chicken was so fantastic there's no way I could not comment on it!  I tripled the recipe and froze half (after the first fry stage, sauce separately).  Boy am I glad I did as I can't wait to have it again!  I made everything as directed, except I added some crushed garlic to the sauce.  I only used 2 whole chiles because I didn't want to traumatize my 3-year-old.  But my husband and I doused ours with red pepper flakes.  I garnished it with chopped green onion.  This has got to be, hands down, the BEST chicken I have ever made or had!  Thank you, Mean Chef, for sharing the recipe!"
149363,52488,2005-04-11,5,"Oh man, was this GREAT!!
This is my new favourite dish. Easy to follow, well written recipe. I will be making this many, many more times!
Thanks Mean Chef!"
173314,52488,2005-04-25,5,"delicious!  Instead of the regular sauce, this time I used a sweet and sour sauce like the chinese restaurants serve (3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup water, 3 Tbsp. ketchup, 3 Tbsp. cornstarch, 2 Tbsp. rice wine, and 1 tsp soy sauce.  blend to low boil in pan about 8-9 minutes till gelatin like)  I do like general's sauce also but this sauce is a good and may even want to make both for the variety!"
93006,52488,2005-05-05,5,"Terrific!  (Really, what did you expect?)  Used boneless-skinless chicken breasts, partially frozen for easy cutting, and canola oil.  Served sauce separate from chicken (for picky children) and it got quite congealed but I consider that my problem due to my choice of how to serve.  Wonderful flavor, and easy to make!"
187281,52488,2005-05-11,4,"A very good recipe but it seemed a bit too salty.  My husband told me that certain brands of soy sauce are better for cooking than the one I used.  But, overall the flavor was very good.  I don't like salt so maybe I will use a light soy sauce the next time I make it.  "
35526,52488,2005-09-19,5,This is superior!  Be sure and have all your ingredients ready before starting!!  I added some green onion at the end and it really put it over the top.  I served with rice.  I will be making this often.  Great recipe.
37305,52488,2005-10-05,4,"This was very good and my family liked it.  For some reason the coating just wouldn't stay on the chicken, especially after adding it back to the pan.  The coating was actually thinner than I expected it to come out, so maybe that was why (maybe the size of my eggs?  I used large).  All in all, we liked it and I will definitely try it again, playing with the coating so it sticks better.  Thanks!"
60260,52488,2005-11-09,5,"Great recipe!  We tried this out for an Asian dinner party we hosted and everyone LOVED it - in fact my kids have been begging for it so we're having it again tonight.  When I did make it the 1st time I doubled the recipe and made 4X the sauce.  Everything worked perfectly but a note to others if you do double the meat, once you have done the initial frying process and move on to the 2nd stir frying - don't put all the meat in the pan at once - I would break it up a bit.  Once I put that much meat in my wok it was hard to get all the bites as crispy as I had wanted.  It's a perfect recipe and it will be made often!"
222055,52488,2005-11-14,5,This was fabulous! I can't believe I made it myself! Didn't find the rice vinegar so I did what another reviewer did and used cooking sherry. I will be on the lookout for the vinegar to make it the next time.
278113,52488,2006-02-11,5,"We had Chinese night last night in our home, and my family loved this!! We made it with both chicken and shrimp. Both were delish! (The shrimp cook QUICK, be careful!)
I did not have rice wine, so I subbed Sherry, and I cut back 1 Tbsp on the sugar also. It was fabulous! I also tripled the sauce so we had extra for the rice...YUMMAH!! Thanks for sharing..what a treat!"
222564,52488,2006-02-13,5,"Rave review number 120 for this recipe. Wow!
Absolutely divine flavor, easy, no fancy ingredients. I love sauces, so doubled it up. It still wasn't swimming in it, so might just triple it up next time, so good it was! "
52125,52488,2006-02-15,5,"Excellent to die for recipe! I used chicken breasts and sherry in place of the rice wine. I also had to use dried red pepper flakes, and doubled the sauce. It tasted really wonderful.
Thanks MEAN CHEF...."
169969,52488,2006-02-18,5,"Super recipe! So easy to put together! I used a combination of boneless thighs and breasts. The chicken does not need any extra sauce at all but, next time I will double the sauce so that there is some sauce for the broccoli. Wonderful recipe.... I knew 121 Reviewers couldn't be wrong! So here is another 5 star review for #122!"
280271,52488,2006-02-26,5,This is Great! Easy to prepare and had just the right flavor for general tso's chicken. I did triple the sauce to make sure I had enough for the rice. It was also great next day for leftover's at work.
53932,52488,2006-03-05,5,This was just wonderful!  Better than the General Tso's at most Chinese restaurants.  I made the recipe just as written and it was perfect.
222433,52488,2006-03-11,5,"Mean Chef...You made me the queen of the kitchen with this recipe! My family proclaimed that this is the best recipe I have EVER made! WOW! We love chinese! I liked this recipe because the breading was very light and the sauce tasted wonderful! I used a frying pan (because I need to purchase a new wok)It still worked great, but I think the wok would make it easier. This will be made many, many, many more times in the future!"
68960,52488,2006-09-24,4,"Great recipe, very tasty and easy to make. I really should have reviewed this years ago. Thanks for keeping this orginal Kirstin and thanks for posting Meanie."
347822,52488,2006-10-22,4,"Time consuming but pretty good dish.  The chili pods definately add a kick to the dish.  My one suggestion would be to add a couple veggies such as green onions, broccoli and carrots.  I served it with a basmati recipe.  Thanks for the posting."
377581,52488,2007-01-02,5,"Yummy recipe! I love the sauce. This was very easy to make. I mixed everything up before starting to cook. Then just dipped and fried. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the sauce. Excellent! I'm definitely making this again.
Thank you so much for sharing."
140132,52488,2007-01-31,5,This is so very good.  I wasn't sure about the cornstarch breading but it was fantastic.  I made this with #38748 Chinese Fried Rice and it was a very satisfying meal for us.  Thank you for this great recipe......Stephanie
248023,52488,2007-04-24,4,"My BF loves General Tso's chicken and orders it every time we order out Chinese.  I had never thought about trying to make it...but I am glad I did.  It was so much easier than I thought it was going to be and the taste was right on the money...according to him.  I did cook the sauce a little too long at the end when it was carmelizing, so make sure you watch it carefully because it really does only take 1-2 minutes TOPS.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!"
255338,52488,2007-06-03,5,"It is an abomination that I waited this long before trying this out, hence depriving my kids with a sensational dish that they absolutely enjoyed. Followed the recipe faithfully, but I used chicken breasts instead. Thank you so much for sharing."
482376,52488,2007-06-09,5,"Outstanding!! I'd rate this higher if I could. It tasted exactly like General Tso's chicken at a Chinese restaurant. The sauce amount was perfect for us. I wouldn't change a thing. I recommend prepping everything before you set out to cook (make the sauce, mix the cornstarch & beaten eggs, cube the chicken, start the rice, etc...). I searched high and low for rice wine and finally found it at Kroger. I think this would be a great entertaining dish along with egg rolls, rice, steamed veggies, almond & fortune cookies! I'm anxious to try making it up through the stage 1 frying, refigerate & when guests come, do the second stage frying.
Delish recipe...MUST TRY!"
125640,52488,2007-07-16,5,"The first couple times I made this, I made it exactly as directed it was really good, but not quite as good as our favorite Chinese place. This time I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the sauce and it made all the difference; it was just right. I serve it with fried rice; they go very nicely together. Thanks."
187373,52488,2007-10-04,4,"Good recipe! Used chicken breast and didn't have dried chili pods, so just used pepper flakes as another reviewer did.  Worked fine. I didn't add all the oil, just a little in the bottom of the pan.  Mine didn't turn out as pretty as Shasha's picture, but it tasted delicious! Thanks for adopting Mean's great recipe!"
285039,52488,2007-11-07,5,"General Tso's is one of my DH favorites, so I thought I would give this a try.  His response; ""this is the best General Tso's I have ever eaten!""
I substituted chicken breast for the thighs, used about 4 t. of szechwan chili sauce (my store does not carry dried chili pods), used Splenda and used Marsala instead of the rice wine. I felt it was okay for me to rate still since the substitutions are close the original and the integrity of the dish was not lost.  Definitely a keeper!"
28649,52488,2007-11-17,5,My daughter made this for dinner and their were no leftovers.  While it's time consuming it is worth it.  We ended up using extra rice vinegar since we had no rice wine and we used red pepper flakes for the dried chili pods(the girls don't like really hot food).
532289,52488,2007-11-26,5,Double or tripe the sauce. Otherwise don't change a thing.
499050,52488,2007-12-19,4,Very Good!
74281,52488,2008-01-14,5,"I love the fact that the first stage of frying the chicken can be done in advance as that part can be a bit time consuming, but the dish is SOOO delicious that I'd like to make it often. After the sauce is made and first stage frying is done, it is really easy to throw this recipe together for a quick weeknight meal that everyone will love! I did 1.5 X the chicken (used boneless, skinless thighs) but tripled the sauce and there was not too much sauce. Thanks for the nice detailed instructions Kristin as it made my first try at Chinese so simple! I will be making this often."
218535,52488,2008-03-17,4,Takes time but very good. I'd double the sauce next time.
316717,52488,2008-08-07,5,"although this doesn't taste exactly like the general tso's i'v tried...it was really good! i doubled the sauce which i regretted because it almost tasted a little salty. and my kids mentioned they didn't want extra sauce on their chicken. so next time i'll listen to the chef's direction and not double. my husband enjoyed this so much that he emailed me while at work to say how ""really good"" the lunch was. he never does that plus he's so darn picky! so i'll put this in his favorites file. next time tho i'll add a little more sugar or brown sugar to make it a little sweeter since that's what i'm used to. thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe!"
126440,52488,2008-12-17,5,This was a great recipe.  I used chicken breast but was delicious!  Served with Perfect rice  Recipe # 53520 and  Oven Roasted broccoli Recipe # 206184.  Great Meal!
969481,52488,2009-01-24,5,"Great recipe! I made this and served with white rice and ""Broccoli Parmesan"" #17402. No need to go to the buffet anymore!"
1269015,52488,2010-11-29,4,"I used tofu instead of chicken and subbed 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper for the chilis. The cornstarch didn't stick too well to the tofu, but it still came out a nice golden brown. Very strong tofu taste though, I should have marinaded it in the sauce first. The sauce was great, even if the rest of my dish wasn't."
359220,52488,2011-10-08,5,"Oh yum!  I've been waiting for the right time to try this dish and last night seemed perfect.  I was wanting chinese food, but something tastier and fresher than the dismal takeout we'd had recently.  I used chicken tenders which I cut into large pieces.  I wasn't very impressed with the batter (not crispy at all, even after the 2nd stirfry) but it didn't detract from the overall taste.  I didn't have any chili pods, so I used a couple squirts of sriacha sauce.  I was surprised how quickly and how perfectly the sauce became a glaze!  Just like we get at our favorite restaurants.  Yum, yum, yum!"
226863,52488,2013-07-17,5,"This is definitely a good General Tso&#039;s recipe....not the best I&#039;ve found but very good.  I halved the amount of chicken but left the sauce amount alone.  I wanted some sauce for my steamed broccoli. I also increased the pepper to chicken amount, but I like things spicy.  Served over jasmine rice, and this was a very good dinner!! Thanks for sharing your adopted recipe."
1072593,69214,2011-01-21,5,You owe me a new laptop.  I've gone and drooled all over the place.
789516,69214,2012-03-22,5,I made the topping for this burger and it was fantastic1
13483,69214,2004-07-06,5,I'm not a big burger fan but these were good.  I left out the mushrooms as I did not have any on hand.  The bacon gave this a real nice flavour.  I upped the hot sauce a bit too.  Good for a summertime BBQ.  Thanks Just Cher.
22015,69214,2004-08-03,5,I agree with the others - these are wonderful.  I have to admit I was a bit sceptical over the mayo but it works nicely.  Thanks - this is definitely a keeper!
52543,69214,2004-08-05,5,"Delicious burgers with a perfect spice blend! Other than scaling the recipe in half to serve 3 people & using fresh mushrooms (which I sauteed before mixing), I followed the recipe verbatim. Thanx Cher!"
26512,69214,2004-08-07,5,"These burger rock, Cher! I sauteed fresh mushrooms and I added green onion to the mayo mix, other than that, I didn't change a thing and they were just outstanding. Very much like something you would find in an upscale bistro. We really enjoyed these, the flavors just worked perfectly with the smoky flavors from grilling the burgers. We will have these often - thanks for posting!"
76951,69214,2004-08-28,5,"Just Cher, these are just wonderful!!  Reminds me of a recipe I have (Chipotle-Honey BBQ Bacon Burger with Gorgonzola Cheese recipe #60828) but not as much work.  The only thing I did differently, was substitute fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder.  This is going into my permanent recipe file.  I'll be making this over and over again.  Thanks for posting!"
29782,69214,2005-03-07,5,"Marvelous recipe!!!

Cher these were the best hamburgers DH and I have ever had. The cheese mixture is awesome on the burgers.I made the cheese mixture ahead of time and put in ref. to chill at least a hour  before we started the grill. I did add a dash of Hickory Smoke Liquid to the mixture.
I would rate this a higher rating if I could.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe. "
56087,69214,2005-03-20,5,"I cannot believe I never reivewed this SUPERB recipe.  I tried them on a whim last summer and hubby and I loved the result.  In looking for the recipe this weekend to make again, realized I never reviewed it.  If you want an easy, delicious different twist on your burgers, this is a MUST try recipe.  Thanks Cher for a yummy recipe."
68884,69214,2005-08-06,4,"Really good. I followed the recipe exactly - using a light mayo - and hubby & I both enjoyed the topping for a casual weekend dinner. I only wish the burgers had a bit more spice to them -- or maybe I just needed to add more topping? I usually add more spices to the meat mixture when making burgers, and I'll do that in the future but definitely make this topping again & again."
37779,69214,2006-06-02,5,"These burgers were so delicious, Cher. My husband and I thought they were moist and tender and they were seasoned just right. I had never tried a topping such as this one on a burger before (we usually just slap a slice of cheese on top). It was very good--loved the cheddar-y bacon flavor. Thanks for sharing your recipe; it made for a fun and memorable burger night. "
136997,69214,2006-07-24,5,This was a very tasty burger! My husband mentioned twice how much he liked it. Nice change from the regular burger. :)
52125,69214,2006-12-05,5,This burger got rave reviews from my family! Thanks a bunch Just Cher....
53932,69214,2007-04-30,5,Great burgers.  All the toppings were so good together and the burgers were perfectly seasoned.
240552,69214,2007-05-22,5,This was awesome!  I didn't use mushrooms for personal preference.  I made them in a frying pan this time.  :)  Thank you so much for sharing!!
368078,69214,2007-06-12,5,These burgers were SO good.  We thought they were even better than what you could get in a restaurant.  This recipe is one we will make again!  Thanks :)
358796,69214,2007-07-14,5,Awesome flavors! The ooey gooey cheese topping made it look so yummy. Very good burgers!
140132,69214,2007-12-12,5,"Mmmm-mmmm.  I have made these twice now and they are really good.  I love the topping.  We served these with curly fries and onion rings, thank you for a great meal.....Stephanie"
178742,69214,2008-02-05,5,"OMG! Guess what? These were a winner! We loved the ""special sauce"" You know what though, after I finished my burger, I remembered I forgot the onion. If you are like us, you NEED the onlon. We love onions.. But obviously we ate it and loved it without the onion too!!

Thanks for sharing!!"
95743,69214,2008-05-29,5,"Man, are these rich and good.  We used ground turkey and fresh portabellos, whole grain ciabattas AND Dh made them all by himself.  Not a big deal in some households but this isn't some households.  GREAT burgers."
355637,69214,2008-07-06,4,Good stuff - I like spice with my burger! thanks!
218535,69214,2008-08-18,4,very good burgers.
198154,69214,2009-02-08,4,I used temph bacon instead of the real bacon. The vegetaians in our family had grilled veggie burgers with the topping while the meat eaters had the burgers from your recipe. We all enjoyed them and will probably make again when it warms up and we are looking for meals to grill. Thanks for a great recipe.
132383,69214,2009-03-22,5,My husband made these for us on Friday night and we had left overs yesterday.  These are some awesome burgers!  We love hamburgers and love trying new ways to have them.  We are thinking about making just the filling part and making some gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches with it.  Thanks so much!
499050,69214,2009-04-03,4,Very Good.
369715,69214,2010-03-31,4,These were good but we weren't WOWed by them. I followed the recipe other then I didn't use the mushrooms as hubby is the only one that likes them.
37636,28649,2002-05-19,5,"My husband and I enjoyed this quite a bit as we are both fans of Thai food! Of course, we had to up the heat a bit! But that's a matter of personal taste. This was a very fragrant dish, as you said, but was even more so after I added a sqeeze of lime just before serving, which enhanced the flavors of the chicken even more. I served this dish with stir-fried rice vermicelli noodles with assorted vegetables and lemongrass on the side, instead of the rice suggested. I used basicly the same combo of sauce that was used on the chicken to season the vermicelli. It all turned out very lovely, much nicer than something you could get at a restaurant, and very easy to make! Thanks! :)"
13796,28649,2002-06-10,5,I made this for an early lunch today. It was very good. I used 3 chopped jalapenos because I didn't have Thai peppers. I was a little skeptical after putting the fish sauce in because BOY DID THAT STUFF STINK! Not to worry though.. it tastes good. I made a double recipe so I would have some dinners or lunches already prepared. I served over a little rice along with fresh steamed snow peas. I sprinkled some freshly chopped basil over the dish before serving.
92886,28649,2007-06-21,4,"Yummy change of pace.  I wonder if adding the basil  closer to end of cooking might be a good idea.  The cooking time destroyed some of the flavor.  I used whole pieces of fresh chicken and pulsed them in the food processor a couple of times.  I got a laugh out of my husband's comment as he wolfed this down ""Is this meat chicken or fish?"""
188119,28649,2007-08-27,5,"This was pretty good, yum.. close to Larb too.  I used splenda and I don't think I noticed any difference in taste.  Thanks!"
142335,28649,2008-05-20,5,I used two jalapeÃ±os for my peppers and used the seeds. I used splenda brown sugar which made it a little on the sweet side but it balanced out the heat of my dish perfectly. Iâ€™ll make this again. Great for watching carbsâ€¦I wrapped mine in lettuce.
185926,28649,2012-11-19,5,"Excellent recipe, very forgiving.  I added a ton of other vegetables to make it a whole meal.  I will make this again."
60989,74730,2004-02-29,5,"We loved these. I didn't peel the potatoes, and used olive oil (since it isn't specified in the ingredients). I just through everything to to a sealable bag, shook them up, and put them on the pan. Ready in a snap! The 35 minute cooking time was right on. They came out slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I will absolutely be making these again. Thanks so much!"
95743,74730,2004-11-17,5,"These are perfectly seasoned, allowing the taste of the potato to shine.  I baked them on a parchment-covered baking stone following the recipe directions.  Only change I will make next time is to not peel the potatoes.  Thanks, Marie."
59473,74730,2004-11-28,5,These potatoes were excellent. I used olive oil to cook them. They turned out nice and crispy. Thanks for a great recipe.
176615,74730,2005-02-07,5,"Yum! A wonderful compliment to our burgers last night. I cut the potatoes into rather thin strips so they were nice and crispy. The coating really adhered nicely and uniformly and gave them a beautiful color. I thought they were perfect, the kids found them a bit spicy, I'll just cut the pepper back on theirs next time. Love them with avocado oil or olive oil. Thanks, Marie, for another keeper!"
173579,74730,2005-03-07,5,These have just the right amount of seasoning.  They were very crispy.  We all loved these.  Thanks for posting.
36944,74730,2005-03-17,5,"What a great tasting recipe that uses ingredients I always have and it can be put together in mere minutes.  I cooked mine for about 25 minutes, but I cut them thin and due to the hot oven they were nicely brown and crisp.  Marie, thankk you for a delicious recipe."
182624,74730,2005-05-17,5,"These are FANTASTIC!!  I was shocked that they were not only as good  as, but better than most fries that are fried in oil and grease - and that cost much more than just buying a couple of potatoes.  The flavor is great.  My husband said they look and taste like a restaurant's fries.  I served them with bbq pork sandwiches, and they were fantastic.  I did line my pan with foil to make cleanup easier, but that's the only thing I changed.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I think I'll make them again today for me for lunch!"
40961,74730,2005-06-19,5,I have made these several times over the last few weeks and have enjoyed many compliments and requests for the recipe. I want to thank you for posting this delicious and easy recipe and for making me look good!:)
92816,74730,2005-07-11,5,"Wow,I can see why this recipe has so many great reviews.These are delicious.Easy to make and very tasty."
103876,74730,2005-09-04,5,These fries were very tasty!  I really liked the seasonings.  Thanks for posting!
189616,74730,2005-09-17,5,"Delicious...As others recommended I left the skins on and used parchment paper. I always soak my potatoes prior, after doing that and drying them thoroughly w/paper towels-I placed them in a storage bag and added the spices directly to the bag, than added the oil, gave it a couple of shakes than placed them on the parchment paper. Will definately make these again
Thank You Marie-"
136997,74730,2005-12-05,5,Very tasty spuds. I doubled the recipe as there are 3 of us. :)
185285,74730,2006-01-24,5,"These were outstanding. I took careful time to cut the slices evenly so they would cook through at the same time, and it made a big difference.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
278113,74730,2006-04-26,5,"These are SO good, I kept going back for just ""one"" more! I used olive oil, and sprayed the foil lined pan with cooking spray...this is the first time EVER for me that my oven fries did not stick at all, and were crunchy! FABULOUS! Thanks for sharing, we will use this recipe again and again!"
347822,74730,2006-10-25,4,Awesome!
373817,74730,2007-01-08,5,"I have tried several oven fry recipes before, but this is definitely the best! I also made mine with sloppy joes!Great recipe!"
124190,74730,2007-01-26,5,These were great. I subbed chili powder for the paprika. The kids ate them like crazy. Thanks!
199792,74730,2007-02-16,5,Excellent! These are so much better than any fries you will ever buy. The spice is nice and the parmesan adds an amazing touch. I used olive oil. These will be made many times at our house. Thank you so much.
285039,74730,2007-07-11,5,"Very good flavor, they were completely devoured!  I will have to make them again, though because I put them on speed bake for 23 minutes and they over-cooked at bit.  Thanks for posting."
222564,74730,2007-03-19,4,"Tasty fries! I did not peel the potatoes either, we like the added texture of the peel. Fries turned out  little too oily and soft, I would cut oil down to 1/2 tbs next time and maybe up the cheese to 2 tbs."
180090,74730,2007-04-02,5,"These turned out wonderful! So far these are my favorite baked fries I've tried! Thanks for posting this, I'll be making them often because they are so easy and good!"
29782,74730,2007-04-22,5,Fabulous! I made this recipe up at the lake and everyone just raved on how good they were :)  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
51011,74730,2007-04-24,5,"Making fries in the oven has become a new Sunday tradition of mine... and I have been wanting to try this recipe.    I did use Yukon Golds instead of baking potatoes,and my oven cooks a bit hot- so I cooked mine at 425. Other than that, no changes.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
240552,74730,2007-06-02,5,SUperb! I used fresh parmesan cheese and also turned them 1/2 way through. They came out a little early about 10 minutes but my potatoes were small.
329638,74730,2007-07-15,5,"Delicious!  I coated the potato strips with olive oil, then layed out on the pan and sprinkled with the seasonings (I ommited the salt on this step and sprinkled it on the potatoes after they were baked).  Thanks for posting!"
358796,74730,2007-08-30,5,I used shredded parm and it melted nicely to give it a little crunch. Cooked at 400 for 30 minutes and they were perfectly done - not too crispy and not too soggy.
231054,74730,2007-10-02,5,"Marie -- Another great recipe.  I made these tonight and we thoroughly enjoyed them.  It was a bit of challenge -- I had two other things that I was baking in the oven -- so I had to do some juggling.  Even though these turned out so good -- I know if I hadn't had the other two dishes in the oven at the same time -- they would have even been better.  I did what others did -- put all the dry ingredients along with oil (I used olive oil) into a plastic bag, added the potatoes and coated them that way.  It was a breeze.  We'll be enjoying your potatoes a lot in the future.  Thanks for sharing."
55578,74730,2007-11-02,5,Easy and tasty!
666723,74730,2007-12-12,5,"These turned out super crispy, just the way I hoped they would! I cut mine a bit thinner and added red pepper flakes. I turned a couple of the bigger ones once, but they all turned out great and I'll definitely make them again."
55729,74730,2008-01-17,5,"I apologize for not having rated these. I make them all the time. They are easy and delicious. The only changes I often make are to leave the peels on, and to make extras!"
97579,74730,2008-02-06,5,"Very tasty! I accidentally cooked them to long which was a huge bummer because the ones that weren't baked to a crisp were really good! I think they should be flipped half way through, which I will do next time. I will definately make again!"
140132,74730,2008-02-21,5,"Yummmmy, these were so good.  I made them to go with burgers and my family and I loved them.  I sliced them very thin and they got very crispy with wonderful flavor.  Thank you for posting....Stephanie"
222970,74730,2008-03-04,5,"Just right! They were a little spicy but not too much.

My adaptions: I did four potatoes for two adults and four kids. I didn't peel the potatoes, I just cut off the ends and squared off the sides which removed a lot of the peel but not all. I also mixed the oil and spices in a plastic bag and tossed the potatoes around until they were all coated.

The only change I recommend is turning them about halfway through baking.

Otherwise, this is a good standard five-star recipe. Thanks!"
218535,74730,2008-04-14,5,I have tried several baked fries recipes on this website. This is by far the best.
126104,74730,2008-05-21,5,"These were very good. They were nice and crisp and have a lovely flavor. I might add a tiny bit more salt the next time, or some cayenne rather than black pepper, but absolutely a keeper. Thanks, Marie."
486718,74730,2008-08-09,5,"Wow, quick and easy and healthy,
what more could you ask for!  Thanks, I will be making this one often."
64203,74730,2008-08-21,5,"My husband kept saying... those are great potatoes, wow - I love those potatoes... and then he went to eat all of his and any that were left on the kids plates.
I eyeballed the ingredients... didn't measure, but put it all in a large ziploc bag, shook it, added the potatoes, shook it well, added the oil, shook it well and then baked. Delicious!"
470351,74730,2008-10-29,5,"THESE WERE EXCELLENT!!  I have to admit, I did make one major change....I had to use pecorino romano rather than parmesan when I realized the parmesan was empty after I'd already prepped this whole recipe.  Had fresh grated pecorino romano and quadrupled all the ingredients to feed us all and HOLY COW WERE THEY GREAT!!!!  The cooking time was spot on and the flavor was crazy good.  Thank you so much for this one!  A real winner!"
229524,74730,2009-02-02,5,These fries are FANTASTIC!!!!  Love that they are so EASY to make.  Made them twice in one week.  They are sooooo tasty and so much better for you then the frozen ones.  This is the only way we will be have fries in our house from now on.
4470,74730,2009-03-01,5,I make oven fries almost every Sat. night and these are right up there with the top choices.  I use no oil at all just the spices.  Thanks for posting Marie.
81611,74730,2009-03-05,4,"I made 2 separate batches. It is important to put the spices on before the oil. Nice combination of spices, but I didn't end up with the best texture. They seemed overcooked inside, while getting tough instead of crispy on the outside. Maybe it's my old, finicky oven that didn't have the right temp, who knows."
195589,74730,2009-05-23,5,"Man O Man...are these ever good! I soaked the strips for about 1/2 hour and dried very well with paper towels. I put the spices and potatoes in a zip lock bag and gave them a good shake. I like them on the thin side, so mine cooked in 30 minutes. Also, used parchment paper that I sprayed with Pam.  Oh, and I never peel my potatoes for any dish. I just LOVE these! This will be my go-to recipe for fries. Thanks so much for posting, Marie!"
532289,74730,2009-09-06,5,"What can I say, I found another Zaar 5 star recipe.  Made as directed, except I didn't peel mine.  Set the oven timer for 17 minutes because I was going to turn them.  I was glad I did because mine were cooked perfectly.  They were cut like shoestring fries. Next time (as soon as I'm done leaving the review) I am going to cut them a little thicker like steak fries.  These were very good and without all the fat and mess of deep frying and the oil slick taste of frozen.  Thanks for sharing such and easy and delicious recipe."
26512,74730,2009-09-08,4,"These were very good fries. I didn't peel the potatoes and cut them in wedges. Great with burgers, I really liked the coating and will make again. Thanks for the recipe."
121185,74730,2009-09-20,5,"These were super yummy!  Ours never really ""crisped"" up but they sure tasted good! :)"
47559,74730,2009-12-21,5,"One of the best oven baked fries I've tried. Yummy seasoning. Nice and crisp. Thanks, Marie."
242484,74730,2010-05-14,5,These were so yummy and couldn't be any easier...no reason to buy those unhealthy frozen fries anymore!
1506604,74730,2010-06-18,5,"Tasted really good. Perfect amount of seasoning, didn't even need ketchup. My only comment is that a little of my potatoes burn in the baking glass, next time I'll try baking it on parchment paper or decreasing the degrees a bit."
7108,74730,2010-09-04,5,"This was a hit tonight!  I peeled and cut taters, combined spices in a ziploc bag and added taters to shake.  Placed the taters on a pre-heated baking stone and drizzled the olive oil on top of the fries and baked for 30 minutes.  I thought the seasoning may be too much for my picky 10 y/o who hates ""spicy"" things but he liked the fries.  Served aside of a triple decker BLT club and dill pickle slice.  Thanks for posting!"
37449,74730,2011-04-25,5,"Yum. I halved the recipe, served with some ketchup, devoured them.Thanks! Made for the Healthy Choices game."
305531,74730,2011-09-26,5,Great potatoes. Loved the spices and they came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Thanks Marie for a nice keeper. Made for Healthy Choices Tag.
226863,74730,2011-12-12,4,"The seasonings are spot on!  I cut my potatoes like I'd normally cut fries, and for the time specified, it was too much.  I ended up with some potato chips!  But that being said, the flavor is great, and through trial and error, I'll find the right slice, temp, and time combo.  I used olive oil instead of regular oil.  Yum!"
928301,74730,2013-01-26,5,"I loved these!  I halved the parmesan.  I liked how they had flavor, but weren't totally cayenne fries.  I did the soak in ice water thing too & they ended up nice and crispy."
126440,74730,2013-01-30,4,Good and spicy.  Will cut thinner next time.
1179225,74730,2013-01-31,5,"Excellent, easy and looked great to boot! 'll be making these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
632249,74730,2013-10-24,5,"Great recipe, yummy fries!  I did cut the heat back to 425F due to other dishes I was cooking at the same time.  Everyone loved them. Thanks for the recipe!"
9869,80118,2004-09-06,5,"I used this to cover my sons chocolate birthday cake, I love the look of a dark cake with a light icing.
It has a lovely spreading consistency and tastes great, thanks for posting."
146047,80118,2005-01-24,5,"Kittencal, like your chocolate buttercream frosting, this frosting is top notch. It's very tasty and creamy. I even used real whipping cream, which is very unlike me! But it's hubby's birthday and I didn't want to skimp on fat. LOL I used 3 T each butter and shortening and 2 tsp vanilla for an extra kick. This looks gorgeous on the cake and I'm sure he'll love it. Thanks again."
52543,80118,2005-04-26,5,"Like your Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (89207), this is quick & easy to make - also delish! I used it to crown a half dozen chocolate cupcakes & froze the rest for another day. Thanx Kitten!"
18391,80118,2005-09-23,5,Excellent icing! I used about 3 1/2 cups of sugar .. thanks for posting this!
142464,80118,2005-12-29,5,"Mmmmm, such a smooth creamy icing - great for cookie decorating Christmas treats. Let's see, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter - this recipe will definitely be used quite a bit in this household to enhance cookies, cakes and cupcakes.  Thank you for sharing."
191533,80118,2006-03-03,5,"Delicious; gets dry to the touch like good decorator's icing should. I modified the recipe and I don't know exact amounts, but this definitely won't frost and fill a 9 inch 2-layer cake. Instead of vanilla flavoring, I added a few drops of peppermint extract and some creme de menthe syrup. (I was frosting a dark chocolate cake.) When I saw the amount the recipe was making, I dumped in 2 more cups 10X sugar. Then I added cream and flavoring until I had the right taste and consistency. It turned out superb- a taste like homemade wedding mints! "
169969,80118,2006-10-15,5,"This is a wonderful icing recipe. The icing is not too sweet and it is thick enough to work with. I used it to frost cupcakes and added some blue decorator's icing and came up with a beautiful baby blue color. This is PERFECT cupcake icing and I will never use anything else. Thanks Kitz, What would I do without you?!"
180090,80118,2007-04-08,5,This made a great frosting for my yellow cake cupcakes! It was easy to make and very rich and creamy. It was fun to color the frosting different colors for Easter. Thanks for the recipe Kit! I'll be using it whenever I need buttercream frosting!
149363,80118,2007-04-09,5,"Fantastic icing that my 6 year old and I enjoyed making. She iced her easter cupcakes with this and added a jelly bean on top.
It was a hit with the 8 kids we had for dinner! I'll use this one all the time now, thanks Carol!"
373817,80118,2007-04-13,5,"Man, this is SO good! I can't even believe that I made it! It's so easy to make and very delicious on the chocolate cupcakes that I just made! It's one hundred times better than the frosting that you buy in the store! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!"
176615,80118,2007-04-30,5,Fantastic frosting! Buttercream is my favorite and I can't remember ever having eaten one better than this. Please don't buy the gross stuff in the can when something this good is so easy to make! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
461834,80118,2007-11-24,5,I made this to go with a homemade chocolate cake for Thanksgiving.  This is delicious!!!!!  I used heavy whipping cream as I wasn't sure what 35% meant.  I used half the recipe as I was only making half the chocolate cake and it was plenty.
400420,80118,2008-02-03,5,"Delicious and easy to use.  I made Recipe #158199 and used this frosting and Recipe #266529 to decorate.  Turned out great!  Thanks again, Kittencal!"
218535,80118,2008-02-29,3,The frosting is just not smooth enough to spread evenly. I'll keep looking for a great buttercream.
47559,80118,2008-05-28,5,"Another 5 stars for a winning recipe. This will be my frosting recipe from now on. Delicious and creamy, and so quick and easy to make. Consistency was spot on. I can't wait to try it with the Cool Whip or whipped cream. Thanks for sharing it."
499050,80118,2008-06-17,5,Yum.
32058,80118,2008-09-15,4,"This was a bit overly sweet. I'm sure the addition of cool whip or cream cheese would tone it down a bit. But as written it is over the top sweet for my taste. I do like the strong REAL butter flavor. UPDATE:  I made this again with the additon of cool whip and 8 oz cream cheese and it was good, just as written it is way too sweet.  Would make again with additions.  Was delicious on pound cake."
497077,80118,2008-10-19,5,"What a great recipe for frosting-fast and easy!!! I used butter and half and half. Needed a pink icing so added a couple drops of red food coloring-came out perfect! Thank you, Kitten, for a DELICIOUS recipe! Made for the Think Pink Tag Game In Honor of Breast Cancer Awareness, October 2008."
91392,80118,2008-11-02,4,"Very sweet, very soft.  Made a nice glossy frosting for cupcakes and the top pf a cake for me, but wouldn't be a decorating frosting without a lot more powdered sugar.  Good taste, a bit too sweet maybe.  SIMPLE to make though and will use again."
92816,80118,2008-11-23,4,"I just made this icing to put on  Lemon Bundt Cake #110604. It was the perfect amount for a tube pan cake.You may need about another 1/2 icing recipe if you were making a layer cake.I used 3 tbsp of milk and added 1/2 tsp almond extract.I did not use any food coloring.
The icing is a little sweet,never thought I would say that!I love sweet!I have the iced cake in the fridge now.I find when icing is cold is doesn't taste so sweet.Great easy recipe!Thanks!"
485151,80118,2009-04-18,5,"Great frosting! I usually just make frosting by ""eyeing it"", but this was much better having measurements to follow. I used magarine & milk because that'w what I had on hand. I'd love to try it with real butter & cream next time.

ETA: I just made this again with real butter and half & half. It is great! It was for an Orange Dreamsicle cake, so I used orange extract instead of vanilla and I'm in love with this frosting!"
520150,80118,2009-05-05,5,I used this for a bridal shower cake - to rave reviews.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!.  I will use this as my go-to cake recipe for the future.
126440,80118,2009-07-18,5,I cut this down to make 1/2 c. to use on Recipe #301337.  Very rich and easy to do.
324621,80118,2009-07-24,5,Worked great!
482376,80118,2010-03-14,5,Perfect recipe for buttercream frosting. It made the perfect amount for my two layer cake. The flavoring and consistency are perfect. Thank you so much!
140132,80118,2010-08-01,5,Great frosting recipe.  I used this recipe to frost DD's cake she made and this recipe worked wonderful.  It held its own when decorating which was exactly what we were looking for.  Yummy tasting frosting too.  Thank you for sharing.
532289,10744,2009-10-22,5,Made as directed except I added    1 t thyme.  Very good.  Even my picky 7 year old ate it up.
187373,80118,2014-04-22,5,Oh wow! This was delicious! I used it on my Easter bunny cake this year. So delicious! I used whole milk and only used 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Was the perfect amount to cover the cake with just a little leftover. Will use this again!
251626,80118,2014-11-20,5,Excellent
29014,10744,2003-12-14,5,"The cream-dreamiest chicken pot pie ever!  This is permanent comfort food in my cookbook.  I added a handful of frozen peas but changed nothing else.  I made the filling ahead of time, refrigerated, and then just added the crust and baked when we were ready to eat - how easy is that?!"
37036,10744,2005-03-13,5,"Great pot pies!  I used a whole chicken (used have the chicken for this recipe and the other half for another). I followed the directions exactly, except that I added a small can of drained peas and I used homemade pie crust.  I made these in the pot pie tins and it made 6.  I froze these before baking.  When baking frozen pies, place on baking sheet and bake at 375F for about 50 minutes.  These were awesome!  I will be making these often, thanks Vincy!"
97579,10744,2005-06-14,5,"This was absolutely delicious!!  I followed the recipe to a T and found that it filled 2 9"" pie crusts to the rim.  If you want it really super full, you might have to double recipe, but it was perfect for me, my DH and 3 kids.  I will definately be making again!  Thanks"
52262,10744,2005-09-07,5,"Excellent and oh so yummy chicken pot pie! I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan and had a little filling left over. I used kfinkle's idea and covered the chicken with broth and two bay leafs and cooked it. I drained the broth and reused it for the filling. Changes I made in addition to doubling the recipe: used low sodium broth, fat-free 1/2 and 1/2, threw in some peas, and used top and bottom crusts. I will definitely make again!"
146047,10744,2005-10-23,5,"Yum, this was great. Added peas and mushrooms, used leftover pork roast rather than chicken, and used both top and bottom crusts. Thanks!"
136997,10744,2006-01-21,5,"Well, I don't know what else to add, It's a tasty as everyone has said. The only addition I made, was to include a bit of rubbed sage. Just a personal taste. I also used homemade stock and crust. Delicious! :) "
138429,10744,2006-03-14,5,"I had never made a Chicken Pot Pie and chose this recipe to use as my first. This was absolutely wonderful with excellent flavor. I cooked the chicken on the George Foreman Grill. I used a boxed pie crust mix,  and  it was prepared before too long. DH  loved it  and was happy there were left overs. Thanks for sharing this great recipe. "
229850,10744,2006-08-17,5,"Never made chicken pot pie before, this was just wonderful. I did also add peas as some others did, and I used heavy cream as that is what I had on hand. I will be making this often with leftover chicken. I too was puzzled with the two crusts and no instruction for bottom, but I did use one on bottom as other reviewer and it was awesome. Thanx for a new experience for me and the results were fabulous!"
222564,10744,2006-12-14,5,"Scrumptious! May take a little time, maybe, but is not too complicated at all. Very good trouble - result ratio. I used 2 chicken bouillon cubes and no salt and skimmed milk for half'n'half. Very rich and creamy anyhow. Might try some herb for change, like a little thyme or rosemary, or Herb's de Provence that has both and more."
59473,10744,2007-01-07,5,This was absolutely delicious. It really was not much bother to make. I left out the diced potatoes because I served it with mashed potatoes. I also added some frozen peas to it. Thanks for a great recipe.
373817,10744,2007-03-25,5,"This is such a great recipe! I halved the recipe, putting it in an 8x8"" pan, and I baked it for about a half an hour. I also made my own crust and it was absolutely delicious! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
255338,10744,2007-04-11,5,"Except for substituting regular milk for the half and half, I made the recipe as written. I doubled the sauce part though because my kids like a saucier filling. Oh, I also added a bit of paprika for a little zing. Like the name said, it was a delicious chicken pot pie, one we will make a lot from now on. Thank you for sharing."
285039,10744,2007-04-23,4,"Very simple and easy way to prepare chicken (or turkey, in my case)pot pie.  I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie cursts, which made it simple enough for a work night."
182624,10744,2007-05-06,4,"Great and easy pot pie!  The leftovers were even better.  I cut out ""I [heart] U"" from the leftover dough and placed on top of the crust; it was a sweet surprise for the husband and kids.  My husband especially loved this one.  Thanks for a keeper!"
81611,10744,2007-09-17,5,"Doesn't get much better than this. I agree with the rater that said that it tastes so much better than the ones with cream-of-yuck soup. I somehow missed the instruction to use 2 dishes; I just dumped it all into a round casserole, put both crusts on top, and THEN started reading reviews that made me think I had missed something. Well, I couldn't change it, but it turned out just fine and dandy anyway. We did have to add salt at the table, but only because I had forgotten to add salt to my homemade stock. Our family of 5 left only about 1/2 of a serving. This is a keeper!"
400420,10744,2007-10-07,4,"Super easy and great tasting!  My sauce came out a little pasty, but that could be because I used fat free half & half.  I also thought it needed a little more flavor, so I added a few shakes of thyme, basil, parsley, sage and garlic seasoning. I'm sure I'll be making this again!  Thank you!"
158086,10744,2007-10-15,5,Wow what a recipe...I did not even think I liked Pot pie....This is a real winner...I did change and instead of doing carrots I added a 10 oz pkg of frozen mixed veggies with the potatoes and celery....I will be making this for my sunday dinners for the family this winter for sure.
447123,10744,2007-10-31,5,Shame on me for not reviewing earlier!!! This really is so so easy and so so great. I have never made any pie. SO I was a bit nervouse. I bought the pilsbury pie crust and it turned out so so darn good!! Really great and simple comfort food. GOt to try it. Is sure to impress all!!!
58836,10744,2007-11-17,5,"Finally made this after wanting to for a while and it was really good.  Should have known it would be with all the good reviews.  Didn't have half and half so just used milk.  Good, sure I'll make again.  Thanks"
32058,10744,2007-12-27,4,This was good on a wintry day. the rest of the family was so-so on it.
140132,10744,2008-01-01,5,First attempt at making a pot pie and it turned our wonderful.  We loved it.  I was leary about it being to runny when it was done but no such thing.  This was perfect and far better then those store bought ones.  Thank you for a new recipe that will be part of our main menus.....Stephanie
125640,10744,2008-01-06,4,"Perfect for a cold, rainy day. It's a bit time consuming, but tastes good. The first time I made this we thought the sauce was on the plain side, so this time I added 1/4 tsp each garlic powder, thyme, and marjoram and will even add a little more next time. I also added 2/3 cup each mushrooms and peas. Thanks for sharing."
486718,10744,2008-02-01,5,This was excellant! Not to hard just a lot of prep work.  I made exactly as stated and it turned out wonderful.  This was my first attempt at chicken pot pie so I was definately pleased. Thanks!!
222970,10744,2008-07-09,4,"A little on the bland side but otherwise good comfort food.

Because of the nutrition facts (calories and fat grams) probably not more than a once-a-year dinner for us."
280166,10744,2008-10-22,5,"Oh my gosh! FINALLY a recipe that my whole family loves, not just eats without comment, not just likes, but LOVES! The four of us polished this off in one setting. I used recipe #33104 for the chicken. I also added an extra potato so my total potatoes was almost 2 cups. I first cooked the potatoes for about 5 mins in the microwave just to be sure it was done. I used my mandoline slicer for the other veggies and everything came together quickly. I also used 2% milk successfully in place of the half and half. A wonderful winter meal! Thanks for posting!"
88099,10744,2008-10-31,4,Excellent.  Flavors went well.  Easy to make.  A lot of the juices spilled over while cooking.  I think next time I'll used a little bigger dish to cook it in.  I also put one of the pie crust on the bottom and cooked it for about 10 minutes before adding the filling.  Worked out well.  Thanks
278113,10744,2008-11-08,5,"I made mine into 2 seperate pie pans of pot pie, and it worked perfectly! Added a can of mixed veggies to one, and frozen veggies to the other to accomodate everyones tastes in our house. Everyone was happy and thought it was just delicious!  We will make this again and again, thank you for sharing this fab recipe!"
203325,10744,2008-11-29,5,"Yum!!!  This was a wonderful chicken pot pie.  I used both a top and bottom crust.  The only time consuming thing was chopping the vegetables, otherwise, this is a really simple recipe.  I cooked the veggies a little to long, so the potatoes started to fall apart.  I added one more potato right before I poured the mixture into the pie crust so I would have some potato chunks in the pie."
218535,10744,2008-12-30,5,The best chicken pot pie I ever had.
1072593,10744,2009-02-03,5,"Vincy, honey, if you held this recipe ransom, I'd think we'd have some negotiating to do.  Like another chef said, it's the potatoes that makes the difference.  Home cooking at it's best from over 300 test kitchens!"
126440,10744,2009-03-26,5,Excellent chicken pot pie.  I love the sauce.  I thought it was easy and has great flavor. I did add a few fresh mushrooms when cooking the veggies maybe next time I'll try broccoli.
44383,10744,2009-03-29,2,"Made this tonight exactly as directed and was not very impressed.  The filling was rather bland tasting, I think suggestions to add additional spices should be heeded.  I've always used an eggwash for my pie crust but didn't this time so I could say I followed the directions exactly.  I wish I had used it as the crust was crumbly and dried out.  I'll be going back to my tried and true chicken pot pie recipe, I truly don't understand all the rave reviews for this one."
808027,10744,2009-08-17,5,"This one is a definite keeper and will immediately go into my ""favorites"" file.  I had already cooked the chicken beforehand so putting this together was a snap.  I added some frozen peas into the veggie mixture when cooking.  This turned out perfectly...thanks!"
485151,10744,2009-10-25,5,"Loved this!!! I used a little more potato (we're tater lovers), nixed the celery and added half a bag of frozen peas and carrots. Didn't have any half-and-half, so used a substitute of of 1 cup 2% milk & half a stick of butter. This will be added into our menu rotation for sure!"
937635,10744,2009-12-03,5,"Decadent! Awesome! And I haven't even tried the finished pie yet (just the sauce) :) I used leftover turkey from Thanxgiving, skipped the celery bc I didn't have any, used heavy cream instead of 1/2 and 1/2 (what I had on hand), added between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp of Thyme per other reviews and about 1 cup of frozen peas. I plan on packing it all into two sets of two pie crusts from Trader Joe's so it will make 2 full chicken pot pies with a pie crust on the top and bottom of each pie. Wow! Thanks Vincy!

ETA: I fit all of the filling into one pie crust in a pie tin - mounded it on the top, but fit it in - and topped it with the second crust and it was perfect. I had maybe 1/4 cup left over and the baby and I shared it for a snack."
198154,10744,2010-01-09,4,"My husband likes pot pie but the rest of us don't care for peas or pie crust.  So I took your recipe and subtituted veggie broth, and a bag of quorn tenders for the chicken broth and chicken so I wouldn't have to make a second for the vegetarians.  I did everything else as directed except I lowered the oven temp to 375 and topped it with reduced fat cresent roll dough. Popped it in the oven until golden.  It was delish.  Thanks so much for a great begining to a hot comfort meal on a cold night."
333017,10744,2010-02-10,0,"I was looking to make chicken pot  with a creamier base...but using up the frozen veggies and mushrooms I had on hand    I sauteed the mushrooms in butter, then followed the recipe exactly regarding the sauce.  I agree with the other reviewers that the seasoning could be kicked up a little bit.  I topped the mixture with some puff pastry.  My family enjoyed it and there was enough leftovers for lunch the next day.  I plan on trying this recipe with the potatoes and veggies...but would probably stick to a puff pastry for the topping as I am not keen on that much pastry.  Thanks for the posting!!"
1269015,10744,2010-08-18,4,"I left out the potato, subbed the margarine for oil, use 4 c. rice cooked in veggie broth instead of the chicken, and subbed the chicken broth with veggie broth and the half and half for soy milk as well. We were pretty happy with this, though I may add in more pepper and other spices next time and swap out 1 c. of the rice with another veggie -- peas probably. Thanks for sharing!"
439797,10744,2010-10-03,5,"I made it for 12 servings, instead of 8 and cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I used two Pillsbury Crusts and that was plenty, just on top.  I added 1/2 cup white wine, used 2 cups half and half (a little extra) some poultry seasoning and a dash of nutmeg.  Made it all ahead of time and then baked it later in the day.  A great recipe for a fall day!"
1133190,10744,2010-11-19,5,I'm not a big chicken pot pie person but this was really really good!  Everyone had seconds.  It does take a while to make but it worth it if that's what you are craving.  The only thing I changed was adding a little garlic (maybe 1tsp) while cooking the veggies.  I used my mom's no fail pie crust recipe and it was perfect. Thanks!
2041603,10744,2011-10-27,5,"Wow! This is fantastic! We will use an extra potato next time. Thought it was easy enough to make. We used our own dough and added a few dashes of marjoram, garlic and basil to the mixture. Can't wait to try again!"
529278,10744,2011-11-07,5,"SO SO SO good!!!  We used turkey breast instead of chicken, because that's what they had prepared at the grocery store, and I don't like cooking chicken.  The fresh veggies we used were celery, carrots, onions, and a can each of peas and corn.  After reading reviews, we added some poultry seasoning to give it a bit more flavor.  My husband really wanted puff pastry crust for the top.  It was good, but I missed the 15 minute timer, and the puff pastry was overdone.  I will have to watch more carefully next time.  For a bottom crust, I used my MIL pie crust recipe, and it was delicious.  We made 4 cocottes and a 7x11 casserole dish.  There was a little left that didn't fit in the dish, but that's what my 4 year old ate.  She found it less offensive without the crust.  I had some as leftovers today, and I'm excited to have MORE leftovers for dinner!!!!  YUM!"
666723,10744,2012-04-29,4,"Much, much better than any pot pie I have made with a can of cream of chicken.  Really loved the creaminess and how thick it was.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a little bland for my taste.  I tasted the mixture before pouring it in the dish and added sage, thyme, and rosemary for some flavor.  I used a rotisserie chicken which was the perfect amount and shredded it...soooo good!!  It makes a lot.  Really tasty."
540346,10744,2013-03-05,5,"EXCELLENT meal!  This was my first time making pot pie and it was so worth it!  I had to stop myself from eating seconds and thirds.  We had meat from a pork roast we had smoked and that is the meat I used.  I also made a homemade pie crust (recipe # 26205) to put on top.  Other than that, I made as directed.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you for an awesome recipe."
187373,10744,2013-08-29,5,"Delicious chicken pot pie! I wasn&#039;t sure how much this would make, but I made a half recipe and it ended up overflowing a regular pie dish. I only used a top crust to make it a *little* lighter. It was easy to make using a homemade pie crust out of the freezer and leftover roasted chicken. I added some peas as well. My toddler son won&#039;t touch it, but DH liked it. Thanks for a great recipe!"
369715,10744,2013-11-25,4,I used a can of mixed vegetables instead of the vegetables called for in the recipe. I also added a teaspoon of pepper. We all enjoyed this but thought the gravy could have had a tad more seasoning in it.
91392,10744,2014-04-03,5,Super!  I made it with two crusts in a pie plate.  Brushed bottom crust with egg white and let dry 5 minutes before adding filling.  Brushed top crust with egg white before baking.  Exactly a perfect pot pie.
37779,10744,2014-07-05,5,Outstanding. I used rotisserie chicken and well-seasoned chicken broth. The filling was creamy and nothing but delicious. This was much easier to make than my gran&#039;s recipe and tastes just as good (maybe better). My fam and I love comfort food and I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
1581225,10744,2015-01-28,5,"Great flavour, overall a beautiful warming, hearty meal."
175824,10744,2016-03-07,5,this was delicious. I used a bottom crust as my family and I like it that way. I also added some peas. I was simple to make and not at all time consuming as I used a vegetable cutter to dice up all the vegetables. It was nice because all the veggies were the same size. Thanks for sharing&gt; I will be making the again and again.
894666,10744,2017-03-08,5,"I've made this twice now, the first time exactly as stated and it was an excellent base recipe as far as the veggies but I felt like the filling needed more flavor. Also I wasn't happy with the crust recipe I used so decided to give it another go tonight and with a few tiny tweaks it turned out AWESOME. To modify it, I made sure to sprinkle poultry seasoning (very generously) on the chicken before baking in the oven the day before assembling the pie. Subbed garlic salt instead of regular for filling, didn't taste garlicky just added a little something, also used white pepper instead of black. Used some skim and some whip cream for the half and half. This turned out GRUB, we each had two huge portions and honestly I could have had a third. Thanks for posting, I finally have a pot pie I am proud of!"
8629,110078,2005-02-20,5,I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.
50969,110078,2006-07-12,4,"This was a very goodsauce for the chops,but my SO and I thought that it needed a little more""kick"" to it.So the next time I make this I'm going to add another 1/2 teaspoon more chili powder. As someone else suggested I left out the water,and I'm glad I did.And as for the cooking time I'm going to cut it back to about 5 hours or so,because at 6 hours it was very dry.Thank you for posting."
33159,110078,2006-08-12,5,"Delicious & easy way to prepare pork chops!!  To save on fat & calories, I omitted the oil.  The sauce was flavourful & kept the pork very tender."
7108,110078,2006-09-03,4,"I made the tasty sauce the night before (I did not have fresh garlic on hand so I added 3/8 of a tsp of garlic powder;) and had hubby throw the chops and sauce in the crockpot at noon....dinner was ready 5 1/2 hours later (I used 1/4 inch thin cut bone-in chops) with the tender meat just falling off the bone.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp of chili powder to the sauce.  Next time, I may cut down or omit the water, as another reviewer suggested.  I served with rice pilaf, corn and rolls.  I'm always looking for new ways to prepare bone-in chops; this was no-fuss...thanks for posting!"
32772,110078,2007-02-27,5,"Yum, Yum, Yummy!  A quick, easy and delicious meal. Followed directions and cooked on LOW for 9 hours. The pork chops were falling apart and the sauce wasn't runny. Served with mashed potatoes. A true keeper."
74281,110078,2007-04-02,4,"We really loved this recipe once it was done, but I did use the preferred bone in pork chops and I will not do that next time! The pork chops fell apart and digging the bones out was really difficult. In the end, the sauce was delicious! I used Low Carb Ketchup as we ar watching our carbs. I will try this again soon with either boneless pork chops or a pork roast that I will shred after it is cooked. I served this with green beans but since DD doesn't like them, I wrapped the pork in a LC Tortilla and covered it with the sauce and melted cheese. DELICIOUS!!"
358796,110078,2007-04-08,4,"Tasty and nice and tender pork. Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Good basic chili pork chop recipe, and easy to put together."
286851,110078,2007-08-08,4,"We enjoyed the taste and ease of making this crock pot recipe. Followed recipe as directed. The chops had a good taste, however I too had the problem of small bones pieces once the meal was done. We had to be wary of picking out bone pieces for our two toddler-age children. Would probably use boneless next time."
264017,110078,2007-12-12,4,"These were tasty and very tender, but I was hoping for a tangier sauce. I used butterfly chops and simmered the leftover sauce til thickened to use as a dip-in for the meat."
369715,110078,2008-05-19,5,"This was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly as written and I would not change a thing. I didn't cook this in the crockpot because I woke up late this morning and didn't have time before going to work. So when I got home, I followed the directions through step two and then I placed everything in a pan and placed the sauce on top. I grilled for about 45 minutes. These were so good. I would make this again."
55578,110078,2008-05-24,4,A nice easy recipe for chops and a crock pot.  Will make again!
158086,110078,2008-11-18,5,Very good!  Great taste and it makes your house smell heavenly...
218535,110078,2009-01-21,1,I was very disappointed. I just don't think this tasted that good.
637486,110078,2009-03-01,5,"This is a great recipe!  I was skeptical about the chops being so tender that they would fall off the bone, but that's exactly what they did.  I used boneless chops and followed the other reviews and reduced the cooking time to 5 hours.  This will definitely be a regular at the dinner table!  Thanks!"
844554,110078,2009-03-19,4,"This was very, very good. I only used 2 thin bone-in chops so cooking time and ingredients were cut down. But the sauce made it and the chops were tender, too. I did add more chili powder. Going in keeper file. Thanks."
55729,110078,2009-05-09,4,"This turned out well. I used boneless pork sirloin chops. High marks from my roommate, but I thought the meat was a bit dry."
666723,110078,2009-11-07,3,These were okay.  The pork did come out really tender and delicious but I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the sauce.  Not sure if it was the ketchup or what but it just didn't do it for me.
81611,110078,2009-11-24,3,Ditto on Melvin'sWifey's comment.
371738,110078,2010-02-07,3,"The sauce did not penetrate the chops enough for us.  Not bad, but no plans to make again."
774665,110078,2010-02-21,5,We really liked these. I love that it's a quick weeknight meal. I used apple juice instead of water and only used 1/4 cup. This makes a nice gravy to serve over mashed potatoes.
92816,110078,2011-09-17,5,"These were so unbelievably fall apart delicious!I don't normally even buy pork chops anymore because I can never get them tasty or tender enough.Problem solved!I used 4 pork chops,no bone.I cooked them on high for 2 hours and then on low for 2 hours.I served them with fried rice and the leftover sauce was good on the rice also."
140132,110078,2012-05-23,5,What a great chop recipe.  I loved the sauce in this.  Thanks for a great recipe.
839492,110078,2012-08-10,4,"Simple, yummy and flavorful. The pork chops (mine were thin) basically fell apart (tender). I would love to try this again with thick cut pork chops. I too placed unpeeled whole baby red potatoes, a whole vadallia onion and the garlic in the bottom of the pot, placed the pork chops atop the vegetables and topped with the sauce.  Probably used half of the amount of the water called for, doubled the cumin & chili powder, lastly adding a dash of cinnamon. This was a keeper. I may try a little lime juice in the sauce next time for that chili-lime flavor. Served with steamed broccoli. Thanks for sharing an inspiring recipe!"
191533,110078,2013-08-31,5,"Delicious! Served with Tex-Mex Rice on the side. I put a few chunks of onion in the bottom of the crock-pot, and only used 2 chops. Kept the sauce ingred. the same. Delicious! We ate 1 1/2 hours later than I had planned, but these were still perfect! Fall off the bone tender."
37449,456858,2011-06-30,5,"This was so easy and good too. I actually used mine in a salad, which worked well. Thanks!"
333017,178742,2006-07-27,4,"I love roasted asparagus....would not have it any other way!!!  I have chopped some shallots and garlic and added it to the mix.  I do cut down on the oils, as I am particularly sensitive to them.  Overall, fantastic recipe"
305531,178742,2009-03-06,5,Great side dish! Simple and very tasty. Thanks Shelia in Alaska for a nice new winner.
383346,178742,2012-03-19,5,I cooked them a 5 minutes more because I had big asparagus.  They had a great taste.  Thanks Sheila :)  Made for PAC Spring 2012
37305,38641,2002-11-25,5,"Made this for my family, who love meatloaf.  I am not a meatloaf lover myself, but have to admit that this was the best meatloaf I have ever eaten.  Smelled great cooking and the rest of the family could not get enough!  All I heard was ""Awesome"" through the whole meal.  I used 2 lbs. of 85/15 ground beef, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My mixture was VERY wet, to the point that I could not even shape it, but I just kind of poured it into the loaf pan and the texture after cooking was fine and it sliced great without falling apart.  Took about 1 1/2 hours to cook through since it was larger.  Thanks for the great recipe...unfortunately, there was none left for sandwiches :("
46660,38641,2003-02-18,5,"Delicious!  I used bread crumbs instead of saltine crumbs.  I used a little less than 1/2 cup milk, and it was very easily molded.  Wonderful flavor!  Easy too!"
91392,38641,2003-11-16,4,"Good meatloaf.  We liked the sweetness, some may not.  I think using salsa in the recipe is a must."
8629,38641,2004-06-15,4,I made the suggested version of putting half of the brown sugar and chili sauce on the bottom of the meat loaf pan and the other on top of the meat loaf.  Cooking time for me was 1 hour and 15 minutes.
169969,38641,2004-12-26,5,Excellent Meatloaf!!! I used the chili sauce instead of the ketchup as suggested. Everyone loved it and I will make it again! Awesome leftovers!!! Thank you!
176615,38641,2005-03-02,5,"A lovely meatloaf that my whole family enjoyed. I used the ketchup version to entice the kids and enjoyed it very much myself. I do think chili sauce or salsa would be fabulous. Only changes I made were to use extra lean ground beef and plain toasted bread crumbs. Thanks, yooper, for a keeper!"
189616,38641,2005-08-27,4,"The meatloaf itself was perfect, moist and sliced beautifully. Didn't care for the sauce though too sweet for our tastes. Next time will omit the sauce.
Thank You yooper!
"
324621,38641,2006-12-01,5,This was wonderful! We all loved it. I used only 1 pound of ground beef and added some oats (about 1/2 c.) in addition to the saltine cracker crumbs to help absorb some of the extra liquid. It turned out perfect! Served with corn on the cob and fresh steamed carrots. Delicious meal!
207176,38641,2007-01-22,4,"I followed recipe (but forgot milk, oops) and cut sugar and ketchup to 1/4 cup.  It was pretty good but not as good as some others I've made on this site.  I would have preferred glaze on top. There was a lot of liquid even though I used lean beef. It seemed like the fat melted into the bottom of the pan where the brown sugar and Ketchup were, and diluted them."
37779,38641,2007-01-23,5,"Delicious meatloaf, yooper. I like a sweetish sauce on meatloaf but I wasn't sure how putting the brown sugar and ketchup on the bottom would work out. Nothing to worry about, though. Just made a nice sweet, tangy sauce that I spooned over the meatloaf after I sliced it. The loaf was very tender and held together well. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
386849,38641,2007-01-30,5,"Really liked this, thanks for posting! I did use leftover stuffing in place of the saltines which worked just fine."
56087,38641,2007-05-30,4,"This is the first time I've been able to keep a meatloaf together.
I drained the meatloaf and I think that was a mistake as most of the ""sweetness"" ran out.  Next time I'll put it on top."
136997,38641,2007-09-23,5,"Deeelicious! My husband loved this. I used half the sauce on the bottom and the other on the top. Baked for 1 1/2 hours, because I used 2 lbs. of beef. Had to make sure there were leftovers for his work dinner. :)"
73469,38641,2008-01-27,5,"This is the best meatloaf that I've ever had. I love,love,love this stuff! The gravy this meatloaf makes is wonderful.  I make this all the time. If your not a big meatloaf eater, I would suggest this for you."
140132,38641,2008-02-20,4,"This is a good meatloaf recipe.  DH thought it was a little too sweet, but DD loved it.  I will make again when DH is out of town.  Thank you for posting....Stephanie"
774665,38641,2008-04-09,5,This is really close to the recipe I've been making for years and I love it. I  like that you put the ketchup on the bottom instead of the top. I cooked the onions before adding them to the meat so we wouldn't have the raw onion that we don't like and I cut down the sugar because sometimes a whole half cup makes it too sweet for us. This makes a wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes.
218535,38641,2008-05-03,3,The brown sugar made this too sweet for us. I prefer Recipe #15027 for meatloafs.
307214,38641,2008-09-05,5,The only meatloaf recipe -- I am allowed to use.  I only use about 1/4 cup brown sugar and line my pan with foil to make serving a little easier.  We eat this often!
286851,38641,2008-11-02,4,Very good meatloaf. I followed poster's suggestion to use chili sauce instead of ketchup. I liked that it had ingredients that I normally have on hand. Thanks for sharing!
1133190,38641,2009-02-28,5,For someone who doesn't like meatloaf - this is great! I substituted italian bread crumbs for the saltine crumbs and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I also put the ketchup/brown sugar mixture on top.  The one problem I seem to have is that some of the meat is still a bit pink even after an hour.
532289,38641,2009-09-16,5,"I too got this one from the ""other"" site.  It is one of my favorites."
810787,38641,2011-03-16,5,This did not disappoint us. It was a great meat loaf!
43083,38641,2011-07-29,5,"Loved the brown sugar/ketchup ""crust"". I used brown sugar Splenda. Instead of saltines, I used oats but that was my only sub. Thanks for sharing. I will make again."
529278,38641,2011-10-13,5,"I LOVED this meatloaf!  So moist and sweet.  There was no need for extra sauce with this one!  My 6 year old wanted to eat just this for dinner, and our 4 year old ate without complaint.  I used chili sauce, since we were quite low on ketchup, and used onion powder instead of onion, because I was low on time.  Took about an hour and 10 minutes to reach 170 in a convection oven, but it was in there with baked potatoes and I had almost 2 pounds of meat.  It came together so quickly and easily, too.  I'm excited to have a new meatloaf recipe!"
540346,38641,2012-11-06,5,"This was a really good meatloaf.  I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it is just the right amount of sweet.  The only difference I made was to add two cloves of minced garlic.  I will make this again!"
394077,38641,2013-01-02,5,"Moist and delicious.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfect. Also, the next time, I would put the sugar/ketchup on top of the mealoaf instead of being on the bottom.  Other than that, this is a keeper recipe."
185446,38641,2014-09-01,5,"I&#039;m such a fan of yooper&#039;s recipes, how could I have missed this one?  So easy &amp; simple, yet the best meatloaf I&#039;ve ever made.  Well formed and tasty.  I used sweet chili sauce instead of catsup.  Gave the meat a nice tang.  I&#039;ve finally found a meatloaf recipe that will be made more than once...thanks for yet another good recipe, yooper."
52125,59224,2003-06-16,5,"This was Excellent! The roast turned out moist and tender and the spicy part was the best of all.
I shredded it in my processer roughly and put it in a skillet and added the cooking liquid and cooked it down until almost all the liquid cooked out and then served it on fryed taco shells and it turned out perfect. Next time I will make sandwiches and use the juices for dipping. Thanks Minkie.."
29014,59224,2003-08-04,5,"I made this recipe exactly as posted and it was excellent!  The meat was falling-apart tender and the seasoning was delicious.  I had my Mexican neighbors over and when I told them the recipe had chipotles in adobo they thought the beef would be very spicy-hot, but it wasn't - it was perfect for our taste!  I served this on rolls like hot beef sandwiches, but would be great for tacos, too.  Thanks for a keeper, Minkie!"
101823,59224,2004-03-23,5,I had some lamb roasts in the freezer and decided to try this recipe using that instead of beef.  The meat was flavorful and tender.  It was great to come home to the spicy aromas in the kitchen.  This will become a staple for us for our tacos and enchiladas.
59780,59224,2004-04-13,5,This was a great recipe. Easy to prepare and the whole house smelledgreat while it was cooking. I found this recipe while looking for ways to use the chipotle chilis in adobo sauce that I purchased while on a trip to the States. My husband loves spicy things and this was a real treat for him. We made tacos with all the fixings! I will make this again after I replenish my stock of those chipotle peppers! My husband thanks you for sharing this great recipe. The leftovers froze very well too!
47559,59224,2004-06-27,5,"I used a pork loin roast, and didn't add the chipotles because I wanted to make it mild this time. We served it on tortillas with cilantro and sour cream.  It was delicious - very moist, tender and well seasoned.  I will try it with chipotles next time for a spicier version. "
60989,59224,2004-06-27,5,"I must confess that I made this a day early for dinner tomorrow, but I can't stop grabbing tastes! This is so awesome Denise! I love it! The smell while cooking was to die for. But the TASTE, OMG, the taste is incredible! I only used one can of chipotle chiles so my son would be able to eat it, and being a spicy whimp, that is enough for me too. I can see that I have more than enough for a taco dinner for tomorrow and burritos for the freezer. I am floored at how incredible this tastes, even better than the machaca at our local mexican restaurant. Just awesome. Thanks so much Denise. "
119466,59224,2005-03-20,5,"Very good! Served wrapped in tortillas along with guacamole and sour cream. I followed the recipe, but next time I think I will use a pork roast and add additional chipotles. I didn't find it as spicy as expected and think I would prefer this type of dish made with pork, rather than beef. Nice to have dinner simmering all day and ready to eat at dinnertime. Thanks for the recipe!"
39835,59224,2005-07-14,4,Very good! We served this on tortillas topped with cheddar cheese and salsa.  I used only one tablespoon of chili powder but next time I will use the full amount. Thanks for sharing!
174991,59224,2006-05-02,5,I used a couple of pork chops and scaled down the recipe.  I omitted the salt and pepper and used my own salsa instead of the salsa verde.  I served this over Whole Wheat Corn Bread recipe #80963.  Very tasty.
278113,59224,2006-08-31,5,"Soooo good!! I used 2 chipotles, and it was pretty darn hot. (we like spicy!) We ate it on tortillas, and once you added the toppings, the spice was great. It was a bit too spicy for my children though, so next time, we will just try one chipotle. I made this for guests, and everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing this easy, (YUMMY) recipe!!"
173579,59224,2006-10-26,5,This was just wonderful.  We loved it!  I used it all the different ways you stated.  I'm sure it could be used many more ways.  Great recipe.  Thanks for posting.
236170,59224,2007-04-02,5,"So flavorful and spicy! I served it on buns for the first night, and then in beef tacos with the leftovers. Very easy and delicious!"
520150,59224,2007-07-01,5,"I made this ahead of time to serve at a dinner party.  I followed the recipe, except that I blended the chipotle, green chilies, salsa verde, onions & garlic.  One of the reasons for doing so was to hid them from the dh.  He's not so hot about chilies & onions & would probably pick them out.  I loved this.  So did everyone else. By the way, I left it just a little ""juicy"" when I made it because it would be heated up the next day - it was perfect. All the recipes I used are in my menu ""Mexican Dinner Party"".  Thank you for a wonderful recipe & will use again!"
182624,59224,2007-07-02,5,"This was fantastic!!  Very easy to make and the results are outstanding.  I couldn't find salsa verde and didn't have time to make my own, so I used a garlic fire-roasted tomato salsa; probably not as good as the verde, but it turned out nicely nonetheless.  The salsa was already a bit spicy, so I cut the chipotles down to two, although three would have made it good and spicy - just the way I like it!  However, we were making this for a crowd so I needed to keep the heat at a reasonable level.  We used this as a filling for tacos, although it would be equally delicious as a torta.  Served recipe#175635 as a side, which we loved and highly recommend.  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe, Denise!"
439797,59224,2007-07-18,5,Terrific!  My husband loved it.  Nice and spicy.  Very easy to make.  Followed instructions exactly.  It did take the full 8 hours on low before it was ready to be shredded.
358796,59224,2007-10-01,5,"If you like Chipotle's Barbacoa, then you'll love this. Tender, moist, perfectly spiced meat that is not too spicy. Cooked 8 hours on low. Served on corn tortillas with chopped cilantro & white onion. Leftovers are even better. Delicious!"
262312,59224,2007-11-04,5,"excellent, flavorful, and easy to put together!!  i actually used a pork roast, upped it to 4 chipotles and added 2 serrano peppers for extra heat!  we used this to make burritos.  will make many more times!!  thanks denise!!!"
497077,59224,2008-01-21,5,"This roast is WONDERFUL! Followed recipe exactly. I made enchiladas and sandwiches and both were soooo good. The meat is very flavorful and tender. The juice definitely has a kick to it so beware-I used it sparingly but hubby couldn't get enough!!! *Another comment after preparing again, my salsa verde is very, very hot so is adding a lot of the heat that I mentioned above."
47907,59224,2008-02-21,5,"Let me add my 5 stars to this recipe! The meat was so flavorful without being hot and spicy! I made as posted except I subbed picante sauce for the salsa verde (personal preference). I left all the seeds in the chipotles, too. My meat was still somewhat frozen so I put it in early in the morning and cooked on high all day and it came out perfect. We made tacos with the meat. This recipe would be perfect for a crowd. Thanks for posting a keeper!"
74281,59224,2008-03-17,5,This was so delicious and really easy. I have some in the house who can't handle too much spice so I only used 1 Chipotle chile and added about a teaspoon of the adobo sauce. I did use a pork roast because they were on sale and we made burritos and tacos from the meat. I served green chile on the side to smother the burritos in and everyone loved the meat!
140132,59224,2008-06-11,4,"I made this for enchiladias and we loved it.  I could smell it from the start and was practically drooling by the end of the day...lol.  I will make this again, thank you."
231054,59224,2008-08-27,5,"What a wonderful recipe.  It can be used for so many things.  I used the beef chuck roast -- but I can see that a pork butt (shoulder) would be great -- and chicken as well.  My roast was 5 pounds, so I did 1 1/2 the amounts of the recipe.  After it was all said and done, I think I could have just stuck to the original recipe.  I had plenty of ""juice"" -- enough that I was able to put a couple cups of it in the freezer for the next time I make this.  We had tacos last night and they were wonderful.  I can see where it would make great burritos and fajitas -- and sandwiches.  I also cut back on the chilies in the adobo -- mainly because we're having this tomorrow for our two small grandchildren.  The broth was pretty spicy, but once I shredded the meat, it was very mild.  I appreciate having this recipe -- and I can see that many others do as well!"
145352,59224,2008-09-23,5,"Fantastic!!!! We used flour and corn tortillas, pinto and black beans, cheese, shredded cabbage, onions and hot sauce to make killer tacos!"
54678,59224,2009-01-26,5,"Wowser! This turned out fabulous with a ton of heat. I used half moose roast and half pork roast, homemade salsa verde which had its own heat and half a can of chipolte in adobe sauce. Everyone loves it. This was so hot that I had to call the fire dept, well actually that was for another kind of smoke and heat but all turned out well."
252816,59224,2010-06-01,5,"Oh My, but this was good...Followed recipe exactly. Wasnt to hot or spicy for us..Instead of shredding the beef,I ground it and served on tacos. We will not have tacos our old way anymore. From now on when I make this I will double everything  and grind up onions and peppers too that are left in the crockpot..and freeze up meals of taco meat. We will have tacos more often now. Thank U so much for this wonderful recipe.."
76951,59224,2010-07-10,5,Oh my goodness!  This was terrific!  A definite keeper.  I served this on my Recipe #358515 that made into rolls.  I used a mixture of equal parts of mayo and sour cream; then spread on the bottom of the roll along with onion slices and banana pepper slices.  I topped the meat mixture with a sprinkling of shredded yellow cheese then the top of the roll.  An outstanding recipe that I can't wait to serve again.
185446,59224,2010-11-01,5,"Like most other reviewers, we loved this easy, spicy roast.  Made as directed, and wouldn't change anything.  A tasty accompaniment, either as a side dish or dolloped on top of the meat in a flour tortilla, is Cooks4_6's ""Simple Homemade Refried Beans"" (#202416).  Together, these two recipes make a winning combination--thanks Denise for sharing a very versatile meat dish."
637486,59224,2011-01-08,5,"Absolutely fantastic!  I didn't have a roast, but needed to use up some beef tenderloins and steaks in the freezer, so I used about 1 1/2 pounds of each.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  This had such a wonderful flavor and just enough heat without being overpowering.  I made this for enchiladas, and will use the leftovers for tacos.  Thanks for sharing."
126440,59224,2012-04-24,5,"Very easy but with great flavors.  So many ways to use the meat, great ideas."
198154,59224,2014-02-04,3,"While we liked the flavor of this, most of my family found this too spicy.  Of course when using peppers, they vary in size, and therefore the heat will also vary.  It was super easy to throw together and the house smelled fantastic when we got home from work.  If I made this again I would have to play with the ingredients and amounts for my family, trying to keep flavor but decrease the heat."
37449,54257,2005-02-20,5,"This made a very nice tasting meatloaf. I used a tad too much milk(didn't read the review), but the taste was excellent. Thanks Nita!"
126104,54257,2005-11-27,5,"I adore meatloaf, but only good ones.  This is one of the best.

The sauce was perfect for me--not vinegarry at all.  It was totally moist.

I might add green peppers next time, just because I love those.  I'll probably add more onion, because I only had a huge yellow one, and really used just a little of it.

Then, again, I might just do exactly as the recipe calls.  I saw this as I'm eating my second portion.  This was going to be taken to my little lady for dinner, but I may be making her one tomorrow.  Not sure there'll be any of this one left."
184723,54257,2005-12-13,5,"Okay, this was GOOD.  My husband doesn't really care for meatloaf and asked to bring it to work today as well!  Note... I did saute the onions beforehand or I would have gotten complaints.  Thanks for the great recipe!





"
44383,54257,2005-12-17,1,I don't understand it. All these rave reviews and I was left disappointed yet again by another tasteless meatloaf that crumbled as soon as you point a knife at it. I followed the recipe exactly.DH said it tasted okay and that's all that really matters but I thought it had very little taste at all and it will be impossible to use for sandwiches tomorrow. Sorry to say I won't be repeating this one.
230557,54257,2006-01-19,3,"Average tasting meatloaf to my family.  Made per directions using 1/2C half & half and the recommended addition of Kitchen Bouquet.  In our opinion there was not much flavor and the texture was way off, very loose.  The sauce was okay but again not much to our liking.  Meatloaf recipes are just one of those mysterious things - you either really like it or don't, and everyone's tastes are different.  Thank you for giving our family something different to try. "
56087,54257,2006-01-30,3,"This was ok, held together nicely but honestly was lacking in flavor.  Was more like an onion burger rather than meatloaf."
265954,54257,2006-02-24,5,Absolutely delicious.  Quick and simple to make. Thank you so much for this recipe!
32058,54257,2006-03-29,5,"We loved this!  I used sweetened condensed milk and only about 1/3 cup after reading some reviews.  I thi8nk I'll use as directed next time for even moister meatloaf!  Very good!  I drained the fat after baking and then used remaining sauce as a ""gravy"" after doubling batch of sauce.  YUMMY! Definite keeper in our house!"
278113,54257,2006-05-07,5,"No doubt the best meatloaf I have ever eaten. Even my son, who grumbles that he HATES meatloaf, tore through his portion tonight without one complaint...now THAT is good meatloaf!! This will replace my ""other"" recipe, and will be made often in our home. Thanks for  sharing!! "
229850,54257,2006-05-23,5,"Wonderful meatloaf. It was deliciously different. I was sciptical, it didn't seem there was much to it, I was wrong, there was just enough. I did make the meat mixture early this morning to let the flavors blend as my sister taught me. But I will admit, I thought mix with what onions? The sauce was a little tangy when I tasted it, I thought oh no too much cider vinegar, but you know what, marvelous.Thankyou for great addition."
97579,54257,2006-08-15,4,This had a nice taste but there was a lot of grease around my meat.  I used ground round and maybe I'll try the sirloin next time.
173579,54257,2006-08-31,5,This was fantastic!  One of the best meatloaves that I have ever had.  I did only add 1/4 cup of the milk.  It baked up nice.  Will make this many more times I'm sure.  Thanks for posting.
357358,54257,2006-10-15,5,"Hubby says this is a keeper! Substituted bread crumbs for the slice of bread, but it was wonderful anyway. Only problem I had was that I did not make enough. Will double it next time. Thanks for sharing."
89831,54257,2006-10-28,2,"Sorry for the low review I really wanted to like this recipe, based on all the 5 star reviews I really cannot understand what all the hype is about this recipe! it is totally lacking in flavor and in texture, the sauce on top is like eating jelly or jam, even with added fresh garlic this recipe was a total dissapointment for my family and ended up by tossing it away after having only a few bites. I think will stick to my own recipe, oh well we all have different tastes, but thank you anyway...Kittencal"
124190,54257,2006-11-09,5,"So, so good! I didn't use the sauce recipe, because I have one of my own that I love. This was the first time I'd ever used bread instead of crackers or breadcrumbs. What a difference! I doubled the recipe and got four mini-loaves. Thanks for posting!!!"
180090,54257,2007-01-06,4,"This meatloaf was very good! It was my first time making meatloaf. I followed the recipe exactly. I used 93% lean ground beef and there was grease/liquid all around the meat after baking, so I'm not sure if that is normal when making meatloaf. The onions were slightly crunchy, so I might saute them next time before adding. The sauce was tangy, which gave the meat nice flavor. The meat did fall apart easily when serving, but it was tasty and moist. Thanks for posting this!"
207176,54257,2006-11-29,5,"This IS a winner! Thank you! I pondered making this so many times. I never made a meatloaf with a glaze before.  It was so great!  Used 1 1/2 tbsp. Splenda brown sugar, 3/4 cup plain bread crumbs for the bread and 1/2-1/4 cup light cream.I even browned the onions in a pan sprayed with cooking oil before adding them to the meat. I read every review before making this, all 15 pages! I was concerned about the texture but mine was terrific.  After it cooked for the required time, I drained the fat and let it cool a bit. It sliced  beautifully.  My 2 sons (13 and 10) and I polished this off except- for a sliver of slice that we saved for DH to taste!  DH was the reason for the Splenda but this isnt' a good choice for a diabetic with the crumbs and all the the ketchup!  My 13 year old had 3 slices and the 10 year old had 2 slices and that's a very good thing!  While we like the glaze sauce on top, we only liked eating a touch of it since it is very sweet, tangy and powerful. The taste of the meatloaf was great alone too."
359220,54257,2006-12-03,5,"Truly extraordinary!  This made meatloaf lovers of me and my DH.  I can't decide what I like best, the tangy glaze or the meatloaf.  I wish it were a little more firm and I definitely will make sure to use a leaner beef to cut down on grease.  This makes great leftovers too!"
394077,54257,2006-12-22,5,"Excellent recipe.  Didn't need to change a thing.   My meatloaf recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  I love it that it is moist and tasty and easy to make.  I used evaporated milk.  Is that the same as sweet milk?  Anyway, it is The best!"
40961,54257,2006-12-24,5,"I want to give this many more than 5 stars because if you asked me yesterday, ""do you like meatloaf?"" I would have said ""no"". Today I made this using the recipe and other's suggestions. I used 1/4 cup of evaporated milk, 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and the rest followed exactly. I also baked it in a 9 inch pie tin and that was the best idea. It took 1 hour. I wish we had this recipe growing up! Thanks for sharing a winner. I can't wait to have it for sandwhiches tomorrow. Delicious!!!"
125640,54257,2007-01-04,2,"The first time I tried this I wasn't a fan. I made it exactly as directed, except for the sauce (the sauce I tried at 2 tbsp each vinegar & brown sugar and it was already too vinegary for us so I added a bit more ketchup and only put a little of the sauce on top). I thought the taste of the meat loaf itself was just sort of average (kind of bland and tomatoey); for all the rave reviews, I was expecting something exceptional. The texture wasn't just moist, it was loose to the point of falling apart. You couldn't cut a slice and pull it out of the pan in the less than about 4 little pieces. But, I decided to give this another try with a few modifications. This time I used elk instead of beef (the flavor was better and no problems with being to dry, but we have fat added to ours), I sauteed the onion before adding it and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and an extra 1/4 tsp salt and I cut the half-&-half back to 1/4 cup. For the sauce I used 2 tbsp brown sugar, only 1 tbsp of vinegar and added 1 tbsp prepared mustard with the 1/2 cup ketchup. I thought overall the taste was much improved and the texture was still a little loose, but not unreasonably so. I would make it again with my changes except that both times this meatloaf really messed with my stomach. I don't usually have a problem with any of the ingredients involved, so I'm thinking maybe it's the combination of cream and vinegar as that's an unusual combo for me. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway though."
329638,54257,2007-02-16,5,"My new meatloaf recipe.  DH usually lets me make meatloaf once a year, but since I found this 6 weeks ago we've had it 4 times without complaint!  I sometimes switch the ketchup with BBQ sauce.  And the sauce on top is excellent!  Thanks for sharing!"
373817,54257,2007-03-05,5,"This is the best meatloaf that I have ever made! I added green peppers and fresh garlic, and I used regular milk. Everyone is right...the topping is delicious! I also cooked mine in the 9 inch pie pan. It was done in an hour and 15 minutes exactly! It smelled SO good while it was cooking, too!! Thanks for the delicious recipe!"
58836,54257,2007-03-14,4,"Made Sunday for lunch and had company over.  It was pretty good.  I used crackers in place of the bread and bbq sauce for the ketchup, no vinegar due to allergies and it was all gone.  Thanks, I'm sure I will make again."
74652,54257,2007-03-29,2,I am reviewing this again because last time I did not add the milk and it came out great and sliced nicely.  This time it just completely fell apart with the addition of milk. We were dissapointed with this for dinner.  I might try it agin with some adjustments.  Sorry
140132,54257,2007-04-04,5,I have made this a couple of times already and each time it turns out wonderful.  I am one who cannot make a meatloaf that can be sliced????  But with this recipe it was perfect.  Thank you for a great tasting meatloaf that doesn't crumble under my knife...lol.  The flavor was exactly what we look for in a meat loaf.
316717,54257,2007-06-27,5,followed everything except i added a little bit of garlic powder and worceshire sauce. used regular milk and put in a little more than 1/4 cup. came out DELICIOUS! whole family and i LOVED it. even our picky kids. our 1 year old kept eating and eating. and my VERY picky husband loved it. thank you for sharing a delicious recipe!
383346,54257,2007-07-02,5,I used 2 lbs of ground beef and regular milk (1/2 cup).  I had to cook it for about 1 hour and 30 minutes cause I wasn't sure it was cooked through.  It's delicious.  Thanks :)
158086,54257,2007-07-12,5,This was a big hit at my house....It was wolfed down so I know it is a keeper....hardly any left for sandwiches the next day...
50969,54257,2007-09-03,4,"The only time I get to eat meatloaf is when SO goes out of town,so tonight I chose this recipe.I made the meatloaf as directed,only using 1/2 cup of milk.If I make this again I think I will use 2/3 cup,because using the lesser amount made it just a tad dry.As for the sauce,I cut the vinegar down to 2 tablespoons,next time I'll use just 1 1/2 tablespoons.As for the brown sugar,and ketchup I left those amounts the same.Served with Recipe#30366,Recipe#65340,and mixed veggies.Thanks for posting,""Keep Smiling:)"""
13483,54257,2007-10-17,5,KISS is the way to go.  Keep it Simple.  This is just a classic recipe that almost everyone will enjoy.  I made it for a small potluck and served it cold.  Between the 8 of us it was all gone shortly after being put out.  Doesn't pay to mess with a clasic and this is one.Thanks for the post Nita
579298,54257,2007-11-30,3,"Meatloaf has never been a favorite of mine - so I am always searching for something spectacular. This recipe was good, but not great - however the sauce is awesome! I really think that adding the sweet milk or half-and-half is a five star technique for making a moist and fluffy meatloaf. I never would have thought of that one!"
111291,54257,2008-01-09,4,"Nice recipe.  Used 1/3 c. evaporated milk and half and half mixture. Cooked the onions first and added one clove garlic;  I didn't have Kitchen BouquetÂ® so I added some soy sauce.  The topping sauce was a little sweeter than I prefer, so I will use only 2 Tbs. brown sugar the next time.  Thanks for posting."
222970,54257,2008-01-14,5,"Finally, what a meatloaf should be. I cooked until a meat thermometer read 170 degrees fahrenheit.

I doubled it and made two loaf pans and one pan of 12 mini meatloafs in a muffin tin. I liked the muffin tin meatloaf better.

We also wished that I had doubled the sauce.

P.S. I used skim milk."
218535,54257,2008-03-17,4,Very good. I made the extra serving of sauce to serve with the dish. UPDATE: I recently tried Recipe #15027 which I think is a better meatloaf.
286851,54257,2008-04-28,4,"I thought this was a good meatloaf, and I liked that the sauce was different than the normal ketchup-only topping. I used 4 TBSP. dark brown sugar in the sauce, and my husband said the sauce was a little too sweet for him--I may cut back on that next time. I also used lower-fat 90% fat ground beef (against the recipe author's suggestion)-- and it worked out just fine. Still full of flavor, with less fat. Thanks for sharing."
191533,54257,2008-06-12,1,"Sorry, these meatloaf-haters aren't converted. I haven't had meatloaf in over 4 years... but I still don't like it.  Also thought the sauce is too sour. So if you already dislike meatloaf, be wary..."
666723,54257,2008-09-11,5,5 Million stars!!  I have tried so many meatloaf recipes and there is always a problem.  Usually they are mushy and never seem to get solid enough for my preference.  This was really easy to make.  I didn't have an onion on hand but I did use a sweet bell pepper and that was a great choice.  Also I just used regular milk but not as much as called for.  The sauce is truly wonderful even though it seems so simple.  I deeply regret not making more for dipping!!  Mine was perfect at 1 hour 10 minutes.  It did produce a lot of grease but I just poured that out and had a perfect meatloaf!  Will only make this recipe from now on...
80998,54257,2008-09-21,5,"We really enjoyed this meatloaf.  I will never use a seasoning packet again.  I didn't have whole milk, so used fat free.  I added some bread crumbs as it was not forming well, but the end result was great.  Thanks."
177933,54257,2008-10-17,5,"LOVE this meatloaf, so dense and moist...perfect in every way.  I liked the sauce, but think I like a little less vinegar next time.  Something I did differently was to pour one batch of the sauce on top at the beginning as posted, but then 30 minutes before it was done I pulled the meatloaf out and poured off all of the fat and liquid.  Then I poured a second batch of sauce around the loaf for the last 30 minutes of cooking.  We had just the right amount of sauce, my husband raved!  And, he just had a meatloaf sandwich for lunch...yum!"
529278,54257,2008-10-17,4,"Had a good flavor, for meat loaf.  I have actually made tasteless meatloaf before.  Not sure how.  Anyway, we didn't have onion, so I gave it a generous covering of onion powder, used cracker crumbs instead of bread, and had to substitute tomato sauce for some of the ketchup.  I'm still not sure how I feel about the sauce, but I used all 4 tablespoons of dark brown sugar, and only 3 of vinegar.  It was still plenty tangy.  I won't do meatloaf the old way anymore.  Also, we use 90% lean ground beef, so it was a bit drier than ideal, but still good."
126440,54257,2008-12-13,5,"Not that you need another rating, but this is a great recipe.  I have made it a couple times and it is very easy.  Love the sauce! Served it with baked potatoes and roasted green beans."
38643,54257,2008-12-19,5,I loved the smell of this while it was cooking.  The meatloaf was moist and flavorful with a good texture.
189475,54257,2009-01-05,5,"I thought this recipe was great. The only thing I did differently was I put half of the meatloaf mixture into the dish, covered it with mozzarella cheese and then covered that with the other half of the meatloaf mixture. My mom always made meatloaf that way and I love it. The taste of the sauce was very strong because of the apple cider vinegar but I liked it anyways. I will definitely be making this again."
227607,54257,2009-01-16,4,The meatloaf itself was really good.  We thought that the sauce was too vinegary.  The vinegar came across very strong.  I will make it again but probably just use my normal ketchup sauce.
333017,54257,2009-02-10,3,"I am not a big fan of meatloaf because the meat is cooking in all that fat...but this recipe got so many good hits that I had to try it!  I made this with a mix of beef, pork and veal.  While cooking, there was a milky fat substance that was pooling around the top of the loaf that was not appealing to me.  I skimmed off the grease and ended up taking some of the sauce with it, (my bad!!).  Some changes that I made:  I added chili sauce to the base and used 3 T of brown sugar in the sauce.  After the loaf was finished cooking, I let it set for 10 minutes on the counter and drained the grease.  My family enjoyed the meatloaf and even asked for a repeat...but I would make some changes first.  I would cook the loaf without the sauce and de-grease through the cooking time.  I would add the sauce towards the end of the cooking period.  There was alot of sauce that just pooled on the top of the loaf, so next time, I would cut down on the sauce.  I do agree (with other comments) that the onion should be sauteed and I would add minced garlic to the mix.  Thanks Nita for sharing your recipe!"
185926,54257,2009-02-11,5,"I've made this a couple of times now and my whole family loves it.  The 2nd time, I used half ground chuck and half ground chicken.  That was yummy too.  Thank you."
146047,54257,2009-03-02,5,"Awesome meatloaf! I used my microplane grater on the onion (and on a clove of garlic) so no complaints about chunks of onion and garlic being uncooked. There was more sauce than needed-- You could easily halve it and there'd still be plenty (including some to heat up and serve on the side). I didn't have apple cider vinegar so used red wine vinegar instead. Cooking it freeform on a broiler pan (so the grease can drip through) worked well for us. All in all, a 5-star dish for sure. Fantastic with mashed potatoes, gravy, and broccoli. Thanks for posting!"
135887,54257,2009-03-04,4,"This was really good. I mixed it up the night before and acutally forgot to put the sauce on. It was still great. Next time I'll do it right:)
Update - made this correctly this time by adding the sauce.  We all liked it better without the sauce.  For one thing, it's VERY sweet and for another thing, about half of it ended up in the pan.  So - if you do make the sauce, maybe cut the sauce recipe in half."
92816,54257,2009-03-15,5,"This deserves more than 5 stars,it is amazing!I made a few slight changes.Along with the ketchup(3 Tbsp) in the meatloaf itself I also added a tbsp of Montana's Apple Butter BBQ Sauce(I love that stuff).I also added a clove of garlic and reduced the milk to 1/4 cup.
For the sauce I used 3 tbsp of white vinegar and 3 tbsp of brown sugar,along with the ketchup.This is my new meatloaf recipe.I can't say enough good things about it.Thanks so much for posting it."
362983,54257,2009-04-10,5,"Without a doubt, this is my favourite meatloaf recipe! Now that I've made this a few times, I've learned a few tweaks to get it just right for me. I always sautee the onions beforehand, and add some minced garlic to the pan as well. No one here likes crunchy onions in their meatloaf! I use at most, 1/4 cup of milk only, maybe a touch less. Using less definitely helps the loaf hold its shape better, otherwise I end up with a mushy (though still tasty) meatloaf. It comes out fine with a lower fat milk as well, like 2% or skim; I haven't noticed any difference. For the sauce, instead of 1/2 cup of ketchup, I use 1/4 ketchup plus 1/4 of my favourite BBQ sauce. Plus I usually use 2 TB of brown sugar since I prefer a less sweet sauce. I've also used spicy ketchup for a nice kick, or a shot or two of hot sauce. Definitely my favourite meatloaf and everyone always comes back for seconds (or thirds!) Thanks!! :)"
81611,54257,2009-06-08,5,"Even better the 2nd time. I used 1/2 buffalo, 1/2 gr beef. The sauce on top is SO succulent. My kids GOBBLED it (again). This will be a regular! UPDATE: almost 6 years later and this is STILL my most regular 'zaar recipe! Just want you to know we still love it!"
318235,54257,2009-06-30,3,I liked this but it was a little too vinegar-y for me. Thank you for the recipe.
377039,54257,2009-08-04,4,"The sauce was five stars; the meatloaf itself was three. I'll compromise with a rating of four.  I will definitely use the sauce again, but I'll use my own meatloaf recipe. I'll probably try the sauce on other meats, too."
1365025,54257,2009-10-16,4,Very good. The meatloaf was nice and moist using 1/4 cup milk. The sauce was very different but tasty. I used the 4 Tbs. of brown sugar as one reader suggested but it was way to sweet. Next time I'll cut it down to 2 or 2 1/2 Tbs. and maybe cut the vinegar down to 3 Tbs. All in all a very nice flavorful meatloaf.
637486,54257,2009-12-31,4,The only reason I am giving this a 4 is because I wish I had made extra sauce to go on top.  I didn't want to use the sauce that had collected in the pan because it had all the fat from the meat in it.  I thought that this meatloaf had a fabulous flavor and the glaze on top was wonderful....just wish there was more!
1122161,54257,2010-02-02,5,"I never really tasted a good meatloaf until now! This was soo tasty, and simple to make I was really surprised! I made exactly as directed, except I grinded two slices of bread in the food processor to make about a cup and a half of crumbs. I used the maximum in sugar for the sauce. I felt that it really had plenty of sauce and really didn't need to serve additional. Thanks for posting this great recipe!"
810787,54257,2010-02-03,5,My husband really loved this and thought it had a lot of flavor. He gave it 5 stars. For me...it was a little too sweet. I guess I'm a plain ketchup with meatloaf kind of girl. I gave it 4 stars and since there aren't 1/2's he won the vote.
104295,54257,2010-02-06,5,"Being review 674, there isn't a lot left to say.  But my kids loved this and said it was the best they had ever had.  I used low fat turkey and 3 tbsp. of brown sugar.  A good comfort meal alongside scalloped potatoes and green beans, with the snow falling down outside."
178742,54257,2010-02-14,4,Made it for dinner last Sunday and we really enjoyed it. Served with mash potatoes and steamed veggies. Will make this again!
142464,54257,2010-03-04,5,"My hubby & I both like a good meatloaf and over the years I have acquired different recipes and enjoyed them all.  Yours has now been added to that list.  Tasted fantastic and the sauce went great over mashed potatoes.
Truly a delicious meatloaf which will be made on a regular basis in this household.  Let me add my thanks along with the other 698 reviewers!!"
1133190,54257,2010-08-05,4,"As far as meatloaf goes, this was a pretty good recipe.  My husband, a meatloaf connoisseur of sorts (sadly) enjoyed it very much.  The four star rating is due to the fact that we both have had/made meatloaf recipes before that we liked more.  I also felt like my meatloaf was kind of flat compared to other recipes I've made."
169969,54257,2011-01-13,0,"This is a great meatloaf recipe. Our entire family loved it! I was surprised at the amount of liquid that I poured out of the pan after it cooked. The meat seemed a little mushy from the 1/2 cup of half and half, but the meat had plenty of texture after it cooked and I am glad I did not add more meat to the mixture. I cooked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes and it sat on the stovetop for about 15 minutes before I sliced it. Had to be a bit careful slicing, but did get nice slices. The leftovers made awesome meatloaf sandwiches! Update: Doubled the recipe tonight and it was still wonderful! 1/13/11 Made a double batch again today! So yummy!"
789516,54257,2011-03-19,5,perfect.
55578,54257,2011-04-11,5,Great!  I used skim milk which worked fine. I would def double the sauce next time and maybe sweat the onions a bit before adding them to the meat mixture.  Tx for the recipe.
937635,54257,2011-04-25,5,"The sauce was a 5-star for sure! I was worried it would be too vinegary after reading some of the reviews and smelling the sauce, but it turns out perfectly. (I even added slightly less than the whole batch of sauce, but would add all of it next time). I think the meatloaf itself is kind of boring, but it's easy and uses things I always have on hand. I think it needs garlic and some spices and then it will be perfect. Thanks!"
400708,54257,2011-06-30,5,"Review #848, so why bother - because after reading all the reviews I HAD to try this for myself and I must say all the reviews are well earned.  Yes Virginia, this is truly one this is truly one great meatloaf!  I made a few minor changes but I think it only added to the taste.  Took another reviewers advise and carmilized the onions (adding celery and garlic to them) prior to adding to the mix, added 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke as we love that smoky flavor and 1 tablespoon of worchester sauce for flavor.  Added another 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke to the sauce and then baked as directed in one of those special meatloaf pans that has 2 layers and drains off the grease.  The end result was a lovely meatloaf that was firm when cutting and tasted awesome, took your advise and made extra sauce to use for dipping on the side.  YUM!!  Served with homemade potatoe chips and sesame spinach with a glass of Washington's fine red wine.  Lovely."
22015,54257,2011-08-27,5,I normally use chili sauce on top of mine but was out so I used my meat mixture and your topping.  It was delicious.  I love that sweet tangy flavor from the mixture of brown sugar and vinegar.  Plus it glazed the meatloaf nicely.  Thanks for the new option for my meatloaf.
29782,54257,2011-09-08,5,This is a delicious and easy recipe.  I didn't have any apple cider vinegar so I used Hunt's Hickory Smoked BBQ sauce and added the rest of the sauce mix to it.  Placed on top of meatloaf and baked as directed.  It turned out great!  Hubby said it was the best meatloaf that I've made in awhile.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
456858,54257,2011-09-26,1,I didn't care for the taste of this.
2041603,54257,2011-10-25,5,I never ate meatloaf growing up but this recipe rocks. I made a double loaf for family and they almost ate the whole thing!
133174,54257,2012-10-28,5,"Let me add my rating to the 942 already present.  Hard to believe that I haven't tried this before now.  This is a very basic meatloaf that reminds me much of what my mother made when I was little.  As one reviewer suggested I will be making this again as using mini-loaf pans.  This made a wonderful meal served with sauteed yellow squash, Recipe #119430 and cornbread muffins."
138429,54257,2012-11-21,5,Excellent meatloaf. Nothing that I can add that has not already been said.Recipe now in my favorites file. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.
847160,54257,2012-12-06,4,Good meatloaf but i wont make the sauce again
307214,54257,2013-10-01,5,Really yummy ...
242484,54257,2014-01-17,5,"I have made this so many times, I couldn&#039;t count!  It is just the best recipe...period!  Look no further!"
489552,54257,2014-01-18,5,"I can&#039;t believe I have not reviewed this recipe yet!  I have made this recipe about 12 times now.  Actually it is the only meatloaf recipe I make.  I use 2 lbs of lean ground beef, 2 slices of bread and 1/2 cup of milk.  Perfect every time.  We love it!  I always double up on the sauce because we like to use it on top of the mash potatoes I server it with.  By far the BEST and a KEEPER.  tyvm"
37779,54257,2014-04-06,4,"The flavor of the meatloaf was great. A little looser than we like, it did not hold it&#039;s shape when sliced (I used the smaller amount of milk). May add extra bread crumbs next time. The sauce was slightly too vinegary for out taste. Would reduce vinegar by at least 1 tablespoon. Overall, a good meatloaf, just needs a few tweaks for our preference."
768828,54257,2014-04-08,5,"This is the best meatloaf I&#039;ve ever made. It will be my go to recipe from now on.  I&#039;ve used something similar to the sauce recipe but like it with the vinegar now. Thanks so much for the great recipe.  Oh, I did saute the onions with a clove of garlic before adding to the meat and also added 1 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce.  Yummy."
7108,54257,2014-09-09,5,"Very good!  I had a little over 1 1/2 lb of ground meatloaf mix.  Added egg, pepper, small diced onion, ketchup. Instead of the bread, I added 2 nice sized handful of StoveTop stuffing and only added 1/3 cup of milk.  Sprinkled a little sea salt over the top as well as a very small sprinkle of a Garlic Garlic seasoning I had on hand.  Cooked at 375 for 1 hour then for another 10 to 12 min at 425 (because I added biscuits to oven to be cooked at higher temp).  I did not add the topping, as we don&#039;t like our meatloaf too sweet and it already had ketchup inside and I like to serve with brown gravy, which I did.  Very much enjoyed by my 14 y/o son and myself.  Not too salty, moist inside, a little browned on the top and just enough of every ingredient for a flavorful meatloaf...just the way we like it.  Thanks for posting, will make again!"
222055,54257,2014-10-30,5,"Oh My! We loved this because we loved the sauce. I do believe you must love the sauce for this to be a 5 star recipe to you. After going through all the reviews, I started to saute the onions or make some additions- Glad I didn&#039;t, you don&#039;t need to. If you &quot;finely&quot; chop the onions as stated, they work fine. If you cover the &quot;top and sides&quot; of your meatloaf with the sauce as stated, you don&#039;t need to add any spices to your meatloaf because the sauce is the maker of this meatloaf. Again- We Loved It!!! Thank you Nita!!!"
1581225,54257,2014-11-17,4,This was a good first meatloaf for me. I too added 1 tbs Worcestershire as a replacement for 1tbs of the vinegar in the sauce. I also added a couple of garlic cloves and sauted with the onions before adding to the meat mixture and added a teaspoon of all purpose seasoning. It came out very tasty.
98919,54257,2015-02-12,5,Nice and moist. Taste like my mom&#039;s used to. Thanks for posting!
315055,54257,2017-02-04,3,"The meatloaf itself is very good, but the sauce wasn't. The acv is too strong, and my kids refused to eat it."
124190,136589,2005-09-27,5,"Utterly and amazingly delicious. I could not be happier right now! I did substitute half the oil with applesauce. It worked just fine for me. One thing not to do though, is sub the cream for skim milk. I didn't have any cream, so I used milk, and it did not work well. I'm glad I found this recipe now, and I don't have to look for any more! Great recipe, thanks for posting!"
13796,136589,2006-09-16,5,I made this today along with a chocolate cake. This is very delicious and we thought it didn't need the topping. The cake alone is moist and delicious. It's sweet enough without the topping. Next time I think a cream cheese icing might work a little better for me. The cake is a keeper! Thanks..
58836,136589,2006-09-22,4,This was pretty good.  The caramel sauce made it seem like it wasn't done in the middle but it also made it take very very good.  Thanks
203325,136589,2006-10-02,4,The photo by MarieAlice is what enticed me to make this cake.  The cake was good but I will make double the sauce next time.
251626,136589,2006-11-15,5,"So delicious. Also, so easy for a cake that tastes so good. It seemed to get even better after a day. Loved It!"
50969,136589,2007-01-18,5,"I had some apples that I wanted to use up,So I looked through my dessert cookbook and found this one.As Chef Mizzy had done I cut the recipe in half and used two eggs.My SO thought it had the right amount of sweetness( he must have,he had two pieces :) ) but to me it was just a little too sweet,must have been the glaze,but overall it was very moist and tasty.Thank you for posting a very good recipe.UPDATE:1-18-2007
After letting this wonderful cake set overnight,I ate another piece and it seemed to taste less sweet.So,that's why I changed the rating from a 4 to a 5 star rating.If you make this recipe,may I suggest making it the day before you need it to let the magnificent(sp)flavors come together."
251917,136589,2007-01-29,5,"There are no words - this cake is insanely good!! Moist, flavorful - the caramel sauce makes a bit of a crisp topping once it cools - delicious! I made this for a family dinner and I had to print the recipe off for everyone! It definitely lives up to it's name!"
135887,136589,2007-03-13,4,Very easy to make and even easier to eat!!  We all love it!  Thanks for sharing
173579,136589,2007-03-27,5,This was very good but very rich.  Will be making this again I'm sure.  Thanks for posting.
359220,136589,2007-04-08,5,"I have to say that I did not taste this cake (too many Easter desserts), but it got several comments and a request for the recipe from a man, no less!!  Very easy to throw together, I used 3 large gala apples for the 3 cups of apple.  Mine baked through in about 35 minutes.  I let the cake cool, covered tightly and waited to top it with the sauce until right before serving..Thanks for posting."
329638,136589,2007-04-23,5,"Definitely the best apple cake! Based on other reviews I used half applesauce and half oil.  Didn't have any apple juice so used the applesauce for that, too.  Used half cinnamon sugar and half vanilla sugar that I had stashed in the cupboard.  I like bigger chunks of apples, so I didn't worry about chopping them too fine. I used evaporated milk for the heavy cream. Not 10 minutes after I had shown DH the cake when he came home from work and there is a 2x2 piece missing (he is stealing one bite at a time and can't leave it alone!).
Very yummy.  Thanks for sharing!"
97579,136589,2007-06-12,3,"I thought the cake was good.  I did like that the cake was very dense and moist, but I felt that it was just a bit bland.  The carmel sauce definately helped with the taste.  If I were to make it again, I think I would maybe add some cinnamon in the batter."
394077,136589,2007-07-28,5,"Very good. Moist, soft and nice flavor.   Here are the changes I made: I didn't have any apple juice, so I used buttermilk.  Instead of chopping up the apples,  I grated them. I baked these as cupcakes at 350 for 25 minutes. I also skipped the caramel sauce because my family doesn't like too sweet desert.  A keeper.  Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe."
80998,136589,2007-08-22,5,"Wow!  Loved this cake!  Can I just say...DO NOT SKIP TEH DRIZZLE TOPPING!  I thought about skipping it because I found I didn't have any whipping cream.  I discovered however that I had carmel flavored coffee cream, so I used it.  I am sure it added a bit of a different flavor than having regular cream would of, but it still tasted great.  When I make it again with real cream I will have to see what taste better.  This is an outstanding recipe that I will make again and again.  Only 31 years of cooking here, but best apple cake I have ever had!"
774665,136589,2008-08-23,5,"This is good but VERY sweet. My husband isn't a huge fan of overly sweet things so I probably won't make it again but I'm sure the guys at work will devour it, so I'm sending the rest with him on Monday. I'd eat it myself but I'm being good."
158086,136589,2007-10-09,5,"What a fabulous recipe this is!  I made it with splenda for baking and splenda blend brown sugar to cut down on the sugar content, and it turned out great...sure is yummy when it is still warm from the oven!"
8688,136589,2007-10-17,5,"I followed Rose of Sharon's simple instructions to the letter for wonderfully delicious results!  I did however poke several holes with a wooden skewer so the sauce could seep into the cake.  I have used this method on other cakes and it provides a really nice moist texture with the flavor evenly distributed throughout the cake.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, Rose of Sharon!"
74281,136589,2007-11-12,4,"We all thought this cake was really good with some of the suggestions from the reviews. I used 1/2 of the oil with 1 cup of cinnamon applesauce. I also added 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry mix, I peeled the apples and did not add the nuts. I doubled the sauce recipe but even doubled the cake didn't look like MarieAlice's beautiful picture. I think next time I would still double the sauce but save some to spoon warm over each piece of cake."
222564,136589,2008-01-03,5,"Loved it, moist and very appley and caramelly."
331557,136589,2008-02-09,4,This was a fantastic cake that I will make again.  I did take another reviewers suggestion and used 1/4 cup apple juice and 1/4 cup rye and it was a nice addition and gave the cake some additional depth.  I left everything else the same and served with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for posting!
140132,136589,2008-02-22,5,We loved the cake.  It reminded me of the cake my g'ma used to make.  DH loved the sauce I drizzled over.  Thank you for an old fashioned recipe from my childhood.    Stephanie
60260,136589,2008-10-19,5,"I followed a few another's option of replacing half the oil with applesauce and I added cinnamon because I love cinnamon with my apples.  I overbaked mine just a bit and with less oil you have to be carefull.  I didn't follow directions well and added the caramel sauce to a hot cake but it soaked in nicely and tasted great.  My family said it needed more sauce, so the next day I made a 2nd batch of sauce to pour over the cake - then is was a bit too sweet.  So next time I will bake a few minutes less, let the cake completely cool and add the caramel sauce at the right time.  I had some personal flubs with this cake but we all still give it a thumbs up and 5 star!"
32058,136589,2008-10-24,5,"This was great for a potluck or for a fall dessert.  Really anytime.  The apples were not as prevelant as I thought they would be, but it was good nonetheless.  Didn't stop me from eating bite after bite after bite!  The glaze is what makes it special.   I agree with ilovecuppycakes that it is more like a bread.  maybe in my mind I envison a dense APPLE, but this is not that type of cake.  Would make again and proudly serve to company. (I did think adding cinnamon might be nice while mixing this, but stuck to the recipe.  I think this it is dandy just as written.)  TY for posting."
242484,136589,2008-11-04,3,Just okay for me.
182624,136589,2008-11-07,5,"I'm not much for apple desserts, but DH loves them so I thought I'd give this one a shot. It's fantastic!! The sauce really makes it; I plan on doubling it next time. Thanks for sharing your great recipe, Rose!  EDIT:  After enjoying this cake again the next day, I don't plan on doubling the sauce anymore.  The sauce soaks into the cake and flavors it perfectly.  I never thought I'd see the day when an apple dessert was one of my all time favorites!  YUM!!!"
520150,136589,2009-05-06,5,I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon & replaced 1/2 of the oil with apple sauce.  This was a big hit.  Shared with friends & everyone enjoyed it.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!
231054,136589,2009-05-20,5,Well this recipe is appropriately titled!!!!  We really enjoyed this.  I did need the entire 50 minutes baking time -- and perhaps could have added another 3 or 5 minutes.  I also added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  The glaze is wonderful.
8629,136589,2009-09-20,5,"This cake has been on my to-do list for years, ever since I saw chef MarieAlice's picture of the cake.  I made the cake today with Cortland apples.  This cake lived up to all of my expectations. I'm glad I had the suggestions of other chefs to poke holes all over the cake with a tooth pick before pouring the sauce over it.  I spread about half of the glaze over the warm cake, waited about 15 minutes for the glaze to set and be absorbed and then spread the remaining glaze over the cake.  This is truly a fantastic cake."
226863,136589,2010-02-28,5,"Very moist cake.  I substituted pecans, because that is what I had on hand.  I also used half applesauce and half oil.  LOVED the glaze.  Like other reviewers, I think it would be great over ice cream!"
839492,136589,2010-06-16,4,"I reduced the sugar in the cake by 1/2c. and was tempted to reduce the sugar in the glaze by the same amount(wish I had). This cake is very good & moist (I also added cinnamon & nutmeg per other's suggestions). It is very, very sweet. I think the glaze was improved with the addition of a 1/2t. of vanilla extract. If I make again, I will reduce the sugar more. Thanks for sharing."
64203,136589,2013-08-22,5,The title of this cake as the BEST apple cake is right on! I can&#039;t believe how flavorful it is without the addition of any spices. Especially delicious warm out of the oven!
36944,73033,2006-03-21,5,"This is fast, easy and makes a delicious pan of creamy and moist scrambled eggs.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Sharon!"
8629,73033,2006-03-30,5,"Really, really great. As is often said about a Paula Deen recipe, ""A definate keeper""!"
29782,73033,2007-01-30,5,"Very simple and easy recipe! I only made for 1 serving since it is just me here this morning. I used Colby-Monterey Jack cheese blend since this was what I had on hand here. Turned out delicious, next time I will use half and half milk in place of water for more of a richer taste.
Thanks for sharing one of Paula Deen's delicious recipes! :)"
53932,73033,2007-01-31,5,"These are really good scrambled eggs and I usually do not like scrambled eggs.  When you add all that good stuff, the eggs just taste better.  Thank you!"
149363,73033,2007-02-01,5,"Mmmmmm.....delicious eggs Sharon!
Moist and fluffy, simple to prepare with lots of flavour. Thanks for sharing!"
39835,73033,2007-02-03,5,Delicious cheesy eggs which we enjoyed! I was out of sour cream so used non-fat plain yogurt and medium cheddar cheese. We also only used six eggs for delicious scrambled eggs for just the two of us. Thanks for sharing this keeper!
176615,73033,2007-02-03,5,"So good! You won't believe the difference a little sour cream makes. Light, fluffy, and cheesy. I used reduced fat sharp cheddar. Served these for dinner with Sharon's recipe #101266, bacon, and mixed fruit. My son LOVED these! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
50969,73033,2007-02-11,5,"I just can't believe that an addition of sour cream would make simple scrambled eggs something special.Since only two of us were eating our eggs scrambled, I cut the recipe in half and used about a 1/2 cup of shredded sharp chedder cheese.Normally I don't like eggs in any form,but these were very good.This recipe will be made again,thank you for posting.""Keep Smiling:)"""
133174,73033,2007-02-19,5,Light and fluffy and oh so easy.  The sour cream really makes a world of difference.  I used a sharp cheddar cheese as well and served this with fresh blueberry scones.
126104,73033,2007-03-03,4,"These were very good.  I wasn't sure about the sour cream, but I think it probably made it just a less dry egg.  I think these would be good even without the cheese."
180090,73033,2007-04-05,5,"These were very good and easy to make! Great way to modify scrambled eggs so they have more taste and are moister. I will be making scrambled eggs this way from now on, as long as I have sour cream on hand. Thanks Sharon!"
227607,73033,2007-05-30,5,MMMMM!!!These are great...I can't decide if I like these or the ones with cream cheese the best(and I don't really like scrambled eggs) LOL  Made for ZWT 07
88099,73033,2007-07-04,5,These are just wonderful.  Very rich but loved the flavor and texture.  thanks Sharon for another wonderful recipe.
142367,73033,2007-07-05,4,"Very different, rich texture.  I really liked it, but the family didn't rave, so I couldn't give 5 stars.  Thanks for sharing."
125640,73033,2007-07-08,5,"Quick, tasty recipe. Served with ketchup and a dash of hot sauce. I usually make scrambled eggs with milk and this wasn't much different than usual, but still very good. Thanks."
207176,73033,2007-07-18,5,Great Breakfast.  I scaled the recipe down for just one (me) and they were salty enough with the sour cream and cheese that I didn't need any extra salt.  I didn't have biscuits but you don't need them either!  Great on this rainy morning. Thanks!
74652,73033,2007-07-31,4,I made these again and decided to give them another star. These are really good! I saw her make them too and had to try them. I added some chopped green onion on the top and that is what really made them for me! Very creamy. Thanks for sharing.
229524,73033,2007-11-04,5,Very good.  I used the eggs to make breakfast burritos.  Like the fact that this makes  creamy scrambled eggs.
358796,73033,2007-12-28,4,"Good, creamy eggs. I made this using 5 eggs."
140132,73033,2007-12-30,5,"Very creamy.  Cooked perfectly, thanks for the recipe....Stephanie"
191533,73033,2008-01-11,5,"Scrumptious! I'm trying to make some meals that are lower carb, and this made a nice breakfast-for-dinner. I used sour cream that had the ranch dip mix in it, and that tasted good in the recipe! Served with kielbasa and roasted asparagus."
331557,73033,2008-02-10,3,I liked these but I don't think I liked them enough to justify the high amount of calories from fat (especially saturated fat) in the dish.  The sour cream was a nice change and I added some cilantro and onion for additional flavour and colour.  Thanks for sharing.
394077,73033,2008-04-22,5,I love these eggs.  I didn't use the cheese and I used milk instead of water.   The eggs came out delicious and soft.  Keeper.
383346,73033,2008-05-15,5,"I omitted salt and pepper.  And since I didn't have cheddar cheese, I used emmenthal.  That's really good.  We have loved it.  And I made it for my lunch of tomorrow (we took a few bites LOL).  Thanks Sharon.  Made for Zaar Star Game."
218535,73033,2008-05-19,5,Quick and delicious. A keeper.
280271,73033,2008-06-25,5,Excellent way of making scrambled eggs. They came out light and fluffy. I did add an additional topping of salsa to the eggs. We enjoy the added spice. Thanks Sharon for posting.
461834,73033,2008-10-13,5,"These scrambled eggs were DELICIOUS!!!  I made these for brunch, along with homemade biscuits and canteloupe!!!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe Sharon.  Made for stars tag."
147109,73033,2008-11-04,3,These were way too runny for our tastes. Thanks though!
373817,73033,2008-12-23,5,Delicious!
229850,73033,2009-02-16,5,These were good. Served them as sandwich on a toasted Bagel. Ummm!
222564,73033,2009-05-29,5,Lovely cheesy eggs.
407007,73033,2009-08-07,5,"Wow this recipe makes GREAT scrambled eggs! I scaled it down for just me, used all low-fat ingredients, and served it on a hot tortilla with fat free refried beans and salsa. (I'm a Texan, what can I say? :)) The eggs were so fluffy and yummy. Will definitely make this again -- thanks for sharing!"
355637,73033,2009-08-24,4,"Very good! I typically am not a fan of scrambled eggs, but these were good."
969481,73033,2010-01-01,4,"Well I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my eggs turned gritty and watery. I generally love Paula Deen's recipes, so I'm sure it's something I did.."
1133190,73033,2010-03-09,5,I love replacing the milk I traditionally use in scrambled eggs with sour cream!  I usually omit the water called for in this recipe and still use cooking spray instead of butter. Thanks for posting!
226863,73033,2010-04-28,5,"First time I've put sour cream in my scrambled eggs, usually I just add milk or cream.  Delicious addition!  Loved the sharp cheddar in this...thanks for sharing your (or Paula's) recipe!"
305531,73033,2010-04-30,5,Yum! I really liked the creaminess that the sour cream gave these delicious eggs. Thanks for sharing Sharon. Made for I Recommend Tag.
32058,73033,2010-05-01,5,the sour cream does make a difference!  Love the flavor.
369715,73033,2010-11-03,5,Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written and we all enjoyed these.
1365025,73033,2012-02-12,5,"Very good and creamy. I could taste the sour cream but it tasted good, like it belonged there. I used shredded Colby Jack cheese as that's all I had on hand. These were so light and fluffy. From now on I'll make a omelet out of this so the cheese doesn't melt all over the pan and stick. Made for I Recommend game."
33159,73033,2012-12-28,5,Really nice fluffy way to make eggs - the cheese is a nice touch.  This recipe was part of our Christmas morning brunch this year.
312577,222188,2007-05-09,5,I have used this recipe twice.  It is a really good frosting recipe.  I live in Los Angeles and went to Sprinkles the other day and their vanilla cupcakes are very good.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
95743,222188,2008-04-14,0,"I don't believe I've ever had buttercream frosting.  It's not the type of thing I would normally eat for the last several years and my  memory of childhood frosting used Crisco, something I wouldn't even consider now in this quantity.  It took a bit of getting used to but after some adjustments and a spatulaful or two, the butter version grew on me. ; )   I turned half the batch into chocolate by adding 1/2 cup cocoa.  I liked that best, being a chocoholic.  I think cream cheese is my frosting of choice but this is a perfectly acceptable substitute for butter fans."
104295,222188,2008-07-04,5,"Very good buttercream!  My cousin is a pastry chef and hers is the best ever, but mine was pretty darn good!  I used it to decorate some 4th of July cupcakes and they held the sprinkles well.  Thanks."
142559,222188,2008-12-03,5,This is a quick and delicious buttercream! Very simple to make!!  It is the only buttercream I use now.
229850,222188,2008-12-16,5,"This is the best buttercream icing I have EVER used !! I did increase the milk a little though, but it was PERFECT.  Worked great in my pampered chef decorator facile to make fantastic looking cupcakes, they looked like they came from a bakery and tasted like it as well. They were a hit!"
324621,222188,2009-01-17,5,"This worked well for my son's Hot Wheels birthday cake this weekend. I was out of shortening and couldn't make it to the store in time, so I couldn't make my regular frosting. I was happy to find a recipe that only called for the butter, and it turned out nicely!"
1269015,222188,2009-07-19,2,"This icing had a very rich buttery taste I personally found to be too strong - I like my buttercream more creamy than buttery - and it melted right off my room-temperature cupcakes (that probably has more to do with the humid, 95*F+ weather around here - this is one frosting that definitely needs to be refrigerated). It was good enough in spite of that, but I'll find a better recipe to make in the future."
894666,222188,2009-09-08,5,"I for some reason have a hard time making frostings come out to my satisfaction but this one was FOOLPROOF and that tiny bit of salt makes all the difference in the flavor!! I made a quarter of the recipe and iced 12 cupcakes, was the perfect amount since I don't like so much frosting it takes away from the cake. Thanks for this new go-to!"
91392,222188,2009-10-29,5,"Perfect vanilla frosting, easy, fast and sets up nicely.  I won't need to look any further than this one!"
140806,222188,2009-11-19,5,"I've never made vanilla buttercream before, only chocolate. This recipe REALLY takes the cake! I had to add a little extra milk, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Light flavor, fluffy and delicious!"
315055,222188,2010-01-24,5,"Very yummy, I was able to frost a total of 48 cupcakes with this, and it kept well at room temp!  Thanks so much!
Update: I halved the amount and used it for sugar cookies - delicious!  I would recommend adding a little more milk to make a better spreading consistency (and a little more vanilla if halving the recipe)"
8629,222188,2012-01-28,5,"This is a great recipe. It is very sweet.  If you want to be sure to have enough to frost, fill and decorate cupcakes or a cake I would suggest making either 1.5 times or 2 times the amount of frosting.  I frosted red velvet cupcakes with this frosting."
68884,222188,2010-12-28,3,I guess I'm a detractor %u2014 I found this frosting TOO stiff and too sweet. I piped it on cupcakes. Not my favorite!
140132,222188,2011-02-09,5,Perfect frosting.  I used this on some cupcakes last night and it was the perfect consistency.  Thank you for sharing.
92816,222188,2011-04-24,5,"This is the almost perfect frosting recipe.The only thing I would change for the next time I make this would be to use unsalted butter.I found that I could taste the salt from the butter too much.But other than that it was easy to put togther and makes quite a bit.<br/>Update April 2011:I didn't even realize I had already made this frosting...and this time I have no complaints...strange.Anyway,I used this recipe on Easter cupcakes I made.Check out my photo."
789516,222188,2011-09-07,5,Yum!
103876,222188,2012-01-02,5,"Very good and easy.  Needed to add a bit more vanilla/milk to get the right consistency, but it worked well."
173579,222188,2013-02-04,5,Very nice frosting.  I had rave reviews from my family.  Thanks for posting.
368078,222188,2013-03-11,4,"It was a little too sweet for us, but had a good flavor.<br/>Update: made again, and used only 3 C powdered sugar and 1 T 1/2 and 1/2.  Turned out great!"
839492,222188,2013-04-20,5,"Excellent. I was almost tempted to add a little more salt, maybe next time. This tinted &amp; frosted one 8&quot; round &amp; 12 regular sized cupcakes beautifully. Definitely recommend with recipe #94886. This was probably the best cake I&#039;ve made in a while, thanks for sharing!"
145352,222188,2013-05-02,5,Easy and delicious!
131021,222188,2013-07-30,5,This frosting was great. I needed to add more milk to make it the right consistency. We then split it into bowls and added coloring. It was a big hit at the frost your own cupcakes part of the birthday party.
198154,222188,2013-08-07,5,I make a lot of cakes and therefore have tried lots of frosting recipes. This one  is my new favorite vanilla buttercream recipe!! The best I have tried by far!!
1179225,222188,2014-05-18,5,"Perfect butter cream icing! It spreads beautifully, would change a thing. Thanks for sharing the keeper recipe."
100526,222188,2014-11-08,5,Delicious and easy! Perfect compliment to a chocolate cake!
456858,222188,2014-11-25,4,"We had not ever attempted to make frosting B4.  We always bought fresh buttercream frosting from our local bakery.  This frosting was good and will probably make again.  Update:  Did make again, but used 2 teaspoons of milk instead of just 1 teaspoon....wonderful.....just wonderful....almost as good as Publix buttercream frosting.  I luv a simple white cake w/ simple white frosting.  Made a Duncan Hines white cake, topped it w/ this frosting...OMG!!!  Exactly what I was craving.  I ate 3 pieces of the double layer cake in one day!!!  I spent all of about $6!"
55578,17126,2006-09-12,5,"Excellent, very easy, very tasty!!"
52125,17126,2003-02-19,5,Excellent tasting rice!
37636,17126,2003-04-04,5,"This was great! I found that the rice cooked perfectly as directed (I used basmati rice). It was both quick and easy to prepare. I did up the seasoning just slightly, and added some chopped jalapeno to the rice for an added kick (it didn't turn out too spicy, but just right!) I would definitely make this again! Thanks for a great recipe!"
101034,17126,2005-05-03,5,"This is my kind of recipe!! It was actually easier than making the store bought and so much more tastier. It had a wonderful flavor, all the ingredients blended perfectly. I used diced tomatoes with green chilis, which gave the rice a nice little kick!! Thanks Sharlene "
9869,17126,2005-07-22,5,"Served this with enchiladas for a very tasty dinner, liked the flavour the added cumin gave...and it looked so nice on the dinner plate."
110078,17126,2005-08-26,5,Good flavor and very easy to put together.  I have been looking for an easy Spanish Rice and this would be it!  Thank you for posting=)
37036,17126,2006-08-04,5,This rice turned out wonderful!  I used only 1 teaspoon of chili powder because my FIL was eating with us and I didn't want it to be too spicy for him.  We all enjoyed it very much and I will be making it again!
68884,17126,2007-04-09,4,"This is pretty good; I did have to adjust the cooking time and liquid amount because I used brown rice. I easily halved the recipe, except I wound up using the full amount of chicken stock, and I omitted the butter to reduce the fat."
132383,17126,2007-06-03,5,"We loved the taste of this rice.  My husband is Puerto Rican and said this was the best ""Spanish"" rice he had ever tasted.  Thanks for posting."
426903,17126,2007-07-16,5,Great combination of flavors. My guests loved it. Cooking in one pot made it so easy. Thanks for posting.
124249,17126,2007-07-21,5,"This spanish rice tasted very good and wasn't to spicy for children to eat. This went very well as a side dish to recipe #210460 fried tacos.

Thanks Sharlene~W.

Bullwinkle"
187373,17126,2007-08-05,3,"This was a pretty good spanish rice recipe.  DH didn't really care for it, but I thought it was okay. Served with some queso fresco on top and made with jasmine rice, as I can never get other rice to turn out well...
Overall, an okay side dish but nothing spectacular."
158086,17126,2007-09-26,5,"I added green pepper and onion, and put cheese on top to melt just before serving...great stuff..."
47559,17126,2007-10-08,5,"I followed the recipe to a T, and wouldn't change a thing.  Delicious.  Thanks for posting it, Sharlene~W!"
285039,17126,2008-01-12,4,Quick and easy Spanish Rice.  I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed to avoid the mashing step. Quite yummy.
140132,17126,2008-01-16,5,"Easy, tasty.  We loved it. I will make again.....Thank you very much....Stephanie"
185446,17126,2008-01-25,5,"This halves easily and tastes great.  Thanks for another good recipe, Sharlene."
489552,17126,2008-06-25,5,"Wow i couldn't beleive how good and easy this recipe was.  This was my first time making Spanish rice and I am hooked as of today.  I used par-boiled whole grain white rice, and worked just lovely.  I tripled the recipe to feed 4 (yes we love leftovers for work) and worked out just great.
My family loved it.  Thank you for a great recipe."
125640,17126,2008-07-13,4,"This was good and very easy. I cut the recipe down  to 1/3 (using extra broth), and it came out nicely. Next time I would double the garlic salt and add a little pepper. Thanks for sharing."
80998,17126,2008-07-17,4,"So easy and so tasty.  I needed a side dis for creamy burriot casserole and found this.  I had some brown rice in the freezer so I put everything together , cooked the rice in the microwave and then added it to the sauce mixutre and let simar.  Turned out great.  Thanks."
377581,17126,2008-08-19,5,Very tasty! it worked well as a side dish for our taco dinner and it was easy. Thank you for posting!
182624,17126,2008-10-12,4,"Very tasty and easy side dish.  I ran out of chicken stock so used a combo of chicken/veg stock, otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I served this with Recipe#127295 and Recipe#234818."
185926,17126,2008-11-20,5,WOW.  This is tasty and simple.  I put everything into a rice cooker and pushed the button.  Came back 20 minutes later everything was done.  I will make this again.  Could not be easier.  Thank you.
353131,17126,2009-01-13,5,Wanted to make spanish rice and looked at several different recipes. This one sounded good and easy. It was done in about 20 minutes. DH and I loved it. I will definitely make it again.Did not use garlic salt used garlic powder.It was saltly enough because I had to use chicken boullion.
189616,17126,2009-07-01,5,Very tasty! The only thing I did different was that I added a couple of splashes of Franks RedHot and I prepared this in the microwave instead of stovetop. Thank You Sharlene!
59163,17126,2009-08-25,4,I was looking for something quick to fix with oven-fried chimichangas and found this.  I love it when I find recipes where I have all of the ingredients on hand.  This was super easy to throw together with wonderful results.  This was a perfect side to my main dish. We added a little shredded cheddar on top.
53932,17126,2010-01-10,5,Excellent! Perfectly seasoned.
839492,17126,2010-09-23,4,"Really liked this recipe. I used brown rice & canned crushed tomatoes instead of stewed. I also added some cumin as well as a small can of diced green chiles after all was complete, I thought it needed a little ""more punch"". So much better than the boxed variety. You're also able to manage the sodium which is a plus. FYI- This makes a lot! Thanks for sharing, we'll be making this again!"
74281,17126,2010-11-08,0,"December 17, 2007: Fabulous recipe. I blended the tomatoes as suggested and followed the recipe as written otherwise. I gave a big scoop of this to my Dad who always skips the Spanish rice and he ate the entire thing, raving about how good it was the entire time. Even the babies loved this rice as it is not hugely spicy. Easy and delicious means this recipe will become a regular in our family! November 8, 2010: I have tried other Quick Spanish Rice recipes but NONE as good as this one and it continues to be my ""go to"" recipe for Spanish Rice. I now start with 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil and saute the rice first which <br/>keeps the grains separate and prevents the rice from sticking to the pan. Then add the rest of the ingredients and follow the directions. Try this rice.... you'll love it!"
37449,17126,2013-11-01,5,Yum! I used diced tomatoes with mild chiles and fresh oregano from the garden. Thanks!
124190,50719,2004-06-27,5,Very good! Loved them!
89831,50719,2004-06-30,5,"Well,what more can I add that already hasn't been said...these were just amazing muffins. I made mine in jumbo muffin tins, and added 1 tsp of pure almond extract instead of vanilla, I think the almond goes better with blueberries than vanilla...I made them with half and half cream instead of milk, and used frozen (semi-thawed) blueberries, I let them thaw a bit so the muffins would have a nice blueberry streak in the middle. These muffins had a wonderful texture and taste, I will be definately be making them again, thanks so much for sharing....Kittencal:)"
146486,50719,2004-08-02,5,These were really good.  I used frozen blueberries and they turned out great.  I made 12 jumbo muffins and doubled the topping too.
37036,50719,2004-08-12,4,"These muffins were really good.  I made them for work and my co-workers really liked them.  I thought they were more like the texture of a cake instead of a muffin, but I still enjoyed them.  I used frozen blueberries and mixed them into the batter while still frozen.  Thanks for sharing!"
126440,50719,2004-08-13,0,These muffins are awesome.  Very easy to make and delicious.
8688,50719,2005-01-14,5,"This is an excellent recipe for blueberry muffins!  More of a cake-like consistancy than your usual muffin. Next time I prepare, I will remember to double the toppings! I will definitely make again!  Loved it.  Thanks so much, KRUSTY!

"
222970,50719,2005-07-19,3,"These were fine, but not ""The Best."" They were actually kind of tasteless, or ""bland"", as another reviewer put it. They did all get eaten though! I used butter and frozen ""wild blueberries"" from Costco. "
92816,50719,2005-08-17,5,"These deserve a 6 star rating.I can see why so many people have given these great reviews!They are absolutely delicious.
I used Vanilla Milk instead of regular milk in my recipe.It's a new product here that I thought would be great in this recipe and it is.I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg in the topping just beacuse I'm not really fond of nutmeg.It is a wondeful muffin recipe.One I'll be making often."
142464,50719,2006-03-25,5,"As Sylvie said in her review thes muffins do deserve the ""Best"" in the title.  What an absolutely fantastic muffin!! Made them this morning and couldn't wait to try them. I have made various recipes in search of the perfect blueberry muffin and now I need look no further.  They are chocked full of berries and have a nice light texture. Mmmm, pardon me while I take another bite  <img src='http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_10_4.gif' border=0>"
121185,50719,2006-06-26,5,These were great!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour....They tasted just like to kind you get from costco! (just smaller)
173314,50719,2006-09-04,5,loved them!  made half with blueberries and half with milk chocolate chips. baked about 22 minutes. I'm ready for our first week back to school lunch snack!
402559,50719,2007-04-01,5,"Wonderful, light & fluffy, not too sweet. Thanks for sharing!"
324621,50719,2007-05-26,5,Very good muffins! Made these as a thank you gift for a friend and she said they were excellent too! Mine made 12 regular sized muffins AND 6 jumbo muffins.
180090,50719,2007-07-28,5,"Very yummy! I really liked these, they were cakey and tender. I followed the recipe exactly, except used cinnamon instead of nutmeg for the topping. Baked up in exactly 20 mins. The bottom part kinda stuck in the pan so I'll use muffin liners next time. Thanks the the great recipe!"
529278,50719,2007-08-17,5,"Yet another 5 stars for this recipe.  I won't ever make boxed blueberry muffins again!  It did take me longer than the 10 minutes prep, but they were very worth it.  I wasn't sure about how they looked when they came out of the oven, but after taking them out of the pan, I decided they looked pretty, in a home-made sort of way.  Ran completely out of sugar in the middle of this recipe, so I didn't make the topping.  Just shook some cinnamon sugar on top.  Didn't really notice it though.  The one thing I will be sure to do next time is put a small spoon of plain batter in the bottom of each muffin-well, because these were SO blueberry-full that most of mine baked up on a bed of blueberries, that made the bottom too juicy to be eaten cleanly."
138429,50719,2007-08-23,5,Wonderful recipe. Not much more that I can add that has  not already been said except that I used wild blueberries. The muffins turned out perfect. Thanks for this great trecipe.
185285,50719,2007-08-27,5,"I liked these OK the first day and was going to rate them 4 stars - but on Day #2 and #3 these muffins were actually better!!  I'm not sure why, but it's great to have a muffin recipe where making them ahead of time actually improves the taste. Thanks for posting!"
185446,50719,2007-12-25,4,"A great way to use up leftover blueberries; this is easy and tastes good too.  That's all I ask for out of muffins!  Thanks, Krusty!"
250031,50719,2007-12-27,5,"Very good and very easy. The batter, I thought, needed a little more flavor. I only used 2 cups of blueberries and they were still very blueberry filled. Addendum 12/27/07: I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the batter and that's all it took to up the rating from 4 stars to 5 stars."
51011,50719,2008-03-20,5,"I made these this morning, and loved how quickly they came together.  For me, the recipe made 16 muffins.  I was worried with all of the blueberries, but everyone at work loved them.  Thanks for sharing!"
218535,50719,2008-05-06,3,This is good but not sweet enough for my family.
242484,50719,2009-07-13,5,Very nice!  Will be my go-to blueberry muffin recipe from now on!
131021,50719,2009-07-26,5,"I love that the muffin cup size was right on, for me anyway, as it seems like I ususally have many more muffins than everyone else does for any recipe. They were great tasting and we loved them. I gave to my kids' Sunday School teacher and she loved them too."
373817,50719,2010-01-27,5,I made these tonight to go with our potato soup. They were so delicious! We liked how they were not too sweet and how the texture was light and fluffy! Thanks!
789516,50719,2010-05-20,5,so. good. period.
8629,50719,2010-07-18,4,"I made a half recipe because I didn't have the full amount of blueberries that was called for.  I also used another chef's recommendation for a struesel topping - * 1/4 cup all-purpose flour * 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon * 1/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar * 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, slightly softened. The muffins were very good."
844554,50719,2010-10-29,5,I agree -- 5 stars for these. Very good!
532289,50719,2011-04-05,5,Wonderful.  The only change I made  was to add 1/4 t cinnamon to the topping along with the nutmeg and sugar.  Baked in 25 minutes.  Thanks for sharing.
2041603,50719,2011-10-25,5,"Wow, you were not joking about these being the best! They aren't exactly muffins, but amazing. I'm a great fan of the batter and my husband a huge fan of the muffins (he's the blueberry eater!) Easy to make, easy to get rid of!"
103876,50719,2011-12-05,4,"These muffins are very good!  My whole family liked them.  I'm not sure they're my perfect muffin, probably because they are more cake like than true muffin texture, but they were still nice tasting and easy to make."
176615,50719,2013-06-29,5,Very good! Tons of blueberries. I used frozen wild berries and topped with natural sugar rather than the nutmeg mixture. Made 18 regular-sized muffins. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
447123,50719,2013-08-21,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE these muffins. These are so incredibly easy. I have used fresh blueberries as well as frozen and they are always awesome. One thing I do to make it extra special is add a butter based crumble on top and WOW does it make it that much better. Everyone loves these. Thanks KRUSTY for this great recipe and making me look like an awesome chef!
928301,50719,2013-09-05,4,"people said they liked it &amp; it turned out nice &amp; moist, but lacked a crispiness I wanted."
1581225,50719,2017-02-06,5,"Mmmm, these were divine! So good fresh out of the oven while still warm. Lovely with fresh blueberries, but I'd make these with frozen too when fresh ones are out of season or ridiculously expensive. They were nice and sweet, and the topping make a nice, crunchy coating."
1052873,50719,2017-08-04,5,Yummy. I mixed the blueberry with 1 cup of the flour so they didn't sink. Took about 25 minutes in my silicone muffin cups. Made 20 muffins.
9869,69089,2005-08-06,5,"This is so easy to put together and tastes great.
Made this on a night when I didnt have a lot of time and couldnt really be bothered cooking..this recipe was perfect a few minutes preparation and the rest takes care of itself.
Thanks for sharing."
32058,69089,2005-09-10,4,"Missing something.  We ate it and it filled us up, it just didn't say WOW"
101034,69089,2005-09-28,5,"This was delicious.....and so simple!! I didn't change a thing, but next time I was thinking of adding shredded mozzarella cheese instead of the parmesan. Thanks for posting"
49304,69089,2005-11-02,5,"Delicious, easy to make and everyone loved it. I made it just like the recipe stated and I will be making this again & again. Thank you very much for posting this recipe."
184723,69089,2005-12-11,5,"I made this a couple of weeks ago and forgot to review.  I came back to make it again.  I must confess I was the only one who loved this dish.  I guess my husband and little boy aren't too fond of the tang the artichokes added.  Make only if you like artichokes and if you do, you won't be dissappointed."
60992,69089,2006-03-03,5,"WOW,WOW,WOW!!!! This is yummy!!! I usedlite mayo and added LOTS of garlic and a generous amount of cayenne. After spreading this mixture on the chicken breasts I sprinkled all with paprika! Only then did I realize I forgot to season the chicken...but NO worries, this is seasoned beautifully! The chicken is really moist and flavorful, and I will make this as often as I think I can get away with it!!!"
174991,69089,2006-03-29,5,"This is a ""company is coming"" recipe.  The only changes that I made was pounded the breast flat and mixed the other ingredents in the blender and spread it over the chicken.  The next time  I'll try rolling up the pounded chicken.  Oh, I used light mayo and that worked fine. "
137911,69089,2006-03-29,4,"This is a very easy dish to make.  The chicken turned out very tender and moist.  The amount of topping to me was so very rich and made quite a lot.....enough for about 6 chicken breasts instead of 4. I would make again, but spread the dip over more chicken.  Thanks!"
55729,69089,2006-05-16,5,"We all thought this was awesome! No changes, and very tasty for such an easy dish."
182624,69089,2007-01-08,4,"I suppose I'll add mine to all the rest!  This is a great dish.  I cut up my chicken in smaller pieces, and I'm glad I did.  I think it just coats it a bit better.  I also used a fresh garlic clove instead of the powder.  The amount of sauce vs. chicken is perfect!  It was served with roasted asparagus and a side of rice.  YUM!!"
74281,69089,2007-03-21,4,This turned out really good and everyone in the family loved it. It was so easy to make although I had to bake mine for an hour to get the chicken completely cooked. I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers for lunch and they heated up really nicelyin the microwave. Thanks for the post Yopper!
286851,69089,2007-05-26,3,"My husband and I thought this was OK. It does taste somewhat like an artichoke dip, over chicken. It was very easy to make. I had a hard time with getting the artichoke mixture to stick to the chicken. When it was time to serve the chicken, the topping just slid off. The taste was fine, it just didn't look as appetizing as I had hoped."
248023,69089,2007-12-28,5,"A very easy recipe to prepare indeed!!!  Did I also mention delicious?  I used two chicken breasts and the remains of a jar of artichoke hearts that were in the refirgerator.  I also threw in some sliced mushrooms ( they needed to be used up) and a little shredded mozzarella.  I did go light on the parmesan and mayo... I added just enough mayo to moisten the mixture.  I piled it high on the chicken and it turned out beautiful... it really is nice enough to serve company.  I seasoned the breasts with salt and pepper before topping just to make sure they would not turn out bland. Great, rich and filling entree...  I served it with Recipe #128563 and some steamed broccoli with a little butter and lemon juice.  The lemon really went well with this dish b/c it helped ""brighten"" up some of the flavors and richness...  Thanks for sharing!!!"
43083,69089,2008-01-06,5,YUM! I made this y'day for my family and they absolutely freakin loved this! Its like artichoke dip on chicken. MMMMMM! :) Even my 5 yr old ate it and thats an accomplishment:) Thanks Yooper!
482376,69089,2008-01-18,5,"Fantastic. I could really eat the artichoke mixture all by itself. It's just like a dip. The chicken turns out moist and with the mixture on top - it's a winner.
Next time I'm going to cube the chicken and make it a casserole with brown rice.  Thanks!"
218535,69089,2008-02-04,4,I thought this was very good but my family refused to eat the artichokes so I gave it 4-stars.
18391,69089,2008-02-27,5,"Pretty good but way too heavy for our taste. I reduced the mayo to half a cup and still did not use the full amount on the chicken. The same thing the other reviewer mentioned about oil pooling happened to me too. Wouldn't make it again although it wasn't bad. Thanks. UPDATED: I made this again with a quarter to a third of the amount of cheese and mayo. Also added one small chopped onion. With these changes, this is a definite 5 star recipe! Thanks!!"
774665,69089,2008-10-14,5,"What's not to love about this recipe. It's super easy, super fast, super delish! I only had marinated artichoke hearts but it didn't matter--they were great. I served it with garlic couscous. yum!"
1122161,69089,2009-06-21,5,"I made this exactly as written and it was very good! Low calorie, easy, and tasty! The chicken turned out so moist! Excellent recipe! Thank you!!"
879716,69089,2009-07-02,5,"An instant favorite! I can't believe how easy this was - even though I had to make my own mayo because my jar was empty! I used Recipe #71967 for the mayo, adding in a large clove of garlic and I think it made the dish even more special. I layered some chicken flavored rice on the bottom of my casserole dish followed by cubed chicken breast and the artichoke mixture on top. Added some Italian blend cheese during the last few minutes of baking - not that it needed it but because we are suckers for cheese! Think I'll have to make this when Mom comes to visit. Thanks! :)          (Note:  Don't use chicken thighs if you are making this into a casserole - everything got really greasy and seemed to take forever to bake)"
140132,69089,2010-11-22,5,"Oh yooper this is so good. I made this last night for my family and I was practically licking the pan clean.  These looked to elegant.  I served them with herb buttered noodles, green beans and beets.  We loved the combo of the parm. cheese and artichoke with the chicken.  Thank you so much for sharing this lovely recipe with us."
111291,69089,2011-02-28,5,"very, very yummy!  i used half lite mayo/lite sour cream; otherwise stuck to the recipe.  served it over egg noodles, but next time think i will serve it over a bed of slightly wilted fresh baby spinach leaves with a splash of fresh lemon juice.   :-)  thanks for posting what is sure to be a repeat recipe in my home!"
269331,69089,2011-03-15,5,"The only thing I did differently was to add some fresh mushrooms.  I think with that being said, I would use canned mushrooms instead or sauté them first, because it added a bit of water to the sauce.  Oh, I also used artichoke bottoms instead of heart (what I had on hand).  Per some reviews, I think I will try ½ mayo and ½ sour cream next time just to see how it turns out because I think it broke a bit.  Very yummy!"
653438,69089,2011-12-22,5,"Made for Let's PARTY 2011 and we did party with this recipe...so delicious!  I did use only about 1/2 cup mayonnaise (all I had) and added fresh garlic, onion and some hot sauce to it.  Another wonderful recipe to put into my cookbook of Favorites for 2011.  Thank you for posting."
894666,69089,2016-05-18,5,"This had great flavor for so few ingredients. I added some leftover fresh mushrooms and also some Italian seasoning paste, topped with Italian bread crumbs, love the versatility, could add some onion or whatever else is needing to get used. Baked the chicken on a rack so it wouldn't get too mushy on the bottom since I wasn't sure how much liquid would bake down. Thanks for this keeper!"
222564,69089,2016-06-18,5,"This is like chicken covered in bubbling artichoke dip! Very delicious, and such a snap to make!"
8688,16531,2002-07-14,5,"Mirj, I made this tonight for supper and we had such a marvelous meal! I made it exactly as directed and  it was done in about 6 hours.  I think the rice with the juices maybe every bit as tasty as the chicken!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!  DH says this is a keeper!"
37868,16531,2002-08-08,5,Easy and Fun...Oh the smell.so wonderful. I used 3 breast and 3 legs 3 thighs. I added the breast the last 3 hours of cooking. It all came out great. We will be making this over and over.
28649,16531,2002-10-06,5,This deserves more than 5*'s.  Any recipe that has my very picky daughter asking me to make it again and having 2 helpings has got to be good.  The house smelled great while it was cooking.  Very easy to put together too.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for another wonderful recipe Mirjam.
37305,16531,2002-11-26,4,"This came out a little different than I expected but the chicken was very moist, just not as flavorful as I thought it would be.  I used a 5 lb. package of thighs, white vinegar and Sprite.  I don't think any flavor was especially strong, which kind of surprised me because I thought either the garlic or brown sugar would dominate.  The family did like it and said that they would like to try it again with chicken breasts, so I will be making it again.  This was very easy and it did smell heavenly.  Thanks for a unique recipe."
60260,16531,2003-01-02,4,I wondered what my husband would think of this recipe since it seemed to have a lot of sugar and he loved the sauce.  I used chicken legs and they were completely overdone so I'll need to adjust the cooking time but he was so gaga over the sauce that he didn't complain too much about the chicken.  I used balsamic vinegar and it was wonderful - the smell in the house was to die for.  Will make it again with some tweaking of cooking time.
54678,16531,2003-04-16,5,"Excellent! We used 8 thighs bone in and skin on - reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup and vinegar to 1/3 cup, and garlic to 2 tbsp minced (12 cloves) Cooked low 6 hours and served over rice."
93006,16531,2003-07-08,5,"5 stars for easy to make, kids LOVE it, and falling off the bone tender!  I used bone-in chicken breasts (skin off of course)."
32772,16531,2003-07-23,5,We really enjoyed this recipe. My whole family thought it was GREAT. Easy to  put together with ingredients I had on hand. I used whole chicken legs because my family enjoys a lot of meat.  Thanks for posting.
42720,16531,2003-08-24,5,"Mirj, I have made this recipe several times already and just now getting around to reviewing it.  My family loves this!!!  Crockpot recipes are a real time saver for me and this one is one of our favorites.  I have made this using leg quarters and whole chicken breasts. Either way it comes out perfectly tender and delicious.   "
46660,16531,2003-09-11,4,"I thought this was very good.  I used 3 bone-in skin-on chicken breasts.  I substituted a mix of balsamic and red wine vinegar, because I was out of regular.  It made the chicken a gorgeous caramel browned color, and it tasted delightful!  I did think that it was lacking salt.  I sprinked the chicken with chopped green onion, and served it with rice and broccoli.  Yum!"
13483,16531,2003-09-11,4,Not much that I can add that hasn't been said.  I think I may have cooked it a bit too long as the chicken was a bit dry.  But the sauce was terrific.
44383,16531,2003-10-01,4,"The one time I didn't read all the reviews, I missed the fact that 6-8 hrs was too long to leave in crockpot.  So the whole cut up chicken I used was a bit dry but hubby still loved it, even going back for huge seconds.  Great tasting sauce too.  Next time, just a few less hours in the crockpot, otherwise this is great easy to do recipe."
8629,16531,2004-01-25,1,"This recipe did not work for me.  I didn't care for the texture of the chicken breasts and they also were very, very dry.  "
59780,16531,2004-03-05,5,"I thought I had reviewed this already! This is great, I have made this a few times and it always turns out great. I usually use chicken leg quarters with the skin removed and dark soya sauce. Thanks for this awesome crockpot recipe!"
37636,16531,2004-03-15,1,"I prepared this a very long time ago (when you were in the hospital)..sorry it has taken me so long to review. I found the flavor of this recipe to be based on sugar and chicken. If one likes sugared chicken, this is the recipe for them. However, it was not to my tastes, and I do like sweet food. Sorry."
33159,16531,2004-06-27,5,"This was delicious & spicy!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts & cooked for 4 hours on high.  The recipe was perfect - I chose to use the cayenne pepper."
125640,16531,2005-09-26,3,"Sorry to rate this so low after all the rave reviews, but I was a bit disappointed in this one. It had a great almost teriyaki smell while it was cooking, but one taste and I didn't even bother to thicken the sauce. I'm glad the only vinegar I had on hand was apple cider vinegar because the vinegar definately dominates the sauce even though I added a little extra soy sauce and a lot of extra garlic, and my husband and I don't especially like the taste of vinegar. Also the chicken still came out a little dry after 7 hours even though I used chicken with the bone in and skin on. My husband did suggest that with the slightly sweet vinegary taste the leftovers might make a good chicken salad, but I definately won't be making this again."
227607,16531,2006-04-10,1,I followed this totally and only one person out of 7 could eat it.  The chicken was not dry but the consistency of the sauce and the taste was definately not for my family.  It is surprising since we love the taste of brown sugar and soy sauce(I use it on my salmon).  I was really looking forward to this too.
377581,16531,2007-03-02,2,"It was quick and easy to prepare, and the house did smell really good all day while this cooked. It sounded wonderful, but we just did not like the taste at all. Sorry."
447123,16531,2007-03-28,3,Not half bad. Not my favorite but was good. Was easy to assemble and would be good if you are feeding a crowd.
357358,16531,2007-04-16,4,"Very easy, tender and tasty. I used ginger ale and it worked well. Thanks!"
146486,16531,2007-06-13,5,"Yum!  I used 1 1/2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I could easily have used this much again b/c there was so much delicious sauce left.  I cooked for 4 hours and it was perfect.  As you already know, great recipe Mirj!!!"
331557,16531,2007-07-14,2,I am sorry but we did not like this - it was so sweet that it made our teeth ache and I even cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup.  It smelled fantastic but we didn't even finish it.  Thanks for sharing though.
140132,16531,2007-08-15,4,"this was a nice surprise to me.  I wasn't sure about the sweetness but it was very good.  I served this with white rice and veggies.  Very nice meal, thank you.....Stephanie"
160974,16531,2008-01-02,5,"This turned out even better than I hoped! I cooked on low for about 2 hours, since I only used about 4 fairly thin boneless chicken that I cut into large chunks. I used a scant 3/4 cup brown sugar and about 1/3 cup cider vinegar and it was perfect. The black pepper really makes this flavor combination stand out. It reminded me of Bourbon Chicken at the mall. Thanks Mirj, for posting.

Roxygirl"
145352,16531,2009-01-05,4,"A little sweet for me, but my DS loved it! Had thirds!!"
1052873,16531,2009-02-07,5,"Made this with rabbit (2 whole fryers). Crockpot on low 5 hours. Picked the meat out, then strained the liquid to get the bones out and thickened the liquid with cornstarch.  Served over basmati rice. It was fabulous!"
353131,16531,2009-05-13,5,I used a little over 3lbs. of split chicken breast. Doubled the sauce. Dh and I thought this was absolutely amazing. Kids had mixed reviews. I will make again!
407007,16531,2012-08-23,3,"I am so sorry, but this recipe didn't work for us... I cooked this for 6 hours on LOW, and came home to black overcooked chicken. It smelled AMAZING and probably is, but I might try cooking it for 4 hours next time?"
489552,16531,2013-10-11,5,"I am so paranoid by this recipe right now as I have it in the crock pot.  At this moment it smells so GOOD. There are so many good reviews as well as many not so good ones.  I am praying that this turns out good as I have all my 3 children over for dinner tonight and I don&#039;t want to throw out 6 chicken pieces with thighs attached.  Here&#039;s to keeping my fingers crossed and I will be back for star review.&lt;br/&gt;UpDate:  This of course is not for those who DO NOT like a sweet flavor dish.  I did add some cayenne pepper which balanced out some of the sweetness.  But this was excellent, severed over rice with saute cabbage on the side."
394077,24088,2007-01-19,5,Delicious.  I love this drink.  Wow.
37779,42603,2003-05-14,5,"Kelly, this is a great way to cook chicken thighs. I used boneless, skinless thighs. The coating was crunchy and adhered well. The chicken meat was very moist and tender. Kudos for the idea of dipping in ranch dressing. It adds a lot to the flavor and moistness. More than satisfied my family of six. Thanks!!"
54678,42603,2003-07-25,4,"Quick, easy but lacking that extra kick that the family enjoys."
176615,42603,2005-08-06,5,"Very good. Coating is nice and crisp with a hint of flavor from the ranch dressing. I don't care for thighs but was on a mission to clear out my freezer. Along with the rest of my family, I did enjoy this dish, which says a lot. Very easy and family friendly. Quick to put together. I baked in a 13x9 glass dish sprayed with cooking spray. It looked messy but cleaned right up. Thanks KeyWee, for posting!"
28649,42603,2005-08-15,5,"The chicken was very moist and tasty.  I made this for dinner and took mine with me to work and heated up in the microwave later and it was still very moist.  It is a very easy recipe and very inexpensive, had everything on hand already.  Thanks Keywee for a great chicken recipe!"
158086,42603,2005-09-13,5,Made this with a combination of thighs and chicken breasts...turned out moist and it made the whole house smell wonderful....
74652,42603,2005-09-21,5,These are so good!  A easy inexpensive weeknight meal. I will make these often.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe! :)
187281,42603,2005-09-29,5,My entire loved these.  This is probably the best way to make chicken thighs that will please the entire family.  I love that it is so easy and inexpensive.  I didn't have corn meal the first I made them and left it out and they were still great.  Highly recommended!
49304,42603,2005-10-18,5,"These are great tasting, moist, easy to make. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and used blue cheese dressing as I found I was out of ranch dressing also used seasoned bread crumbs. This worked great very tasty, My DH loved them.
I will be making these again & again."
97579,42603,2006-07-20,5,"I loved how moist the chicken stayed, even after I reheated the next day.  I think I needed to add just a few more seasonings because we really like to taste them, but overall this is a very good recipe and will be enjoyed over and over!"
8688,42603,2006-09-06,5,"Very tender and flavorful chicken thighs!  This is a simple recipe that could easily be put together on a week night for a great family supper.  The flavor is wonderful and the coating of the chicken gets nice and crispy.  I served this with rice, but mashed potatoes would go perfectly as well.  Thanks so much for a wonderful supper, KeyWee!"
59473,42603,2006-10-26,5,Great tasting chicken. I didn't change a thing. We loved the fact that it was so nice and crispy. I think I may try it with drumsticks next time. Thanks KeyWee.
207176,42603,2007-03-15,5,Easy and good.  I had some pieces with the skin on but next time I'll make them all without skin.  I love recipes like this for week nights. Thanks!
269331,42603,2007-03-25,5,"This chicken is fall off the bone good with a nice crunchy crust.  I followed the recipe, except I did not have cornmeal.  I baked mine for 60 minutes and it turned out PERFECT!"
298447,42603,2011-12-18,5,Family inhaled this!  Everyone raved.  I found it easy to prepare and with great results.  What's not to love?!
136997,42603,2007-09-07,5,"Well, I'll just add another 5 star rating to the others then. LoL! Delicious! I used bone in thighs and removed the skin. I liked the little ""crunch"" the cornmeal gave the coating. Glad I found this recipe. :)"
386849,42603,2007-10-01,3,"This was good! Mine needed a lot longer to bake.  Still, you cant beat the prep time!  Thanks for posting."
394077,42603,2007-10-04,5,Tastes so good but it is so easy it is a crime :)  Thank you for posting it.
68460,42603,2007-10-24,5,"So easy, so tasty!  This is a perfect weeknight dinner recipe.  I made as written, my husband and I enjoyed it immensely.  This will definitely be made again over here.  Thanks for the recipe KeyWee!"
280166,42603,2007-11-08,4,"My whole family inhaled this chicken, including the very picky kid ""who hates Ranch dressing"" and the mom (me) who doesn't really eat meat.  I used boneless and skinless thighs and baked for about 30 mins until brown.  Loved the crunch from the cornmeal!!  The amount of breading was just right also - perfect proportions! This will definitely go into rotation, since on top of being delicious it is also economical!  Thanks for posting!"
666723,42603,2007-12-23,4,I really liked the easy concept and good flavoring on these.  I added a bit more parmesan and reccomend doubling the amount next time.  I had barely just enough coating to cover all 6 thighs.  This is a great recipe when you need something quick and only want to use the items you already have in your pantry.  I will make these again with more ranch and more parmesan.  My hubby dipped his in ranch dressing on the side.
620763,42603,2008-01-07,4,"We all enjoyed this chicken, even the kids! They liked the crunchy coating.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts."
137911,42603,2008-01-13,5,"I made these last week for a Sunday School teacher's dinner meeting pot luck at my house.  I was assigned a main dish and said I would do chicken.  To make this easy to eat, I used chicken tenders.  I baked them for about 20 minutes at 350 and they turned out great!  Lower in fat too.  Out of about 20 pieces of tenders from the bag, and 10 people there, there wasn't one left.  VERY good!"
286851,42603,2008-02-17,3,"I thought this recipe was easy to make with ingredients I had on hand. The chicken was moist and I liked the coating. I followed the recipe exactly, however I did not notice that it particularly had any ranch type flavor, which I was expecting. Perhaps if I had let the chicken sit in the dressing for a bit before coating or pierced the chicken then let it sit I may have had more of a ranch flavor. I will probably make this again and try those things. Thanks for sharing."
173579,42603,2008-04-24,5,Very tasty recipe.  Thanks for posting.
177933,42603,2008-12-05,5,My friend made this last night and she said it was wonderful!  Easy to make.  Her husband said it was like fried chicken.  Thanks!  Updating to say...I made this myself last night and it is really wonderful!!  I used chicken breasts and they were done in about 30 minutes.  They were so tender and delicious!! Thanks!
140132,42603,2009-02-10,4,"This was good and we all enjoyed it but we didnt taste the ranch.  I will make again as we really liked it just a little dissappointed for not tasting the ranch dressing.  Thank you for posting, I liked how the coating got nice and crispy. Yummy."
1072593,42603,2009-05-28,5,"My favorite way to torture my family...the smells of ""delicious""!"
1052873,42603,2012-01-14,5,Excellent with rabbit. Needed a little more Ranch with 2 fryers. Next time might thin the dressing with milk a little.
132383,42603,2010-02-04,5,We'll definitely be making these again.  We used bone in thighs because that is what we had on hand....I'm looking forward to using boneless next time.  This was easy and delicious.
928301,42603,2012-10-24,3,"Easy, but needs more flavor."
218535,42603,2013-02-17,3,I was disappointed after reading all the good reviews. We followed the recipe as written but found the chicken to be bland. It needed more seasoning.
142367,42603,2013-11-11,5,"Thank you for sharing this simple, quick and delicious recipe. I made my own ranch and it was very thick and I found that I should have doubled both the crumb mixture and the dressing. I used potato chips for the crumbs and my own blend of herbs for the seasoning (oregano, basil and garlic). The leftover chicken reheats well and makes an amazing sandwich."
126440,67256,2004-06-03,4,Made this yesterday and it was very good.  We had it for dessert last night and then a very small piece with lunch today. I had to cook mine 1 hour 20 min. before it was done.  I did put it into the freezer as stated. I made half a recipe of the frosting and I could have used a little more.  But was delicious.  Good use of frozen bananas.
138429,67256,2004-06-05,5,This really is the best banana cake! I followed the recipe but had to bake it for 1hr.30 min. It was very level and just a nice golden brown. I served it to visitors and they all went back for seconds.Thank you for a recipe I will have at my fingertips.
93006,67256,2004-06-08,5,"I wish I had never made this cake because now I can't stop eating it!  It is incredibly, incredibly moist (think I'll try the freezer trick on other cakes!).  I think the buttermilk really gives this cake a wonderful flavor.  I used Splenda for half of the sugar, egg sub, and reduced-fat cream cheese to cut calories a bit.  Do not leave off the frosting - it makes this cake to-die-for!"
121185,67256,2004-07-07,4,This was a very tasty and very moist banana cake!  The frosting was also delicious!  I almost had a mess in the oven like another reviewer had stated but thankfully it didn't bubble over completely.  I also had lots of leftover frosting - next time I'll cut it in half.  This cake was REALLY moist without being soggy (except for the center - I should have baked this 15 minutes longer than the 1 hr the recipe called for).  I would have given this recipe 5 stars except for the fact that it tasted like it needed just a touch of spice - some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg would do the trick!
146047,67256,2004-07-25,5,"I loved this cake! Reduced fat and calories to fit my lifestyle. Super moist, even without the post-baking freezer trick! Thanks, Rhonda."
173579,67256,2004-11-19,5,I have been looking for the perfect banana cake.  This is it.  It is fabulous.  Keeps for a long time.
173314,67256,2005-02-09,5,Delicious flavor....my whole family enjoyed this.  Did not use a frosting as we eat more as a breakfast bread.  Cooked in glass 9  x 13 pan and took 1 hr and 20 minutes...placed cookie sheet under as it dribbled over a little.  It had a slight sink hole in on area but that commonly happens to alot of banana breads I make..tasted great and moist. thanks...
184723,67256,2005-02-26,5,"I like really fluffy, light... but moist cakes and this wasn't what I was expecting.  I gave it 5 stars because for the type of cake this is it was good.  Reminded me more of the texture of a pineapple dump cake kind of consistency.  WAY too heavy for my tastes.... but nonetheless...if that's the type you like, it's a wonderful recipe."
64583,67256,2005-05-21,5,Wow!  Very good cake!  I made this after Rhonda J recommended it in my request for a yummy cake.  After reading all the reviews I decided to make it in a pan slightly bigger than 9x13 and I reduced the amount of sugar to only 1 1/2 cups.  It was done in exactly 1 hour.  I cleared out a space in my freezer and put it right in there after baking.  The taste is fantastic and it's very moist - but not overly so.  I also liked it chilled. The frosting is very rich and delicious as well.  I should've only made 1/2 the frosting because I do have a lot left over.  But that's ok.    Thanks Rhonda J!
146486,67256,2005-06-27,5,This got 5 stars by all at the table!  I used 1/4 applesauce in place of some of the butter and used FF cream cheese in the icing.  Couldn't even tell!  Wonderful cake!
32058,67256,2005-09-10,5,"The BEST EVER!  LOVE IT!  The freezer part threw me off but I did it and the results were FABULOUS!  SO, So Moist!"
58836,67256,2005-09-13,0,I rated this already but just wanted you to know that I have been asked by many for the recipe.  Like I said I didn't even frost it and it was delicious.  Was gone in a matter of minutes.
135887,67256,2006-03-26,5,Excellent!  However - my cake took one hour and 20 minutes at 275.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Two of us want to try it without the frosting and two of us love it with the frosting.  Next time I will cut the frosting recipe in half and only frost half of the cake.  Very scrumptious - thanks for sharing!  Now my family is plotting to not eat bananas so I'll make the cake!
199020,67256,2006-07-09,5,"I love moist cakes, so I thought this was great!  I didn't even bother icing it because it was delicious as is.  I ate it with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  It tastes a lot like banana bread, only moister."
222433,67256,2006-09-21,5,Rhonda J...this was some awesome banana cake! I baked mine in a 13x9 and it was done in about 1 hour 15 min. Will definitely make this again because my family loved it. Thanks!
222970,67256,2006-10-14,4,Very good banana bread and delectable frosting but I prefer something less sweet. I will probably return to my banana bread recipe that has a 2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of sugar proportion. I must admit that the cake is very moist. I will have to try your freezer method on other fruit breads.
255338,67256,2006-11-13,5,"Wonderful cake. I used cake flour because I really wanted a fluffy banana cake. Did not need icing at all, cake was great on its own. Thank you for sharing this one. "
227607,67256,2006-12-24,5,This is not just the best ever banana cake...it is the BEST EVER CAKE.  I am not a cake person but I absolutely loved this.  I made a 9x13 pan and a pie pan just to make sure it did not overflow.  I even realized too late that I did not have enough powdered sugar for the frosting but it still turned out wonderful.  I did the freezer part on the big one but did not on the little one.  I will update my review when I try the little one.  The big one was the moistest(without being soggy) cake I have ever had.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.
136997,67256,2007-03-12,5,"What an awesome cake! I was a wee bit sceptical about the oven temp. but it worked. I did have to bake it 1 hr. 30 min though. I tortured my husband by making him wait until the next day to add the frosting, since it had to cool overnight as I hadn't made it until late in the day. So worth the wait he said. :)"
80998,67256,2007-04-29,5,This was very good.  I made it for my son's birthday.  Everyone loved it.  It is a very heavy cake.  It is very filling.  It was easy to make.  I did have to cook it an hour and a half.  Other than that I followed recipe exactly.  Thanks!
64203,67256,2007-07-18,5,"This was a sweet and delicious dessert. It tasted a lot like a sweet banana bread with cream cheese frosting. I followed the recipe except used 2 10 inch round pans, baked at 275 for 75 minutes.

I also cut back the sugar in the frosting, only using 2 cups. It was plenty sweet that way!

Thanks for sharing this hit of a recipe."
97579,67256,2007-08-03,5,"I loved this!  I made 2 - 9"" layer cake.  I did the freezer step.  This cake was very dense and moist, exactly how I like it.  I think next time I will double the frosting recipe as I like lots of frosting in between layers.  I had enought to cover but it was a thin layer in between.  When I did make the batch, I used 2 cups of sugar.  I might add just a tad bit more next time.  Hmm.. I have some sitting in the fridge right now - gotta go!!"
312577,67256,2007-08-24,5,"This is more than ""best ever"" this is the world's greatest cake ever!  I made this in three layers and I think I will make another one tomorrow for my boss's birthday.  I usually do chocolate, but this was so good, I can't wait to share it with everyone at work.  Thank you Rhonda!"
222055,67256,2007-08-25,5,Excellent! Very moist! Made cake exactly as directed but had it without frosting.
461834,67256,2007-09-01,5,This is a very moist and delicious cake.  I cooked mine at 300 degree oven and it took 1 hour and 20 minutes and then went into freezer for the 20 minutes.  It took 5 medium sized bananas to get the 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas.  I think putting the cake immediately into the freezer is the trick to such a moist cake.  Thanks for a great recipe Rhonda*J*!!
56087,67256,2007-09-04,5,"Absolutely delicious!!!  The directions are right on and easy.  I did up my oven temp to 285 and still took an hour and 10 minutes, but with different ovens it's to be expected.
I was 1/2 cup short on the buttermilk but just added enough milk to finish it off, don't think it made to much difference.  Will add this to my favorites.
Thank you for sharing."
347822,67256,2007-11-08,5,"Rhonda, a huge thank you on behalf of my work colleagues for a great banana cake recipe.  I followed the cake recipe to a T.  As instructed, I made room in my tiny freezer and threw in the cake 45 mins. I made the cake the night before so after I took it out of the freezer, I left it out on the counter uncovered.  Before, I served it, I frosted the cake and added the walnuts.  I used a 9 X 13 disposible foil pan and it took me 1 hour and 15 mins. I changed the frosting a little bit, I used  8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. THANK YOU."
229850,67256,2007-11-18,5,"This was very good, I dont think I ever ate Banana Cake before, so I don't know if it the best, but this was REALLY good ! So I bet it is !!"
140132,67256,2008-01-25,5,Oh man was this good.  So moist and flavorful.  I love banana cake and this has to be the best I've had.  This cake didn't last long at our house...lol.  Thank you for this delicious cake recipe....Stephanie
218535,67256,2008-04-01,4,"Good but I won't call it cake. Its texture is more like banana bread. My ""cake"" baked for 1hr 30 minutes. I used half the frosting which is just enough."
316717,67256,2008-04-12,5,this was really good. it did turn out very moist too. next time tho i'll add a dash of cinnamon since we kind of felt the flavor lacked a little. but overall a great banana cake recipe.
168462,67256,2008-05-04,5,"This is an exceptional cake. I made this as written, with the exception I soured the milk with vinegar. It did take about 10 extra minutes to cook.  I took this to a church function and there was none left. This is a very moist cake and the icing complements it perfectly. Thanks for the recipe."
40961,67256,2008-07-19,5,"I would love to give this more than 5 stars. It is so moist and delicious. I followed it exactly and we tasted it with and without the fabulous icing. both were a hit. It also looks very apetizing. I think you are right, putting it in the freezer must be the trick. thanks for sharing a recipe that I will make often."
55578,67256,2008-07-24,5,"It was ok, but tasted like banana bread.  Sorry.  Well I have to re-review this!  The cake tastes so much better the next day!  I'll def make this again!!"
426903,67256,2008-08-04,5,"WOW!!! This cake was amazing. The only thing I think I am gonna change for next time is to half the icing recipe, and just drizzle it all over. Thanks you so much for posting this tasty cake!!!"
64642,67256,2008-08-06,5,Well written recipe and delicious cake.  A keeper!
294000,67256,2008-08-18,5,"Review #284 - FIVE STARS! Already in the family favorite book. I did have to make buttermilk with milk (used skim) and vinegar. My 3-year-old and I had a blast making this cake. My oven took about 1 1/2 hours bake it but then my oven isn't going to be appearing in any ""Home Improvement"" shows anytime soon. Just leave yourself enough time in case it does need to cook extra. It was still somewhat warm even after coming out of the freezer but cool enough to frost. Warning: This cake can make you sick at around the third piece. Don't ask how I know. Thank you so much for a recipe I will hand down to my kids.
Update:  My husband came in from eating his first piece and said this is his ""ultimate favorite icing"".  He made a joke threatening me if I ever dared to make a different icing.  I think I've created a monster!  : )"
250031,67256,2008-08-24,5,"Excellent! We all enjoyed it! It took 1 hour 20 minutes in my oven. I want to make it in round cake pans next, with a layer of the cream cheese icing in between. This recipe should make enough; I had some left over. Maybe some mini chocolate chips in the batter would be a good addition, too!"
808027,67256,2008-09-13,5,"AWESOME cake, very moist.  Loved the trick about putting the layers in the freezer for 45 minutes...great tip.  Frosted with #55530 Cream Cheese Frosting since other reviews indicated the frosting may be a bit sweet.  It was out of this world...loved, loved, loved it.  :-)"
229524,67256,2008-09-17,5,"Can see why this has so many ratings.  My DH really only likes chocolate cake, so I was a little hesitant to make it.....BUT he LOVED IT !!!!!!.  I have made it 2 times now.  It is WONDERFUL....lots of flavor and really quite easy to make.  It really does come out very moist.  I do put a cookie sheet under the pan when I put it in the freezer so as not to melt anything when I put the hot pan in there.  Thanks so much Rhonda *J* for taking the time to share this:)"
74281,67256,2008-09-23,5,"I now know why this recipe has 319 great reviews. It is an easy, moist delicious cake that everyone loved. I left out the walnuts because several people didn't like them, but it was great even without them. My cake took exactly 1 hour to bake in our high altitude Colorado."
37036,67256,2008-09-24,4,"I made this cake following the directions.  We thought it had a great flavor.  I was expecting it to be a little lighter in texture and more cake like, but we still enjoyed it.  I made it just before Hurricane Ike hit and brought it to work the following Monday.  We didn't have any electricity at work or any of the surrounding areas so everyone was grateful for the cake and ate it for breakfast.  I went home with an empty cake pan.  Thanks for posting Rhonda."
386849,67256,2008-10-20,5,"Best ever, yum! Dont open the oven while cooking, though. I did and mine had a well in the center. Had to bake 90 minutes or maybe even longer, but worth it! Thanks!"
182624,67256,2008-10-27,5,"Well, I can't say I've ever had banana cake before, but I know that I'll definitely be having it again! This cake is AWESOME!! It took almost two hours to bake in my oven!! I love the freezer step - it cools the top down so that it doesn't melt the frosting but the bottom stays warm, even after 45 minutes. I just took a few pieces over to my neighbors, and they already called to say how yummy it is. DH also gave it five stars, which doesn't happen very often. We both loved the frosting - and I'm not a frosting girl - and found the amount to be perfect. Thanks for sharing your recipe!  update, two days later...I can't stop eating this!  I'm usually all about the chocolate, but this cake ROCKS!!"
394077,67256,2008-11-05,5,"Best ever!! Forget about putting it in the freezer or frosting. I took a piece right out of oven and it was tender, moist, light, and delicious. Will give further update when it is frosted. UPDATE: With the frosting, it is TO DIE FOR!!!! So buttery good. My favorite cake now.  Oh, it took me exactly 1:20 minutes to bake. Thank you for sharing this wonderful cake recipe. KEEPER!!"
774665,67256,2008-11-30,5,"Yep, this is the best alright! Very good and a winner with my banana loving family. I had to cook it for one hour and 20 minutes."
447123,67256,2009-01-02,5,Delish!!! Yes this is more like a bread than a cake but still it was out of site!!!!!! Easy to put together and very moist. Thanks Rhonda for a wonderful addition to my recipe box!!!
111291,67256,2009-01-19,5,"As if this recipe needs another review, but here goes!!  This is really flavorful and super moist.  I did decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 c. and the butter to about 10 Tbs.  It turned out great and was plenty sweet!!  For all those who made comments about it being banana bread with icing, I would have to respectfully disagree!  I found the texture of mine to be as cake-like as any other cake I would make.  I think it is very important to whip the sugar/butter/egg mixture to as creamy a mixture as possible and to follow the directions precisely as given in order to make a lighter/less dense cake.  Thanks for a keeper!!"
195589,67256,2009-06-01,5,"I had never made a banana cake before and SO glad I chose this one! The frosting was a bit too sweet for us, next time I will start with 1 cup of sugar only. Also, I put crushed pecans in the cake and on the top as I need to use them all up. Very, very good! Thanks for posting, Rhonda."
185446,67256,2009-07-02,5,"Where have I been?  I feel silly being reviewer 528.  This cake was excellent.  Thank you for such good directions--the freezer thing was a bit weird, but if that's what made it taste so good, I'm all for it.  I baked it for 1 Hr 20 Min in a convection oven.  This will be a big hit at our July 4th party."
357358,67256,2009-07-02,5,This cake made my son-in-laws day. Delicious and moist. I had to use milk plus lemon juice and cannot wait to try it again with real buttermilk. Totally worth the effort!
377039,67256,2009-08-13,5,"Outstanding, delicious, never-made-it-to-the-freezer, eaten before I could make the icing GOOD!!!!!"
1179225,67256,2009-08-31,5,"This cake is delicious! I did put in the freezer after baking. I thought I might skip this step next time, but the more I thought about, why mess with perfection. Will be making this cake again very soon. Thank you for posting!"
199792,67256,2009-12-13,5,"Yum! I made it today for my son's birthday and it was very good. It has a nice soft crumb and it is a bit sweet but it is cake, after all! It was so nice to have a non-chocolate cake for a birthday. I will be making this one again. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
489552,67256,2009-09-21,5,"Dleicious!  Delicious!  I made this yesterday as a ""Have a Great Trip"" for my Daughter n Grandson.  They left on a trip this afternoon to Alberta, ""already miss them so much :(""
So I decorated the cake with lots of red hearts, from taking some frosting and adding red food coloring.  My daughter said it was so cute and had her in tears.  I will make it again thank you for posting.  Made for Everyday Is A Holiday Tag Game.  No photo cuz camera was packed, but looks like this recipe doesn't need any more LOL"
937635,67256,2009-12-14,5,"Best Banana Cake EVER!!! I made this for my DD's 1st birthday and got so many compliments! Did the freezer trick and it was moist indeed :) I can't believe I haven't review this before - a friend of mine just asked for the recipe and I went back to email the link and realized I hadn't...it is SO GOOD! Make it, you won't be disappointed!"
8629,67256,2010-01-02,5,"This is a behemoth of a cake.   I followed the cake instructions exactly.  My cake took 1 hr. and 30 minutes to cook at 275 degrees F.  For the frosting, I cut back the butter to 6 T., cut back the confectioners sugar to about 3 cups and added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a pinch of salt to brighten up the frosting. The cake was loved by all."
142559,67256,2010-01-17,5,"This does produce quite possibly the best banana cake ever! However, since I live in a high altitude area (3500 ft) and I used a 3"" deep 8"" round pan, it took more than an hour and a half at 275 degrees to bake. I had enough batter leftover for about 9 cupcakes, which took 30 minutes to bake. I added 2 tbsp. of whipping cream to the frosting mixture. Put them together and this was divine!! Thanks so much for posting - this was an easy recipe and the results were incredible!"
158086,67256,2010-01-22,5,"This recipe probably does not need another 5 stars, but it is worth every one of them....The cake was wonderful, I even used splenda for baking to cut down the sugar and it rose and tasted fabulous...."
371738,67256,2010-01-26,4,"Followed steps as directed, including the freezer step.  Made in a bundt pan.  Could have been more flavorful; bananas were not very noticeable.  The ""cake"" was dense, just like any other banana bread."
520150,67256,2010-01-29,5,"This was a BIG hit with my friends.  It went very quickly.  Had someone call me later to see if I had any left.  One friend said it was in her top 5 of everything I've ever made.  I guess they liked it.  I did make 1 slight modification.  I added 1/2 tsp banana extract to the frosting. Well, 2 changes, I didn't bother with the freezer thing, just let it cool on the counter like usual. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful cake."
44383,67256,2010-02-06,4,"We liked this cake however found it to be a bit ""heavy"" and not big on banana flavor.  For all the work that goes into making it, I was expecting to be blown away by it but wasn't.  I probably won't make it again because of that but we did eat every last morsel of it.  Made it exactly as stated."
1133190,67256,2010-02-25,5,This was really good! Very moist! My go to banana cake recipe for the future.
789516,67256,2012-07-02,5,Amazing!  Made a huge cake!!  Halved the icing which was perfect.  The banana cake was super moist and flavourful.
315055,67256,2010-11-19,5,"I love this cake, especially kept in the refrigerator.  Unfortunately, every time I make it I gain a couple of pounds because I eat almost the whole thing myself, but it's worth it every once in awhile!  Thanks so much for the delicious recipe!"
140806,67256,2011-03-04,5,"Oh, wow!"
187373,67256,2012-03-18,5,"Fantastic cake!  I didn't use the freezer method b/c I was worried about the pan warping and also b/c there is no room in there anyway!  I made it as a 9 inch layer cake.  I didn't make the icing, just used some cream cheese frosting that I had in the pantry.  I toasted some pecans and used them on top of each layer which made it super tasty.  Will definitely make again!"
620763,67256,2012-03-27,5,"This is a great cake. I made half the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan. It took exactly one hour in my oven. I did not put it in the freezer, it still came out moist."
285039,67256,2012-11-04,4,"The texture of this cake is perfect...so moist and delicious!   I divided the batter between 3 9 inch pan and baked it for 50 minutes.   Although I cut down on sugar in both the cake and frosting, I found the cake to be too sweet overall.  Next time I would reduce the sugar in the cake by 3/4 to 1 cup and use my stand by Ginger Cream Cheese frosting in place of the one listed."
180090,67256,2012-11-25,5,"This was very yummy! Moist, sweet and perfect amount of banana flavor. Made some changes based on others reviews: reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cup, reduced butter to 1/2 cup and replaced other 1/4 cup with mashed banana. Halved the frosting recipe, baked at a higher temp, for less time, and made sure not to fill pans more than 3/4 way (used mini loaves pan, an 8x8 and 9 in round cake pan). Perfect dessert to make when you have lots of ripe bananas on hand (used 4 bananas)"
839492,67256,2013-10-17,5,"I realize this doesn&#039;t need 2 more cents....however, additonal praise never hurts! I skipped the freezing step &amp; frosted the cake while still somewhat warm, covered and placed in the fridge. Made the following &quot;tweaks&quot; based on other reviews and/or personal preference or what I had on hand. This cake AND the frosting was devoured in no time. Most went for seconds. I would suggest removing from fridge for at least an hour to let it come back up to room temp for fullest flavor. &lt;br/&gt;Modifications I made: Cake: Used 4 medium bananas (to give you an idea of how many banans);  reduced sugar in cake to 3/4 c total; used 3/4 c. canola oil (in place of butter); used 1 1/2 c. milk with 1 1/2 T of vinegar stirred into it in place of buttermilk and lemon juice. Frosting: reduced powdered sugar to 2 c.; I didn&#039;t have quite enough vanilla extract so I put some vanilla beans in the frosting and it worked nicely. &lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing, this one is a definite keeper and worthy of the high ratings!&lt;br/&gt;Note: It did bake up well at the suggested temperature and really filled the 13 x 9 inch pan."
2549237,67256,2014-03-03,4,"This cake is amazing!  We&#039;ve never had banana cake, so I can&#039;t really say whether it is the best in the world, but it&#039;s really darn good.  I followed the directions precisely and it resulted in a super moist and sweet cake.  The frosting was also very delicious and I could definitely use it on other cakes as well.  Thank you for a delicious dessert that I&#039;m sure will be made frequently in our home.  Thanks Rhonda *J*!"
894666,67256,2016-01-19,5,"5 stars and I haven&#039;t even had a chance to make the frosting yet! Used an 8x6 and an 8x8 pan and was worried it would explode in the oven but it cooked right up to the edge. Definitely watch the cooking time, I know mine took well over an hour, I just kept testing till the toothpick came out clean. My husband wanted banana bread as we had some very sad looking old bananas but I wanted something different and this did not disappoint. This cake was honestly one of the best I think I&#039;ve ever baked, and I didn&#039;t find it to be too time consuming at all. Thanks for this!!!"
1581225,67256,2016-10-26,5,"This is a great banana cake recipe, Mine turned out tasty, soft and moist. The cream cheese icing is so good! I'll make this again for sure."
40961,5170,2003-05-31,0,"I made a double batch this morning for my son's sleepover friends. Wow, DELICIOUS,I will make these from now on, thanks for posting it. 10 stars!!!"
37036,5170,2005-07-31,5,Delicious light and fluffy pancakes!  I used 1/4 cup measuring cup to pour the pancakes and it made eleven 5-inch pancakes.  This is the ONLY recipe I will use for pancakes from now on!  Thanks Bill!
222055,5170,2005-08-04,5,"These are GREAT! We don't have pancakes alot so I don't want to buy the mix and have it just sitting around until we want them. This was easy and they were very good. I (like another reviewer) used 1/4 measuring cup and got 11 pancakes. They were big, light and fluffy and the most important thing- done in the middle! I used my iron skillet and did not need to spray, oil, or butter the pan. 5 stars all the way!"
56087,5170,2005-08-15,5,"These are pretty darn good.  I thought my Buttermilk pancakes were tops, but I have to be honest, this may well be replacing that recipe.  Only thing I did different was to add blueberries... Thanks for a great recipe."
232480,5170,2005-08-21,4,"I don't particularly care for pancakes but my husband likes them.  I've never made scratch ones before - always from a mix - but thought I'd try this today.  They were exceptionally good! I was pleasantly surprised.  We will be keeping this recipe.  Oh, and not sure what I did...I used a 1/4 c. measure and got 19 pancakes???"

124249,5170,2006-06-19,5,"We enjyed these pancakes. Very light and fluffy. Serve with pecan sauce #60756.

Thanks Bill Hillbrich.

64203,5170,2006-10-04,5,"Fantastic fluffy and flavorful pancakes. I made the recipe exactly except I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla... we like vanilla!
Delicious! A Keeper, for sure!"
178742,5170,2006-12-08,4,"Sorry I am so late in reviewing Pete's scratch pancakes, because I have made them 5 times in the past 2 months. Well what can I say, they are a winner! I love making from scratch . I control the freshness of the ingredients, even if they are fattening. I've added pure vanilla extract and pure almond also. Very good additions to with great pancakes from scratch!! thanks for sharing!"
91392,5170,2007-02-01,5,"I'm sitting here eating them, very good, very easy."
447123,5170,2007-02-08,5,Now I can never ever go back to commiting the sin of buying boxed pancake mix. Thank you thank you thank you.
461834,5170,2007-03-18,5,Excellent pancakes.  I cut the recipe in half as there were only two of us eating today.
252816,5170,2007-05-13,5,"These are truly the best homemade pancakes, I have ever had..Wonderfully light and fluffy,great flavor...I even made these ahead and froze for a camping / fishing trip..Just reheated them on a griddle(FAST and no MESS).I will be making pancakes more often..Thank U for sharing this great recipe...."
402559,5170,2007-07-01,5,"Well these are the most perfect pancake I have ever had, thanks!"
230557,5170,2007-07-10,5,Have made these twice now because they're so good!  Thanks Bill :)
529278,5170,2007-07-15,3,"These were much better than the bisquick pancakes, but not as good as I was hoping.  I will have to try them again sometime and see if maybe the problem was me!  My husband thought they had a very good texture.   I agreed, but the outside was more french toast-like than pancake-like.   I wonder if I didn't beat the egg right or something."
140132,5170,2007-11-03,4,I made these for breakfast the other day. Very simple and very good.  We really enjoyed them....thank you....Stephanie
191533,5170,2007-12-26,5,Great recipe! I added Hershey's Cinnamon Chips to the last half of the batter because we love them in pancakes.
125640,5170,2008-01-22,4,"The batter is very quick and easy to mix up. The pancakes turned out really good. Very light and fluffy, plain pancakes. DH still prefers his favorite brand of pre-mixed, but I thought they were nice. The basic lack of cooking directions beyond mixing up the batter keeps this from being a 5-star recipe for me, but I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing."
331557,5170,2008-03-30,5,"I am not huge on superlatives normally but these were the BEST pancakes I have ever had and I will never use any other recipe ever again.  They were extremely light and fluffy but didn't sog down when you added butter, jam or syrup to them.  They didn't even sit in my belly like a brick after I overate them like the pre-mixes do.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe that I will be making again and again!"
248023,5170,2008-05-23,5,We were craving pancakes this morning and these were so easy to fix...  The hardest part was waiting the 10 minutes for the batter to rest!!!  I halved the recipe and it fed the 2 of us just fine... we each had 2 huge 6 in pancakes each!  I loved their fluffiness...  and ease of prep...  thanks for sharing!!!
185285,5170,2008-05-29,5,"I think I love you. Sometimes, when you are an avid cook, you over complicate things. That is what I'd done to pancakes. You know what I've realized? I much prefer light, fluffy, perfectly textured classic pancakes.... for which is the is the PERFECT recipe. Forget the buttermilk, fruitty inserts, cheses, etc.... give me these fantastic pancakes and let me deck them out any way I want. Although, I must admit, I had a hard time doing anything but sponging up the syrup. :)"
359220,5170,2008-06-26,5,"Holy cow!  I was so glad that I chose to make your recipe rather than stir up a batch of Bisquick!  DH and I arrived home last night starved, so I whipped this recipe together and was so suprised with the outcome of these pancakes.  I've come to realize that all pancakes are the same- except these babies!  They're thick, light, fluffy and pretty too!  Smothered in syrup and butter, I'm not sure a meal can get much better.  This will be my go-to pancake recipe forever.  Thanks Brother Williams!"
227607,5170,2008-08-19,5,These were great!!!  So easy to put together and taste wonderful.  I doubled the recipe to feed my hungry kids.  They eat 2 or 3 a piece.  I also added some butterscotch chips to them.  YUMMY!!
394077,5170,2008-10-03,5,"Light, fluffy and soft.  I served with real maple syrup and the crowd went wild. Thanks Brother William."
373817,5170,2008-12-06,5,These are very good! I added some frozen blueberries to ours.
969481,5170,2009-01-28,5,"The kids were off school this morning for a â€œsnow dayâ€� (and it is still snowing!). I decided to surprise them with a pancake breakfast since I had all the ingredients on hand. I took another reviewers advice and added a tsp. of pure vanilla extract as a personal preference. Wow, were these great. I didnâ€™t tell the kids this wasnâ€™t the usual prepackaged mix. As they were devouring their pancakes, the youngest asked â€œMom, what did you do to these pancakes? They are deliciousâ€�. I just smiled and said thanks to chef for posting on Recipezaar. Thanks Brother William for a great recipe and a definite keeper ï�Š ."
176615,5170,2009-02-22,5,Absolutely wonderful! Fluffy and light. Served with maple syrup and recipe #42038. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
307214,5170,2010-04-26,4,A really great pancake - we like to eat these while camping.
1179225,5170,2009-11-17,5,Just right! Thank you.
316717,5170,2010-01-01,5,great recipe for pancakes! and ingredients i usually have in hand. thanks for sharing!
937635,5170,2010-07-11,5,"Perfect pancakes! I used 1/2 tsp of salt because we use sea salt, but everything else stayed the same. Thanks for the great recipe! Update: we made these with 1 tbs of baking powder and a little more milk and they were even better! Not crumbly at all, but not as fluffy - but we like them better this way. Thanks again for the great recipe!"
383346,5170,2010-09-21,5,This is a great recipe for pancakes.  I love thick pancakes and these are perfect.  I just omitted the salt.  Thanks Bill :)  Made for I recommend tag game
789516,5170,2012-02-20,5,1/2 whole wheat flour worked great!
177933,5170,2012-04-04,5,Great pancakes!
146047,5170,2012-10-20,5,"I've been using this as my go-to recipe for pancakes for several years now. They're always great!! I routinely use 2 T olive oil in place of the butter and add 2 tsp diastatic malt powder but I've made them without these changes many times. If you like high, fluffy, pillowy pancakes, they're just really wonderful! Be sure to let the batter sit until it gets airy/puffy and to preheat your pan. I initially hesitated before adding 2 tbsp of baking powder-- seemed like a lot, like it might make these taste like biscuits-- but it's perfect."
369715,5170,2012-11-03,5,This was my first time making pancakes from scratch. Wow these were so good. My husband ate five pancakes and said he could have ate eight of them.I followed the recipe exactly as written. I will make these more often with my families approval LOL
60260,5170,2013-06-05,5,"No reason to buy a mix - this is quick and easy to put together.  There are no issues with the baking powder, I checked my other recipe and this is essentially a &quot;doubled&quot; recipe of the one I have used before.  Great pancakes - added some fresh blueberries and a touch of vanilla."
13796,5170,2014-06-05,5,Delicious pancakes. Easy to make. I used a 1/3 cup measure and got 9 pancakes out of this recipe. I wrap them individually and put them in freezer bags. My mom can enjoy pancakes anytime she wants now. She either pops in the toaster or into the microwave.
540346,5170,2013-08-20,5,"These are very good and super easy.  I make mine with coconut sugar and coconut oil (instead of butter).  I also add some vanilla.   You can make many variations with this basic recipe by adding various ingredients, such as cinnamon, chocolate chips, banana, or apples. These pancakes rise well and are delicious."
315055,5170,2013-09-26,0,These are amazing!  My new go-to pancakes!  So good I&#039;m even considering whipping up a big batch of the mix and canning them to give as gifts for Christmas!
1581225,5170,2016-11-26,5,"Great pancakes, nice and light and fluffy, perfect amount of sweetness. This will replace my previous go-to recipe. The main differences are this one uses butter instead of margarine, and this has more baking powder, giving it more rise."
187373,22015,2014-03-31,5,Yum! I would add more nuts if I make again. Have eaten way too much of it!
47559,31562,2002-10-26,5,"On the way home from work, I was thinking about making a quick shrimp and pasta dish and decided to go to my favorite recipe source.  When I signed on - there it was - the first recipe listed on the first page under recent 5* reviews.  I decided that was meant to be it - so I tried it.   WOW!  Am I glad I did!   I didn't have half and half so I used evaporated milk.  It didn't reduce as well, of course, but the dish was outstanding anyway.  I didn't alter anything else.  Next time, and there will be many more next times, I'll make sure to have all the ingredients.  DH said to give a ""high five"" for this one after he had 3 helpings.  No left overs even with just the two of us!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
49304,31562,2004-08-23,5,"Delicious,Elegant, easy to make recipe. I did cook the shrimp in the butter & garlic (used 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic) removed shrimp from pan and made sauce using fat free half & half. Then set this all aside until guest arrived and we were ready to eat. Then cooked the pasta (used Low carb Penne Rigate) and finished making the shrimp recipe. This worked out GREAT, you would never know that most of the recipe was made earlier. Thank you Mizz Nezz for sharing the recipe."
8688,31562,2005-04-06,5,"This is delicious, Nezz! Need I say more? Your recipes never fail! I wouldn't change a thing to this simple yet very satisfying recipe. Excellent as always ; ) Your recipes are always the best, MizzNezz : ) High Five stars to you!"
188119,31562,2005-04-28,5,"yum yum yum
I have a word for good food such as this dish... simply DIElicious
I call it that because it's delicious but you'll probably die from eating too much of it.. =)
Next time I had better not eat half the thing myself... it is hard to resist though =)
Thanks!"
93006,31562,2005-06-01,5,"Ditto to all the other reviews for terrific flavor and ease of prep...my only problem was that the sauce was a little runny.  I used fat-free half and half, and fettucini for the pasta - I think the spiral pasta would have ""held"" the sauce better, so that's what I'll use next time.  Kids and DH loved it, so it's definitely a keeper!"
132383,31562,2005-06-04,5,"The flavor was excellent but I couldn't get the sauce to thicken up the way that I like so that it really clings to the noodles.  I am sure it was just me, and we will definitely be making this again!"
176615,31562,2005-06-04,5,"Delish! I used fat free half and half, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Had no problems with the sauce, it thickened up very nicely and was very creamy and flavorful. Next time, I'll increase the garlic to 1 1/2 T, just personal preference, and add a bit of salt if unsalted butter is used. Thanks, MizzNezz, for sharing your recipe!"
158086,31562,2005-06-07,5,Might as well add my review to the long list...Got back from NH and brought back a bunch of lobster with me...made this with lobster and it was great!
18391,31562,2005-06-21,5,Another excellent recipe MizzNezz! I love how all your recipes are simple to make with outstanding results! Thank you so much for sharing! My husband thanks you as well :)
146486,31562,2005-07-29,5,"Awesome!  We had this for dinner last night and it was delicious.  Used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 so the sauce didn't thicken up as it should, but the taste was still wonderful.  Served with garlic cheese biscuits for a complete meal.  "
128473,31562,2005-11-17,5,"Thank you so much for sharing MizzNezz. Once again your recipe rocks. I love trying your dishes I am never disappointed. I loved the flavour of the shrimp, the ease of the sauce, it was so good and so easy. I used 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup 1% milk with great results. I also added 2 finely sliced shallots and used jumbo shrimps. A new family favourite. "
40961,31562,2006-11-05,5,"As is often the case I was drawn to this recipe by the photo. Lucky for me, easy to prepare, looked great, smelled great and was delicious. I doubled everything except the black and red pepper, used Shell shaped pasta and light cream because I forgot to buy half and half. The sauce didn't thicken but that was no problem because we mopped it up with  italian bread. 5 stars plus for a recipe that I plan to make often. So nice of you to share it."
140132,31562,2008-01-06,4,"Very good.  We love shrimp and this is a great addition to our ""shrimp"" meals.  The sauce to this pasta is delicious.  I served this with a tossed salad and garlic bread....perfect.    Stephanie"
44383,31562,2008-03-29,5,"Just had this for dinner tonight and it was great!  Too much for just 2 people and I doubt the shrimp would reheat tomorrow but DH and I both thoroughly enjoyed it tonight.  Only change was I added a ""bit"" more red pepper because we like a kick and took the add salt advice by a previous reviewer as well.  Great recipe that I'll be doing again for sure. Thanks"
58836,31562,2008-08-09,5,"Whipped this up tonight for supper.  It was very good and oh so easy.  I didn't have half and half so just used 2% milk and angel hair pasta.  Didn't use as much shrimp as it called for but it turned out really good.  Thanks, I'm sure I will make again."
355637,31562,2008-08-13,3,"This was okay, but it could have used a little more flavor."
377039,31562,2008-09-12,0,"I'm not giving a star rating because I more or less used this recipe as ""inspiration"", LOL!  This looked SOOOO good, but I didn't have any of the right ingredients, so I substituted my heart out and ended up with a hearty, tasty meal (that would probably have been even better if made properly).  I had the teensy precooked salad shrimp; I subbed a cup of 2% milk for the 2 cups half&half; I added a bit of flour as thickener (it wasn't thickening, with my substitutions), I used dried basil and added a tablespoon or so of dried parsley as well; and finally I used a mixture of cheeses instead of parmesan, which I was out of.

Believe it or not, it was STILL pretty darn good -- I'd have given my butchered version 3 or 4 stars (Average to Good). I'd be willing to bet that, properly made, this is a five star recipe -- and I don't give five stars lightly.

Thanks for another winner, MizzNezz!"
74281,31562,2009-01-24,5,Another fabulous and easy recipe from MizzNezz. This dish is very rich and delicious. I doubled the recipe and used 3 cups of heavy cream and about 2 lbs of shrimp. I used 1 box of Dreamfield's linguini to cut down on the carbs which made this way turns out to be about 7.5 grams of digestible carbs a serving.
222433,31562,2009-03-21,4,"My family said this was a good recipe(I can't eat shrimp). I used a little less garlic so my picky daughter would eat it. I also used some pre-cooked and cleaned frozen shrimp from Costco. I let them thaw, rolled them around in the hot garlic butter for a minute and them removed them. Turned out beautifully!"
64203,31562,2009-05-20,5,Very easy with ingredients most people usually have on hand. Came together quick and was very tasty!
173579,31562,2009-05-27,5,This was a very tasty meal.  My whole family just raved over it.  So quick and easy.  Can't beat that!  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.
318235,31562,2009-09-09,5,Easy delicious gourmet meal in minutes. Couldn't get any easier. I used two garlic cloves and might add another clove next time around. Will definitely make again.
242484,31562,2009-09-11,5,Wow!  Delectable!  A for-sure do again!  My picky teen couldn't stop eating it.  I did use 1/2 c parmesan.
231054,31562,2009-10-01,5,"EXCELLENT!  We really enjoyed this. Since it was just myself and my husband, I cut back on the recipe. But I still hung in there with a pound of shrimp. I found some beautiful, large prawns and they were perfect. Also, after reading some of the other reviews, I stuck with the full 1/4 c. parmesan even though I halved the other ingredients. I was glad I did -- in fact, I even added a couple more tablespoons of the parm. This is just too good to mess with adding cornstarch as a thickener!!! Thank you for a marvelous recipe."
439797,31562,2010-01-15,5,"This was really good.  I didn't have any cream, so I used milk and cream cheese.  My husband says it's a keeper!"
1506604,31562,2010-05-10,5,"Yumm, I see that others had a hard time thickening the sauce but i had no problem. Very good but needs a vegetable to balance it out :D and you're going to have to season it to taste with salt and parsley."
43083,31562,2012-06-09,4,I made this for dinner tonight. Very tasty shrimp but the sauce on the pasta was a bit bland. I had to add some seasoning. Super simple to make however. Thx for sharing!
39835,96475,2004-10-11,5,Delicious! This is the first time I attempted hamburger buns and they were so much better than store-bought. Actually I had my ds make these on a rainy no-school day and it was the perfect day to make these. Although this time we made 9 buns next time I think we'll make 12 -- to have smaller buns. Thanks for sharing this keeper recipe!
89831,96475,2004-11-15,5,"Just wonderful Dorel! I whipped these up on my Zojirushi bread machine, added an extra 1/2 tsp salt, and used 2-1/4 tsp bread machine yeast. Set to the dough cycle, removed the dough and rested it for 10 minutes before shaping.
They turned out delicious with a nice light texture. I'll be making these again, thank you so much for sharing Dorel, great recipe!...Kitten:)"
64203,96475,2005-02-13,5,"What can I say about this great recipe that hasn't already been said. I used this recipe for hamburger buns and they turned out perfectly! I had to add just a bit more milk to mine after it was in the ABM for a few minutes. These rose up nicely and make very good, tender and fluffy buns. At 14 minutes, mine were perfectly browned and ready to be taken out of the oven, so be sure to keep your eye on them while they are cooking.
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! These buns are good! :)"
29782,96475,2005-03-07,5,"This recipe tops way over a rating 5star. I made hamburger buns and they turned out the perfect.  I also warmed my milk before adding to my bread machine. I used bread flour and 1/4c. sugar. I was surpised when I opened the door to get dough out, it had risen over top of bread holder. LOL   DH was amazed at how good they were and told me he was so glad I found a recipe to make homemade buns. LOL
I will for sure be making this recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing this recipe Dorel!!"
172369,96475,2005-04-15,5,"I really enjoyed making these, my family loved them, although I got teased, no one here in ohio has ever heard of anyone making their own hamburger buns."
18391,96475,2005-06-01,5,"Excellent!! I made hot dog buns and rolls .. I added a little water as my flour is dry .. I will use this recipe from now on for buns, they were better than store bought! Thanks!!"
160974,96475,2005-06-06,5,"I'd admired these photos for awhile, and just had the occasion to make hamburger rolls myself. I warmed the milk (skim) with the sugar (heaping 1/4 cup-perfect amount and not too sweet). One new trick I  discovered was to use my large muffin top pan (made 6) and baked the remaining 3 on my greased cookie sheet. I brushed with butter before baking and sprinkled with sesame seeds (although without egg yolk the seeds didn't stick as well). I recommend the brushing with butter, since my buns were stored for several hours uncovered and had the best texture ever (reminded me of potato bread). My dinner guests were ""wowed"" and said it was the best hamburger they had ever had. I will be making these from now on. I just couldn't go back to store bought!

Roxygirl in Colo."
51011,96475,2005-06-11,5,Today I made hamburger buns using this recipe (although we ended up eating them like rolls)  I found that I also had to add more milk when it started mixing in my bread maker. I also only put in 1/8 a cup of sugar.  Thanks so much for such a simple recipe!
88099,96475,2005-08-03,5,"These were wonderful.  What a wonderful recipe.  I did add a little extra milk, a 1/2 tsp extra of salt and only 2 1/2 tbls of sugar and warmed the milk before adding to the BM, after reading all the reviews.  Don't underestimate the size of these buns, mine turned out huge, but I only make 8 hamburger buns.  Thanks Dorel for a great recipe.  "
188119,96475,2005-12-18,5,"Wow, they came out pretty good.  I made hamburger buns and by doubling the recipe I came out with around 15 buns.  Thanks!"
176615,96475,2006-05-30,5,"Great recipe! I made hamburger buns, using half unbleached all purpose flour and half white whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup sugar which worked well. Can't wait to try these as hot dog buns and cinnamon rolls. Dough was very easy to work with and result was tender but stood up well and held together when used with a burger. Super easy with the bread machine doing the work. This is one of those recipes that is better with experience. I took ""thickness of a pancake"" just a little too literally. Mine were very large and rather flat even though they did rise very well. Also, when I baked mine on the top rack, they did brown a bit too quickly. Not a problem with the recipe, just the chef LOL and next time I'll know. There will be a next time! I'll definitely try them again. Thanks, Dorel, for sharing your recipe!"
52125,96475,2006-06-10,5,"Excellent burger buns, not only did they look great, they tasted awesome! Thanks a whole lots for posting a wonderful recipe Doral...."
55578,96475,2006-07-27,5,Excellent!  It's so rewarding to eat something that's not full of ingredients that no one can  say.
255338,96475,2006-09-12,5,There really is no need to tweak this recipe at all. I made mine with my stand mixer  with no problems at all. Buns were soft and not sweet as hamburgers funs should be. Thank you for posting.
222970,96475,2006-10-14,5,Good recipe. I used bread flour and part whole white wheat flour and they turned out very nicely. They actually had a commercial look and taste to them!
93006,96475,2007-01-14,5,"This is a wonderful ""bun"" recipe.  Made a smaller size, so that we could use with ham for ""appetizer"" size buns.  Can't wait to make hamburger buns with this recipe.  Very tasty, my dd's even liked them plain."
203111,96475,2007-03-12,5,"Wish you all could see my big, beautiful buns! LOL!  Seriously, these are huge. Changes I made: warm water in place of milk, then added 3 Tbls. dry non-dairy creamer to the dry ingredients.  Reduced sugar to 2 Tbls. and, except for 3/4 c. I used bread flour. Substituted Smart Balance oil for the veg oil and regular yeast for the bread machine yeast.  Next time I'll make 12 hamburger buns instead of 9, as they are bigger than I needed.
Great buns, tho, and very easy to make."
350750,96475,2007-04-17,5,This recipe rocks! I've made hot dog and hamburger buns and love the results.
125640,96475,2007-12-19,4,"I've made both dinner rolls and hamburger buns out of this. I checked the dinner rolls at 15 minutes and they were already a bit overdone, so when I made the hamburger buns I checked them at 13 minutes and they were already done. I used 1/4 cup sugar both times and that was just about right for us. We thought the dinner rolls were really good. The flavor was right for the hamburger buns, but the texture seemed a bit off. I'd also make them smaller, if I use this recipe for burger buns again. Dividing it into 9 buns made for very large buns. Thanks for sharing."
189616,96475,2008-01-11,5,Was my family shocked that I made burger buns from scratch! I really don't think I could go back to buying the supermarket version again. Did use bread machine flour instead of all-purpose since that it was my bread machine recommends.
252816,96475,2008-04-05,5,I will never buy hamberger or hot dog buns again..We really liked these. More flavor and nice texture. Did not break apart or fall apart like some store bought buns..I made 9 hot dog and 4 hamberger buns..I brushed the tops with butter and sprinkles sesame seeds over the hamberger buns..Thank U for this great recipe...
187373,96475,2008-05-08,4,"Good recipe! I decided that I wanted to try to make my own hamburger buns, but then realized after I started making that I didn't have time for the 2nd rising before I had to leave, so I shaped them and put them in the fridge.  But by the time I took them out, they didn't rise in time...so went to the store to buy buns. So ended up making ginormous cinnamon rolls which tasted great! I used bread flour and only 1/4 cup sugar and thought that was fine.  Cooked for about 25 minutes. Next time, maybe I'll actually make the buns!"
632249,96475,2008-05-11,5,Update:  I made this again today but decided to divide the dough in half to make a few hamburger buns and the rest as cinnamon buns.  The cinnamon buns were great too.  Awesome to have a 2 for 1 recipe!  Nov 2007:  I am so excited that I actually made my own hamburger buns. These were awesome and really quite easy. I am not a great bread maker but even I didn't screw this up. Made lunches with the extra buns today and they were still nice and fresh. Thanks so much Dorel!
377581,96475,2008-08-06,5,"This turned out beautifully for me. I liked the texture. It rose well, smelled good and has a nice mild, not overly sweet flavor. I will make this again. Thanks!"
394077,96475,2008-08-06,4,"Not sure why but my dough came out dry and the bread came out on the dense side. The next time, I will reduce the flour to 3 1/4 or 3 1/2 cups to see if it will come out less dense"
248023,96475,2008-08-08,4,"I was just gifted a breadmaker, and love trying out different recipes with it...  I wanted a multi-purpose dough since I was in the mood for hamburgers, and my BF wanted some cinnamon rolls for breakfast.  I was almost out of milk so I used some re-constituted dry milk.  I used only the 1/4c of sugar for the entire batch and bread flour.  My dough seemed a little dry and heavy but smelled good when I removed it after the dough cycle finished.  I shaped half of the dough into hamburger buns... I portioned it out equally into 6 balls and tucked the edges under and rolled.  They looked beautiful.  I did brush them with melted better before letting them rise the 2nd time.  The other half, I rolled out and sprinkled with a cinnamon/sugar mix after spreading with butter.  I got 9 good sized rolls with only half the batch of dough!  I also let that rise and baked after the buns...  The buns were tasty, just a little denser than I liked...  the cinnamon rolls were also good, not too sweet, but also a little dry...  Good multi-purpose dough, but I might try another to find one we love..."
1269015,96475,2010-11-29,4,"I made cinnamon rolls, and they were really good. I love those sweet Hawaiian dinner rolls and this dough kind of reminded me of them. Definitely a keeper recipe, thanks for sharing!"
928301,96475,2011-03-19,5,"I used 2 percent milk & it wasn't missing anything.  It smelled so delicious and made excellent sandwich bread, I just baked as directed for the hamburgers.  I just wish it would keep its freshness longer because I want to make the full recipe but I don't want to be eating that many sandwiches each week.  I guess I'll look into freezing them.  I'm certainly going to be using this recipe frequently."
110078,96475,2011-09-21,5,"I am still a noob at making any type of dough/bread.  I decided to use this recipe for my second attempt at cinnamon rolls.  I do not have a bread machine so, I did everything by hand.  As if this recipe needs anymore praise... they were simply amazing!  My friend said they were better than her mothers and my kids had three a piece!  They were huge cinnamon rolls; I made a dozen.  I used brown sugar and cinnamon for the sugar mix and a light sugar glaze.  They were so beautiful and delicious!  I wish they had lasted long enough for a picture.  I can't wait to try this recipe for everything else it can make.  Thanks for making a bread maker out of me Dorel!"
789516,96475,2012-01-19,5,"I made hot dog buns using 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 all purpose flour and they turned out great!  Can't believe how much they look like store bought, only they taste so much better.  Can't wait to try the cinnamon bun version:)"
132383,96475,2014-02-22,5,"I am rating this for the cinnamon rolls.  My daughter is allergic to eggs and soy, and I was looking for a hamburger bun recipe suitable for her.  I saw this recipe and while I am going to make the hamburger buns, I immediately wanted to make the cinnamon rolls.  I had previously been unsuccessful in finding a cinnamon roll recipe that didn&#039;t have eggs (that I felt compelled to make).  I got my bread machine out last night as my husband was cooking dinner.  I warmed the milk to about 110 degrees and then proceeded with adding the rest of the ingredients.  90 minute later I was rolling out my rectangle of dough (and very excited).  I spread a half a stick of butter (maybe a little less) over the dough and then I spread 1 cup of brown sugar mixed with 2 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon over the butter.  Patted it down and very gently put my rolling pin over the surface.  I rolled them tightly and cut them at least 1 3/4 inches (I tried dental floss cutting, but went with my sushi knife instead).  I placed them cut side down in two round foil pans.  One pan got wrapped and put in the freezer.  The other pan I wrapped and put in the refrigerator.  Before I went to bad, I turned on the oven light and set the pan of cinnamon rolls in the oven (do NOT turn on oven).  This morning, they were ready to bake when I got up.  I put together a frosting (2 oz cream cheese, 7 tbls butter, 2 tablespoons milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar).  These were AMAZING.  My daughter is over the moon happy (which makes me happy) and my husband said they were awesome as well!"
52543,25885,2003-01-23,5,"Since I only had 3 bananas that were overly ripe (and I couldn't wait to try this recipe), I ""nuked"" 2 non ripened bananas to get the required amount.
I'm so glad I did as it was awesome!!! I will be making this again VERY SOON.  "
9869,25885,2003-02-10,5,"absolutely divine! Wonderful aroma great tasting, moist,and so easy to make banana loaf, cant ask for anything better than that!"
64203,25885,2003-08-28,5,"I am often disappointed in the banana breads I try because it lacks true banana flavor. Well, this banana bread was by FAR the BEST banana bread I've ever made! Perfect flavor, great consistency and easy to follow recipe. I did add a Tsp of vanilla and cooked for approx 70 minutes.
Thanks for the great recipe! I'm sure to use it again and again and again!"
64934,25885,2003-09-08,5,"I had four black bananas and was looking for a loaf recipe when I found this one.  I had to add a ""non ripe"" banana to make up the right amount, but it turned out great!  I also threw in a handful of chopped walnuts!   The loaf was very moist inside while the outside was just right.. not soggy!!  I'll certainly be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!"
18391,25885,2003-09-15,5,Good recipe I will make it again! thank you
93006,25885,2003-09-15,5,"Why compromise is right!  I, too, think the brown sugar adds something special.  It was so nice to enjoy a very moist ""plain"" banana bread - no nuts, no chocolate chips, etc.  My kids loved it!"
104295,25885,2003-09-26,5,"This had wonderful flavor!  I had defrosted all my frozen bananas and found that I had so many I needed something that took a ton of them.  I hypothesized that with this many bananas I wouldn't need all the fat and I was correct.  I used half the fat, and since I was almost out of butter I used oil.  A fabulous flavor and the kids love it!"
8688,25885,2004-04-11,5,"An absolutely delicious banana bread with all that is promised!  I used 4 very large, overly ripe bananas which did not prove to be 2 1/3 cups, so I added just enough sour cream to make up the difference.  I also added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans to the mix. The end result was fabulous!  I knew with all these reviews, I couldn't go wrong ; )  Thanks for the lovely banana bread, Shelley~by the sea!"
55578,25885,2004-04-21,5,Absolutely divine!!!!!
47559,25885,2004-05-24,4,"I made the recipe exactly as written, using four large over ripe bananas, and baked it for 60 minutes.  It produced a nice height and good color.  It's extremely moist, dense, and has a good banana flavor. "
68960,25885,2004-07-10,5,What more can I say.  This is fantastic and a great way to use up alot of bananas.  Next time will use muffin tins.  Will be making this again and again.  Thanks for posting.
35526,25885,2004-07-19,5,"We really enjoyed the full flavor of this bread.  I will add nuts next time but had a guest that does not enjoy them so alas, we were nutless this time.  Good recipe, I will make this again."
128473,25885,2004-09-13,5,"Thank you so much Shelley-By-The Sea for sharing this amazing recipe. We all really enjoyed this moist and tender treat.The overall flavour was intense but not over powering. I will definitely be making this again,its a keeper. I didn't even have to use my MIL's secret for making moist banana bread. (you wrap the warm bread in tinfoil as soon as it comes out of the oven to keep it moist) Your bread was moist all on its own. Kudo's.... BK"
124190,25885,2004-11-11,5,"Very, very moist. Hubby and son loved it. It almost overflowed an 8.5x4.5 pan. Outside was almost crunchy, but center was as moist as can be. It took me 6 bananas to get the amount needed. Thanks! It was really good!"
56087,25885,2004-12-05,5,"Replacing my old Banana Bread recipe with this one.  My 6 year old Grandson, who won't eat Bananas, let alone the bread, has eaten 2 slices.  His Mom couldn't believe it.  GREAT texture.  GREAT flavor.
Thanks for sharing."
49304,25885,2004-12-06,5,"Great, Moist, tasty, delicious banana bread. This recipe will be a regular in our house. Thank you so much for posting the recipe."
146486,25885,2004-12-07,5,This has a good texture and perfect banana flavor.  Mine was done after 45 minutes though so watch the bake time.
37636,25885,2004-12-16,5,"Very moist and delicious! I was actually surprised at how many bananas it took to come up with 2 1/3 cups, since I thought 3 big bananas would do it. (NOT) I was lucky enough to have a couple of ripe bananas tucked away in the freezer (you can save ripe bananas, peeled, in a ziplock bag in the freezer for later), because it took 5 bananas total- otherwise I would not have had enough. This bakes up nicely, although anyone who cooks this less than 65 minutes and calls it pudding doesn't have pudding but underdone banana bread. With 5 bananas, the batter is extremely moist, and I had to bake this not only the full 65 minutes, but for a whopping 20 minutes more, for a total of 85 minutes. The bread does get pretty brown cooking this long, but does not burn (see my pic). If one is concerned, they might think to shield the top of the bread with foil, rather than serving this raw. I love the flavor in this, and for one of the few times in my life can agree with why a recipe is on the top recipes list (<G>). I love nuts, so next time, I may add some of those as well (probably chopped toasted pecans), but will definitely make again, and often! Thanks for posting."
176615,25885,2004-12-26,5,"Beautiful, moist banana bread with loads of banana flavor and a crisp crust. I really prefer the flavor of butter and brown sugar to regular banana bread with oil and white sugar. Used 5 medium bananas and baked for 85 minutes and it was perfect. Thanks, Shelley by the sea, we'll be having this often!"
64583,25885,2005-01-20,5,This is a great recipe.  I did like a couple other reviewers did and made them into muffins which baked for 30 minutes.  They're full of banana flavor and very moist.
140806,25885,2005-02-14,5,This banana bread is moist and not too sweet. The only thing I did differently was added a touch of vanilla extract. This recipe will be made over and over in my home.
222564,25885,2006-04-25,5,"All 190 viewers can't be ignored and I too tried this banana bread. The flavor was truly banana and bread wonderfully moist, both due to high banana content. Very basic recipe but good, everyone can add their own bits and pieces to this. I made muffins and iced them with Lynnie the K's Greatest Choklate Icing. Yum!"
59780,25885,2006-08-23,4,"A quick and easy recipe for banana bread. I threw in a handful of cinnamon chips and made everything else as directed. I did have to put it back into the oven to back fully as it was not quite done after 1 hour, but that may be because I did not mash up my bananas enough. "
188119,25885,2006-09-03,5,very good bread!  I added a tsp of vanilla extract to it also but otherwise didn't change anything.  Thanks!
89831,25885,2006-09-20,3,"This was just okay but nothing over the top special, definately needs more sugar and probably needs some baking powder, it did not rise as much as I expected and was on the heavy side. I might give it a try again with added baking powder and more sugar, when I do I will edit this review. thanks anyway!...Kittencal:)"
135887,25885,2006-10-29,5,Excellent!  I took other reviewer's suggestions and baked in a bundt pan for even baking and added some leftover pumpkin I had in the frig.  Great recipe!
229850,25885,2006-10-30,5,"This bread was really yummy. I made several for a bake sale, and sold them all. We really liked this as well. Thanx for posting a great recipe"
32058,25885,2006-11-05,5,"Perfectly moist banana bread.  Used 3 reg bananas, could do even 4 if desired!  Will try toasted pecans with next.  TY for sharing.  "
207176,25885,2006-11-11,5,I LOVE this banana bread! Used 2 ripe bananas I had frozen and then followed the recipe exactly.  I used dark brown sugar and baked it for 1 hour. Perfect! Loved the texture and nice dark color (maybe from the dark brown sugar) but was nice and moist and held up well to slice.  Served it to old friends with coffee this morning.  Thanks a ton!
199020,25885,2006-12-24,4,"We thought this banana bread recipe was good, but not really any better than any other banana bread we've tried.  We liked it best toasted with butter."
394077,25885,2006-12-25,3,I tried this recipe twice and both time it came out too dense.  The flavor is good but I still don't like the texture of the bread.
140132,25885,2007-01-30,5,"Wow....this was so moist and flavorful that I couldn't stop nibbling.  I doubled the batch and it was gone by nightfall.  If you like bananas, you will love this recipe.  Thank you for such a great bread recipe.....Stephanie"
98919,25885,2007-02-04,5,This one is a keeper for sure!! Thanks for sharing!
40961,25885,2007-02-11,5,This banana bread is excellent. It's moist and full of delicious banana flavor. I baked it for 60 minutes and it came out perfect. Thanks for sharing. Also the photos are beautiful.
168462,25885,2007-02-18,5,Very moist banana bread. Kids really like it with some chocolate chips thrown in. Thanks for the recipe.
255338,25885,2007-04-27,5,What makes this one different is the texture of the crust... it's nicely crisp. Wonderful bread. Crispy outside and moist inside. I followed another reviewer's advice and baked in tube pan so I had no problem with burnt top/sides. Thank you for posting.
229524,25885,2007-05-26,2,"With all these great reviews I decided to give it a try.  The bread was moist but was lacking in flavor, sorry."
187281,25885,2007-06-05,2,"My family, who adores banana bread, didn't like this recipe. I have a wonderful gas oven but after 60 minutes that bread was beautifully brown but rather dry.  This is a good recipe if you like to slice a piece for toasting for breakfast or tea but not to eat for a dessert.  We'll likely discard the remaining loaf and make our old stand-by-- Kona Inn Banana Bread-- also posted on 'Zaar.  Thanks for sharing."
520150,25885,2007-07-14,5,"Very good, wonderful recipe.  I made muffins with this recipe to share with friends.  Big hit, everyone loved them.  This one is a keeper - thank you for sharing!"
111291,25885,2007-08-05,5,"Reviewed Sept. 2005 - This bread has become a ""regular"" in our home. It is by far one of my favorite recipes - MOIST and full of banana flavor. Thanks for posting what has become a family fave!
Reviewed again in August 2007 - this recipe remains a constant in our house - probably the one I have made the most from this website...it has become so well known at my home that my kids' friend's mothers make comments like ""Oh, yeah, my kids love your banana bread!!"""
185926,25885,2007-08-12,5,"Very banana banana bread.  Like others have said it's like a banana pudding bread.  Very dense.  I did not mash all the bananas finely and some chunks remained, I liked the effect.  I baked mine in a bundt pan for 40 minutes until an inserted toothpick came out barely clean.  The flavor is better overnight.  I added cinnamon and vanilla as suggested and I think it enhanced the flavor and aroma."
251917,25885,2007-09-10,5,Delicious!
58836,25885,2007-09-22,5,"Had some bananas I needed to do something with.  Decided on this recipe and I'm glad I did.  It was quick and easy.  I have also made recipe #67256 and it's really really good as well, just a bit more time consuming.  I'm sure I'll make this one again.  Thanks!"
81611,25885,2007-12-01,3,"Good, but bland compared to what I'm used to. I liked the moistness; had a different quality of moistness compared to oil/applesauce recipes, which I'm sure is from the larger amount of bananas. This will be a good recipe to tinker with next time I end up with a huge bunch of overripe bananas (which is rare). I used 6 to get the 2 1/3 cups."
371738,25885,2008-01-05,5,This is thee recipe I use for banana nut mini muffins.  My husband's favorite!
426903,25885,2008-02-20,5,"I was craving banana bread, and didn't want to wait. So the bananas I used weren't as black as they should have been, but the bread still turned out great. Thanks for posting."
174991,25885,2008-03-10,4,Nice moist muffins.  I added cinnamon. nutmeg and vanilla.
59473,25885,2008-07-08,5,Great Banana Bread recipe. I added a tsp. vanilla to it. I only had 4 bananas so like another reviewer I added a little sour cream. Will be making this often. Thanks
92816,25885,2008-09-01,5,A perfect Banana Bread.I did as one reviewer suggested and used a Bundt Pan so I didn't have to deal with the soggy middle banana bread like I do in a loaf pan.I will do that from now on.It took just 35 minutes to bake in a bundt pan in a convection oven.I also added a tsp of vanilla.
80998,25885,2008-10-24,5,"Great banana bread. I made some today with some bananas that were browning. I don't usually change recipes, but decided to add the streusal topping from  Recipe #43509. It turned out fantastic.  The bread was moist with a crunchy sweet top."
315055,25885,2009-04-29,3,It was a little too bland for my tastes.  I added some milk chocolate and peanut butter chips and it helped a little.
350750,25885,2009-01-25,5,I love banana bread and loved this recipe. Thanks!
485151,25885,2009-05-07,4,This made a very dense banana bread- which is just the kind I like! I loved the texture and it baked perfectly in my oven. Next time I will add 1 tsp vanilla & cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to it.
173314,25885,2009-02-20,5,excellent loaf of banana bread. moist and tasty. it rose up  perfect and had wonderful golden color. thank you
218535,25885,2009-05-26,2,I found this to be bland. Not much of banana flavor. I may add more sugar and bananas next time. Recipe #9351 is a much better recipe.
1052873,25885,2009-06-28,5,"The first time I made this it was really gooey in the middle. This time I followed various suggestions of other posters. Used 1/4 cup salad oil instead of butter, used 5 very ripe bananas, 1 tsp vanilla, about 1/2 cup of walnut halves and pieces. Filled 12 regular size muffin cups to the top, 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Perfect!"
768828,25885,2009-07-21,5,"This was awesome.  Like another writer, I too was looking for a recipe that used more over-ripe bananas as I had 4 1/2.  After reading another writer's review about baking in a bundt pan, that is what I did.  Turned out beautifully in 45 minutes.  I added a cup of pecans - perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe."
1133190,25885,2009-10-21,3,"I'm sorry but this wasn't the best banana bread I've ever had. I typically like my banana bread sweeter and I'm not sure I liked using brown sugar vs. white.  The bread was good, just not great."
844554,25885,2010-01-15,5,"Well, I must agree with everybody else -- very moist and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Will use this one again and again. It's so easy, too."
242484,25885,2010-02-25,5,Perfect in every sense of the word!
839492,25885,2010-05-01,5,"Moist and delicious. Made in a bundt pan per recommendations, came out beautifully! I also added 2t. of cinnamon, 1/2 t.nutmeg and 1 1/2 t. vanilla extract as I enjoy spiced quick breads. I agree, it's very sweet, all that ripe banana combined with the 3/4c. brown sugar contributes to its sweetness. Update: I made this into muffins, they're so moist & delicious."
333017,25885,2010-05-16,5,This was a very nice tasting banana bread.  I had used frozen bananas that were collecting in my freezer...so that was a bonus.  I used this recipe in Sweet Jezebel's Recipe #409805 and it was devine!!  I would truly recommend both recipes.  Thanks for the posting!!!
383346,25885,2010-12-02,5,This is a great bread.  I used margarine instead of butter.  I added 20 minutes to the cooking time.  Thanks Shelley :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
91392,25885,2011-05-27,5,"Very good, very easy and almost identical to my grandmother's recipe."
133174,25885,2011-06-07,5,This was made as  per recipe.  With all the bananass the bread was super mosit and even right out of the oven the bread was very flavorful.  I did add in some chopped pecans.  Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe.
132764,25885,2012-03-11,4,"This was really good! I added a tsp of baking powder, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this again."
1581225,25885,2012-06-14,5,Delicious. I've made this several times. It's my favourite recipe to use up over-ripe bananas. Thanks!
97579,25885,2012-08-27,5,Just took this out of the oven and it is delicious!  I did lay foil over it to prevent it from browning as my oven does have a tendency to do that.  It took about 50 minutes to cook.  Excellent!!!
482376,25885,2012-09-23,4,"Very good banana bread. The banana is definitely the star here, as it should be! I loved that it was so easy to put together. I checked mine after 55 minutes and it was just staring to get too well done. It probably could have been pulled out after 50 minutes. Thanks for posting this yummy, easy recipe! Made for the I Recommend Tag in the Cooking Tag Games forums."
251626,25885,2012-12-30,4,Good
64642,25885,2013-05-27,5,"Terrific banana bread recipe...no frills, just great banana flavor.  I&#039;ve made this recipe several times.  Sometimes as written, sometimes with half whole wheat/half AP flour, sometimes all whole wheat.  It&#039;s good all kinds of ways!  :-)"
13796,25885,2014-03-09,5,"Very delicious bread. I am making a third time today and have decided to add nuts, vanilla and a little spice to it."
540346,25885,2014-10-27,5,AMAZING!  MOIST!  DELICIOUS!  I used coconut oil in place of butter and I added some mini chocolate chips.  Wonderful!
126104,25885,2015-03-09,5,"It&#039;s a pretty good darn sign when a recipe receives 860 ratings, and most are positive, that this is a keeper.  This one is no exception.  I had to &quot;bake&quot; the bananas I had, because they were not ripe enough.  This made them squishy and perfect.  I could not wait for the recipe to cool, and I don&#039;t think I gave it enough time, but the first slice was heaven!!!  I put it back in the oven for an extra 10 min. (inside was &quot;oozy&quot;) and that was perfect.  This was dinner last nite, and breakfast this morning.  An absolutely keeper."
1179225,25885,2017-10-31,5,Perfect! I had to bake mine an additional 15 mins.
32772,173314,2006-06-23,5,Outstanding!  I love cooking pork with apples or apple juice.  I didn't have apple cider this time of the year so I used apple juice.  A true keeper.
191533,173314,2006-09-12,5,"This recipe really takes the sour edge off of sauerkraut. I usually have only had kraut cooked right out of the jar- nothing added, so this was a little on the sweet side for me. But I could get used to it! I am cooking for two, but I made the recipe as directed, only I decreased the kielbasa to 1 lb, and cut it into small chunks. It was the perfect amount. In the future, I may try to decrease the juice as well- it seemed to be too much. "
29014,26257,2002-05-06,5,"Fabulous, as promised! I didn't change a thing. The meat is oh-so-tender & the sauce is absolutely out of this world!  DH suggested making up the sauce to use as BBQ for ribs, chicken, whatever - which, YES, I plan to do in the future.  I served the meat on warm tortillas with sides of shredded lettuce and chopped onion, so each could make their own to their liking.
Thanks, MC! - 5 stars!!!"
26512,26257,2003-06-09,5,"Words fail me.
I was stunned that I had produced such a masterpiece.
My husband adores BBQ and I made this recipe in hopes of ""knocking his socks off"". It had the desired effect and then some!
Thanks so much for this recipe -
I felt like a Master Chef for the day. Superb!"
8688,26257,2004-05-06,5,"I've been making pulled pork for many years and this one is a winner! The flavor of the rub is an excellent compliment to any sauce you may use.  I know because I made three additional sauces to try with this pork.  The molasses sauce recipe given with this recipe is excellent.  I prepared this recipe exactly as directed with no modifications. Thanks for sharing this one with us, Mean Chef : )"
64934,26257,2004-02-02,5,"Wow!  There isn't really much more I can add to all these wonderful comments!
I made this for DH's Super Bowl Party yesterday and everybody raved about it.  I found I had to cook it much, much longer than what I expected.  The roast was about 7 lbs and I put it in the oven about 7:00 a.m. Saturday morning at 225 degrees.  By 8:00 pm, the internal temperature still wasn't anywhere near 195 - 200 degrees, so I turned the oven up to 250 degrees.  At 9:00 pm, it still wasn't close to the desired internal temp, so I turned it up to 300 degrees.    Finally, about 11:30 pm, it was ready to come out!    It sure was worth waiting for though!  I made my own barbeque sauce to go with this and like I mentioned before, it was a hit!  Thanks Mean! "
55729,26257,2004-02-14,5,"I used an 8 lb. bone-in pork shoulder, and about 2 T black pepper in the rub. (I don't own a spice grinder, forgot to buy ground pepper, and got tired of cranking.) I followed the directions exactly, except, being an unending fiddler I kept peeking & changing the temperature between 250 & 275. The meat was perfect after about 8 hours, but I confess I didn't take it's temperature. I liked the molasses barbecue sauce. I did accidently simmer it down too much, so it was about 3/4 c. and scarcely covered the meat. It was slightly on the sweet side, but it was my fault because I accidentally bought sugared dates. I could tell that it is the perfect pairing with the meat, but I might still try the pig pickin sauce next time, just out of curiosity. Thank you so much for posting this!"
47559,26257,2004-02-24,5,"I've never had pulled pork before, and after reading all these great reviews, I just had to give it a go. I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to substitute brown sugar for the turbinado in the rub.  It took 12 hours at 250 to cook the 7 lb pork butt - so our dinner schedule was off.  We raised the temperature at the end to speed it up, but that caused the edges to get just a bit too crispy.  Because it was so late, we just nibbled a taste, and saved it for the next night.  Wow, it was delicious the next day.  Lean and tender, and perfectly flavored.  A combination of peppery/sweet. Loved the sauce.  Served it on nice quality buns with cole slaw on the side.  Will most definitely make this again."
95743,26257,2004-03-06,5,Divine made with a 6 pound pork shoulder and half the rub recipe.  Next time I'll make double the perfect molasses bbq sauce.  Took the recommended 8 hours at 250° and the house smelled like the world's best cook lives there.  Thanks.
58836,26257,2004-03-08,0,"I'm sure this is probably very good with the pork, but I used the rub on a beef rump roast, cooked it at 200 degrees for about 7 hours and it burnt up.  I guess I should have followed the recipe as it is written.  Will do that next time."
55578,26257,2004-03-20,5,"SPICY!!!  I made both sauces and enjoyed both.  I like the fact you can leave it all day and not have to worry.  I had a 6.35 lb pork butt and it took exactly 9 hrs.  I ususally smoke the butts, but this was so much easier, and very tender.  Thanks for the recipe!"
37636,26257,2004-03-24,4,"First, let me say that I had never cooked a pulled pork inside my house before (It's something that needs to be done over hardwood in a smoker). Whatever prompted me to overcome that and prepare this recipe...who knows? Maybe it's just that fabulous reputation of Mean Chef. But I did and the recipe cooked according to directions. I didn't make the molasses sauce (maybe I will on some other occasion, but I just wanted to use my usual sauce), so nothing in this review reflects that at all. I didn't do your pig pickin sauce recipe either although I really do recommend that others make that or a similar recipe to use on pulled pork- it's really worth the time and effort. I liked the flavor of your rub, not overly sweet but with a nice bite of pepper. I can imagine a few meats besides pork butt that it can be used on. And I will. The meat on your pulled pork is sweet as advertised (but not overly so), is succulent as well, and falling apart tender. The only thing it missed was the smoky flavor I've come to associate with real barbecue, and as a result, tasted merely of a very nicely prepared shredded pork roast. But it was nice. Thanks for posting!"
4470,26257,2004-04-09,5,"I finally got around to making this wonderful ""Pulled Pork"".Because I used  a 3 1/2 lb boneless leg roast  I watched it like a hawk as it turned quite dark - it was ready after 6 hours-pulled apart and was still moist. The problem was that as I was pulling it apart I couldn't resist nibbling on the dark outside crust, great flavor from the rub! The rub is wonderful and I am going to try it on chicken.  I used nearly the whole recipe on this smaller roast then really rubbed it in - I believe it helps to seal the juices in to keep the meat moist.  I also made the Molasses BBQ Sauce - I really did not enjoy the aroma while it was simmering but the end product was perfect with the pork.  I served the pulled pork on a mini Ciabatta bread with oven fries and cut up tomato. FABULOUS  Thanks Meanie "
76951,26257,2004-04-17,5,"We used a 2 1/2 pound pork roast instead of the whole pork butt.  I think I used too much of the rub as it roast was totally encrusted (maybe 1/4 of an inch) and the rub was burnt.  I scraped off most of the rub before pulling and mixing with the molasses BBQ sauce.  But the pork was extremely flavorful and we liked the molasses BBQ sauce too.  Next time (and there will definately be a next time!) I won't use so much rub or purchase a whole pork butt like the directions call for.  FANTASTIC, Mean Chef!"
60260,26257,2004-04-17,5,"Ok, can I be #seventy something to say YUM!?!  Great recipe.  I'm mad that when digging out my spices I found myself short on paprika and black pepper but the rub still turned out great.  Think I'll stick with the 1/2 black pepper idea for the kids sake.  For those who like details like I do - my meat weighed 6.98lbs and took 7 1/2 hours to reach 197-98 degrees @ 250 for 6 3/4 hrs and 275 until done.  I did let it set out 2 hours before baking.  I made the Molasses BBQ sauce and it was interesting, but not our favorite.  The Pig Pickin Sauce was to die for, we are vinegar people! This made a lot of meat so I'm going to remember this recipe when entertaining large groups.  Glad I jumped on the bandwagon, dh just said ""That was a killer meal!"""
121185,26257,2004-07-08,4,We ended up using a 3.5lb pork shoulder and at 7 hours it was just perfect.  For whatever reason we ended up with way too much rub on the meat and had to cut away pretty much the entire outer portion - it was just too peppery.  The meat itself cooked up soooo moist and the sauce was delicious!!
42720,26257,2004-07-09,5,"I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time using turbinado sugar and the second time using brown sugar.  IMO, both worked equally well.  This recipe produces the most amazing, succulent, delicious pork I have ever eaten.   I followed Miller's tip and poked holes throughout the meat before massaging the rub into the meat.  The aroma permeating the house while it was cooking was my first clue that we were in for a culinary delight.  After 8 hours in the oven, the rub had formed a dark crusty seal around the meat, trapping all the flavor and juices inside.  After cooling, it was easily pulled.  We tried both recommended sauces and we preferred the Pig Pickin' Sauce. I noticed that some reviewers thought this sauce too strong with vinegar. It should be noted that this sauce is meant to compliment the meat so do not drown the meat in this sauce.  Start out with a small amount. I have found some amazing recipes on Zaar, but this one is, by far, the best.  10 stars in my opinion!  Thanks Mean.  "
146047,26257,2004-07-15,5,"I don't know why I'm bothering to post yet another raving review!  I did a pork tenderloin, which I knew might be drier than other cuts, but I was OK with that knowing I could drown it in sauce.  Took about 4 hours at 250F to reach an internal temp of 195F.  Served it alongside some chipotlified ""Old Time Baked Beans"" (#29785) and ""Freezer Slaw"" (#9099)."
133174,26257,2004-08-24,5,"I have looked at this often and I knew it would be good.  It was wonderful!  I followed the directions to the letter, which is something hard for me, cooked it overnight in my roaster oven at 200 degrees.  The meat is juicy and falling apart tender.  I made burritos with the meat this morning and tonight... We have some good eating ahead of us.  Easy to understand why this recipe has so many wonderful reviews!"
101823,26257,2004-11-14,5,"As the other 100+ reviewers have stated, this is an excellent recipe.  I followed the rub instructions exactly, and the house smelled wonderful as the butt slowly roasted in my oven for 8 hours.  I didn't realize that I was out of cider vinegar until it was too late, and therefore made a different sauce (instead of the one recommended in the recipe or the Pig Pickin Sauce).  Our sandwiches were great.  It will be nice to have the leftovers for easy meals later this week."
35526,26257,2004-12-29,5,"I made this with a small pork roast and smoked it on the smoker for 3 hours at approx. 200 degrees.  Pulled it out of the fridge the next day and baked for an additional 4 hours till it was falling apart.  WONDERFUL.  I served with flour tortillas, cilantro, onions, cheese and sour cream.  Thanks Meanie."
37036,26257,2005-02-14,5,"Well, you have lots of reviews, but I had to add my 2 cents!  This pulled pork recipe is very tender and a must try!  I didn't get a chance to try the sauce with this recipe (but I will next time).  Instead I used Stubb's BBQ Sauce.  The pork was very flavorful.  Next time I will cut back on the pepper just a tad, but other than that it was perfect!  Thanks Mean for another hit!  "
64583,26257,2005-03-07,5,I served this on crusty rolls and my husband really liked it.  The sauce is so delicious and the meat was very tender.
103876,26257,2005-03-27,5,"I have had this recipe in my ""Want to Try"" cookbook for several months, but had not had the right opportunity to make it.  I was having 25 people for Easter lunch this year, so decided this was it.  I ended up buying a very large package (17 lbs.) of pork butts from Sam's and was wondering what I was going to do with all that meat!  I followed the recipe as directed, even though I was somewhat concerned about the amount of hot spices in the rub.  Well, long story short, it turned out perfect!  After about 10 hours of cooking, it was fall off the bone tender and very flavorful. The crispy outer parts with the rub were especially good.  I added the molasses barbeque sauce, which made it even better.  I also made the pig pickin vinegar sauce which added a nice tang for those who tried it.  We ate half of the meat for the meal and then everyone took home leftovers, which I considered a great compliment.  This recipe definitely lives up to all the hype and I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing."
91392,26257,2005-04-02,5,"Good stuff.  I made a half recipe of everything to go on about a 4 pound slab of fresh ham.  It took about 5 hours to cook. Shredded very well.  My favorite part was the dried out meat on the top and bottom that tasted just like jerky.  It must be close to how you make jerky.  Served it to French people, who were confused.  Both with the pig pickin sauce, and a tomato based bbq sauce.  Put the meat tossed with bbq sauce on Spanish hot dog buns--it isn't easy to get a cheap white soft hamburger bun in France.  It was great.  I can't wait to have the leftovers!"
53932,26257,2005-04-10,5,"Wow!  This was so good! I cooked a 7lb butt for 8 hours and it was perfectly done.  I used brown sugar in the rub, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I make this, I'll try smoking it.
The molasses sauce was a tad sweet for me (but then I'm not a fan of sweets anyway), but still very tasty.  Thank you for sharing this!!!!"
142367,26257,2005-04-12,3,"Wow!  I found this to be rather nuclear for my taste buds.  It was tasty, but I had to have a glass of milk close by to cool my taste buds.  My husband loved it, but my kids couldn't eat it."
46660,26257,2005-04-13,5,"Delicious!  I used a 4 lb pork roast, as I saw no way I could make good use of so much meat otherwise.  I roasted it at 235 for 3 hours, then at 265 for 3 hours.  The sauce is to die for!  This recipe has definitely passed my 'family test,' so now I can use it at parties!  I can't wait to try the Pig Pickin' Sauce!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!"
47907,26257,2005-04-17,5,I smoked a pork butt today and used the rub part of this recipe and WOW!!!  The pork came out of the smoker falling apart and delicious!  I didn't make the sauce only because I didn't have all the ingredients but you can bet next time I will make sure to have everything on hand!  We smoked it about 8 hours on the smoker and it was just scrumptious.  Thanks for suggesting your recipe over in the grilling forum!
119466,26257,2005-05-25,5,"I agree...fantastic. I doubled the rub because I was preparing 2 butts (about 5.5 pounds each). I roasted under convection heat at 225F for almost 12 hours. I cooked/pulled these the day before. I moistened with the Pig Pickin Sauce before I reheated, tightly covered. I didn't make the Molasses Sauce, but used a different sauce recipe to serve with the sandwiches. Everyone loved it--thanks!"
172369,26257,2005-06-05,5,Great Recipe. I will be making this again. thanks.
173579,26257,2005-12-06,5,Very good recipe.  We all liked it very much.  Thanks for posting.
169969,26257,2005-12-11,5,Wonderful! The only mistake was that I made 1/2 a butt instead of a whole...or even 2 for that matter!!! This recipe is so delicious and beautiful when it comes out of the oven! I only let the butt sit out at room temperature for an hour. I figured that half a butt would take less time - if you are also blond and thinking along these lines.... stop now... it still takes the full 7-8 hours. I like the sauce that is included in the recipe as well.... sweet....but not too sweet! This really is an outstanding recipe and is worth every star it has earned as a whole. Thanks for posting!
229850,26257,2006-02-18,5,"Wow! there are not the right words to describe this meat. I have never wanted to make pulled pork, it just never apealed to me. Was I wrong. I made this recipe exactly as written, including the BBQ sauce and even made the pigpicn sauce too. The rub made me extremly nervous as some of my family hate pepper, and 1/4 cup was almost too much for me to do, but I did and no one noticed. They all loved it! I even made 2 7lb roasts and am now enjoying the leftovers. My fav sauce was the BBQ although some like the PigPickin, the BBQ was a clear winner. This is very different from what we are used to, and I have to admit I had some Sweet Baby Rays on hand just in case ha but sure didn't need it. This was just fantastic. Thankyou for introducing me to a great dish I have been missin."
280166,26257,2006-12-06,5,"Not of course that this needs another 5 star rating, but what the heck...I've made this 3 times already.  I love the fact that this bakes at a lower temp for an ext period of time.  Great as a BBQ sandwich, great as a fajita filling with rice and beans and great as the pork in poblano pork stew.  So many uses...I never think ""What will I do with the leftovers""!!!"
262312,26257,2007-03-25,5,"This recipe is to die for!  Only change I made was used dark brown sugar instead of turbinado sugar.  I let it roast 7 hours.  It was very easy to pull the pork.  I couldn't help chowing down while doing so!  The crust is so tasty!  I was suprised how thin the sauce was.  I didn't eat mine with sauce but DH did and loved it.  I also made the Pig Pickin Sauce, but no one cared for it.  I reserved half of the meat without any sauce for burritos.  Will make this time and time again!  Thanks for the keeper."
222564,26257,2007-04-02,5,"Oh yeah! That was good! Picky DH couldn't find enough words to praise this and is willing to have it anytime, anywhere....
The dry rub is incredibly good. I was trying to figure wheather to leave the skin and fat on or not, since it was baked dry. Decided to leave it on. The bits not covered with skin became wonderfully crispy and tasty, but not dry in the least bit. The bits covered with skin where fattier, of course, but not as tasty. We really liked the crispy bits and I might skin the butt next time, just leave little fat on top. My ""butt"" was 6 lb, as I suppose they usually are. Great recipe, also the sauce was top notch!!!"
160974,26257,2007-05-27,5,"I made this for company last night. I was REAL nervous about the cooking time, after reading ALL the reviews (they varied completely on times). I cooked mine (two 3 1/2 pounds) on convection 225-275 and 300 the last half hour (!)and it took about 7 hours til the meat was roughly 195 degrees. My exterior was so dark looking that I was worried it was charred but it was perfect and the meat, totally moist! My guests really liked it and it was a fun entree for kids and adults. I did not like the barbecue sauce, though, and drizzled a bit on the meat but stopped. The chicken stock and wine combined to an odd muddied flavor. I let my guest sample (to decide whether to use it) and he didn't comment, so I didn't put it on the table. I did quickly stir up the pickin sauce and that was used by most. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for keeping Mean Chef's classic pork recipe alive, Bekah!

Roxygirl"
54678,26257,2007-08-07,5,This was outstanding. I did 2 rolled leg roasts totalling about 9 lbs and doubled the molasses bbq sauce. I found it to be on the dry side which could have been because I didn't use a pork butt or not enough sauce. Regardless this recipe goes in the make again/share file.
39301,26257,2008-01-27,5,FANTABULOUS!  The whole family gobbled these up - even the little ones asked for seconds.  I made the recipe exactly as written - and see no reason to ever modify it. Thanks for keeping Mean's legend alive here.
140132,26257,2008-06-11,5,"Wow!  This is THE pulled pork recipe to try.  This came out of the oven so tender and juicy, DH and DD couldn't quit eating it while shredding it.  THEN.....the sauce to put on top is TO DIE FOR.  I was in heaven!  I will definately be making this many times over.  Thank you for much for keeping this recipe alive, it is wonderful."
81611,26257,2008-09-04,4,"We didn't like the sauce, but the rub on the pork was phenomenal. Every tidbit was bursting with flavor. The inside of the roast was milder (which was good for the kids' sake). Had this 2 nights in a row and still have a little left for an omelet. Mmm."
439797,26257,2009-01-04,5,"I used a pork butt roast.  Started cooking at about 9:30 am and by 6;30 pm, it was only at 170 degrees, but we were hungry, so I cut off a little bit and we ate dinner and I put the rest back in until about 10:30 pm when it hit 190 degrees.  Then I shredded the rest and now will freeze for later.  Did not use the sauce.  The crust is delicious."
879716,26257,2009-05-19,5,"The rub is fantastic. I just pulled the roast out of the oven and I can't keep away from it! The rub makes it spicy without being overwhelmingly hot. I'm not making the bbq sauce this time, but I'll use this rub over and over. Oh, and I took the roast out of the oven after 8 hours. The roast is around 6 lbs and only reached 168 degrees, but pork is fully cooked at 165. It would probably have been overcooked had I left it in to reach 195. Oh, I need to go make a sandwich :) Thanks for this one!  (I just have to update to say this roast is the best thing I've ever made!  Also, because I pulled it out of the oven at a lower temperature than called for, it doesn't pull apart but is perfect for slicing.  The only bad part is that it's almost gone now.)"
937635,26257,2009-06-15,5,"Great recipe but I made two big mistakes making this that I'd like to share so other beginner cooks like me won't fall prey! 1. I've never made a rub and I had a 3.5 lb butt...that I covered with the entire rub...yep, slathered it on, let it sit, slathered another layer on...and then gooped the rest on right before popping it in the oven for good measure. This was a bad idea. This put too much salt onto the roast. But, other than having a very salty crust, the pulled pork was Very Excellent in 9 hours at 250 in the oven. 2. I've never made BBQ sauce - or reduced a sauce like this - so I had No Idea it would take 3 hours! I started the sauce about an hour before I thought the roast would be done, and planned to keep it covered when it finished! So, beginner chefs, take note: Rub your roast with the mixture once and leave it be! AND allow 3 hours to reduce the BBQ sauce :)"
1179225,26257,2009-09-28,4,Very good and easy. I made the pig picken sauce and ended up using my own on the pork (DH thought it had too much vinegar). Thank you for posting!
174991,26257,2010-02-09,5,"I'm embarrassed to say that this has been in my cookbook for 7 years and I finally got the ""nerve"" to try this.  You certainly don't need very much nerve to try this.  This instructions are easy to follow and the results are top notch.  I couldn't find a whole but so I used a 4 pound boneless butt and reduced the ingredients in half.  I used my crock pot and cooked it for 10 hours on low.  The next time I will make more barbecue sauce.  I can't wait to make this for our next big crowd."
15521,26257,2010-11-08,4,"Very good.  My first time using a rub. I cooked mine until the internal temperature was 195.  I didn't want it to dry out, so took it out then. Next time I would leave it a little longer as parts of it were falling apart tender, but others were not so tender.  Used Pig Pickin sauce, but my husband liked it with some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce added on the sandwich.  Thanks for sharing!"
126440,26257,2011-05-27,4,"Very good Pulled Pork.  We enjoyed this with fresh baked beans, coleslaw and pecan bars."
307214,26257,2014-01-12,5,I am only rating method and spice rub.  FANTASTIC!!   I used my family&#039;s favourite BBQ sauce instead.  Very easy recipe.
242484,155186,2008-02-17,4,Really good & so simplistic!
229850,155186,2006-08-26,5,This was very good. My family really liked it. I must admit though we ate it with extra fritos.
185446,155186,2006-09-22,4,"This was tasty, and ridiculously easy to make (even easier than tacos).  I liked the fact everything was pre-cooked, and only required melting of the cheese in the oven.  Such a snap to put together."
59473,155186,2006-12-19,5,We really enjoyed this nice easy casserole dish. I used baked tostitoes because that is what I had on hand. I also omitted the black olives because DH is not keen on them. Thanks for sharing
236170,155186,2007-03-20,5,A fun twist on regular tacos! My DH loves it because of the fritos.
160974,155186,2007-10-25,4,"We served this over lettuce for a tasty taco salad and the leftovers rolled in a tortilla. Thanks Leilani, for posting.

Roxygirl"
95743,155186,2008-01-17,5,"Made Dh sooo happy with this.  I used ground turkey, fat free refried beans, chipotle mango salsa and Taco Seasoning recipe #38756.  I left the chips out of the casserole, using them to dip."
400420,155186,2008-02-18,4,"This was pretty good.  It really seemed more dip-like than a meal, so I made some tortilla chips to go with it.  I didn't add the crushed corn chips to the bottom of the casserole.  Topped with diced tomatoes and sour cream.  I kept thinking it would be good on a taco salad.  I think I'll keep this as a dip and top with sour cream and guacamole.  Thank you!"
218535,155186,2008-07-23,4,This is delicious but my family are not fans of olives or tomatoes so I will skip those ingredients next time.
810787,155186,2009-04-19,5,"I really liked this, especially the salsa mixed with refried beans. It was yummy!"
140132,155186,2009-07-17,5,"Yummy!  I made this last night and it was a hit with my family.  I didn't have black olives so left them out, but will add them the next time.  I served this with salsa, sour cream, shredded lettuce and the chopped tomatoes.  I really liked the fact that I almost always have these ingredients on hand and can whip this casserole up in a flash.  This will be one of my ""go to"" recipes for those nights that we get home late and have running around to do.  Thank you so much for posting."
168462,155186,2009-11-01,5,"My entire family loved this. I made my own salsa, taco seasoning mix and refried beans. Once all those were made it was easy to put together. I decided to just sprinkle a little cheese on top and not use the entire cupful. I put out spicy tostitios to scoop this up with, so next time I will probably skip the crushed corn chips on the bottom as the kids loved being able to scoop up  their dinner. Thanks for the recipe."
126440,155186,2010-01-23,5,I  made half a recipe and was great for the two of us with a little left over.  Used Recipe #50820 for the tortilla chips.  Topped with salsa rather than tomato.
232480,155186,2010-11-15,4,"Very good - not my favorite but I am not the biggest fan of taco-ish items, made for my DH.  I left off the olives as we do not care for them and used my own homemade refried beans, but those are the only changes I made.  I'll keep this recipe and make it again, thanks!"
439797,155186,2010-11-16,5,My husband and three teen age sons ate every single bite.  I was at a meeting and didn't even get a taste!  They loved it!  Quick and easy to put together.
173579,155186,2011-04-22,5,This was so yummy.  We really enjoyed it.  It was so simple to make.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
407007,155186,2011-05-21,5,"GREAT stuff! A great way to use up leftover tortilla chips. I lightened it up by using low-fat cheese and fat-free refried beans, but it was still super yummy. We have tacos about once a week and this was a nice change of pace! Thanks for sharing!"
369715,155186,2011-06-06,4,"This was easy to make and we all enjoyed it. I didn't use the onions or olives because of my families tastes. We topped ours with the tomatoes, lettuce and sour cream. Easy weeknight meal to make."
124190,155186,2011-07-06,4,"Very nice recipe which my husband and I enjoyed. We did not have any trouble with soggy chips. I did drain the canned tomatoes with chiles I used instead of salsa, and I did not add water with the taco mixture. Because I was so worried about it getting soggy, it ended up too dry. Very easy to make, husband approved, and it reheats well. Thanks for sharing!"
879716,155186,2011-10-12,5,Very yummy!  I only wish I had used the chips for dipping instead of as a crust because they kind of disappeared in the finished product.  So good though :)
58836,155186,2011-10-21,4,I made this for a bunch of company and it turned out great.  Everyone seemed to like it alot.  Thanks..
937635,155186,2012-04-25,5,"This was great, but a little salty. That may have been my fault though because I made homemade refried beans. Next time I'll omit the salt and might try making my own taco seasoning w/o it. I added a whole chopped green pepper to the hamburger (awesome!) and a layer of frozen very sweet corn between the meat and bean layers to balance the saltiness. I would definitely do that again, and possible add more. I am not a huge fan of chips, so the chip layer was so-so for me, but DH liked it. I think next time I might try noodles instead and maybe double the beans and 1/2 the meat. Thanks for the keeper, Leilani!<br/><br/>Update: I made these with Manny's Lemon Tortilla chips today and packed them into a 2 cup measuring cup today. Didn't add any cheese to the beans (can of refried black with lime), used Paul Newman's Mango salsa and added 1/4 cup cheddar to the top. it was Fabulous! And not too salty."
839492,155186,2014-06-05,4,"Excellent. Left the chips out &amp; served with both guacamole tortilla chips &amp; flour tortillas so we could either dip or place in warmed tortilla, roll up &amp; eat like a burrito. Served with sour cream &amp; shredded lettuce. Thanks for sharing a nice twist on taco night!"
37779,155186,2014-09-14,5,"I have tried many taco casserole recipes, but this one was quite different from any I have tried. The refried bean layer is what makes it so incredibly delicious. Added a few sliced jalapenos on top. Perfect. Thanks for posting."
198154,155186,2015-02-10,5,"I didn&#039;t put the chips on the bottom.  That way there was no chance of soggy chips if there were any leftovers.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and we scooped it out onto our chips on the plate.  We topped it off with sour cream and some added hot sauce.  Quick and easy to make."
39835,64138,2003-11-03,5,Perfect for busy days! This took me a total of 5 minutes to put it together in the crock pot and dinner was ready at the end of the day--this is virtually a no work delicious supper that everyone enjoyed! This is a must have at least once-a-month family meal! Thanks colorboyswife for posting this keeper easy and delicious supper recipe.
36944,64138,2003-11-27,5,An easy to follow recipe and very easy and quick to prepare.  I used cheese ravioli and did not use the red peppers.  A wonderful dish to prepare for the days you know you just won't have time to cook!  Thanks colorboyswife for sharing your recipe!
59780,64138,2004-01-15,5,Great Time Saver! I did use cheese tortellini instead of ravioli and I used a mixture of mozzarella and parmesan cheese for the topping. This recipe is wonderful and so simple. I also left out the red peppers as my kids do not like hot spices. My oldest daughter is quite picky and even she had 2 helpings!
7108,64138,2004-02-22,5,"Easy, tasty and quick in the crockpot.  I used 1 jar of Barilla Marinara sauce and no pepper flakes.  Along with the mozzarella, I threw in some shredded parmesan too.  This recipe worked out great for our ""busy schedule"" today, thank you!"
38643,64138,2004-03-07,5,This is the ultimate recipe for those days you don't want to be in the kitchen. Goes together in less than 5 minutes and the result is a very tasty meal. I used cheese ravioli. and served this with a salad and garlic bread. Thanks
158086,64138,2006-04-13,5,Love this recipe...I just recently bought a crockpot...have not had one in years....don't know why I waited so long to get another one with recipes like this to try out....
146486,64138,2004-08-10,5,My fiance wasn't very excited when I told him we were having ravioli for dinner (I think he was picturing the canned kind).  But once he tasted this he was in heaven.  We both loved it and it was so easy to make.  We'll definitely be having this again!
59473,64138,2004-08-19,4,"This casserole was very good and easy to put together. I waited to add the cheese until the last hour of cooking. As another reviewer did, I will try it with tortellini the next time."
172369,64138,2004-12-04,5,"Thank you, Thank you, this makes life easy and my family loved it. A little nieghbor boy who eats with us often said this is a ten! I followed your directions, it was great."
13483,64138,2005-04-11,4,I took this to a potluck and brought back very little.  It got a bit sticky and mushy and when served it was more like ravioli mush.  But it did taste good.
189616,64138,2005-09-17,5,"Soooo easy and comforting on a rainy day. I added some cooked ground beef to the pasta sauce to make sure it was family pleasing!
Thank You colorsboywife-"
26512,64138,2005-10-16,4,"It doesn't get much easier than this. Nothing fancy, but good taste. I used Merlot instead of water and added some basil & minced garlic. I also added the cheese at the end. Nice, easy week night meal, thanks for sharing!"
140806,64138,2005-11-09,4,"This was quite easy, but the end result was just a little mushy. I used four cheese ravioli and reduced the red peppers slightly. This is a great recipe for busy families."
222433,64138,2005-12-13,3,Very easy prep. I think the taste would really change depending on the brand of sauce you use. I served it with Garlic Cauliflower #111107 and a green salad. Thanks for posting.
176615,64138,2006-01-29,5,"Tastes great and wonderfully easy! Really convenient for those nights when the kids play ball, as it can be started before you leave and is ready when you get home. The best part is...no boiling the ravioli!! I skipped the red pepper and used cheese ravioli. My seven year-old has requested that we have it again this week with beef ravioli. Thanks, cbw, for a fantastic idea!"
173314,64138,2007-03-26,5,This is excellent and so easy! Omitted red pepper flakes but all else the same>  I aslo sometimes use sausage ravioli. thanks!
286851,64138,2007-07-18,4,We really enjoyed this recipe. Couldn't be simpler. Followed the directions as stated. Will definitely be making again.
407007,64138,2007-08-15,5,this is too easy to be this good! I used cheese ravioli and half-ed the recipe and it came out just lovely. mmm! I'm not sure what else to say about this one except it's a keeper! thanks so much for sharing.
252816,64138,2007-10-10,5,"I used my homemade spaghetti sauce.And another 1/2 cup cheese Was done in 3 1/2 hours on low...Excellent  crockpot meal...My son's girlfriend loves this and makes it often,she is giving the recipe to everyone she knows. Thank U for this recipe.."
40961,64138,2007-10-24,5,"Easy, excellent taste and it's one of those meals that you can think of late morning and still have it on the  table by dinner time. I use cheese ravioli. Thanks for sharing."
632249,64138,2007-11-10,5,My 12 yr old son made this tonight and we all enjoyed it. It was not quite done in 5 hrs so I turned to high for another 45 min.
125640,64138,2008-01-31,5,"Really easy, quick, and delicious. I used a combination of beef and 4-cheese ravioli. Only used 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (gave it just a hint of a kick) and added 1 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt with 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning. Everything cooked fine in 4 1/2 hours. Everyone enjoyed it. Will definately make again. Thanks for sharing."
389431,64138,2008-02-18,5,"This was good! And easy too! We tried to stay pretty true to the recipe but used 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of water, 3 minced garlic cloves and only added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes. It had just the right amount of heat and the taste was wonderful!
I wound up cooking it for about 7 hrs on low and then, had something come up that wouldn't allow us to eat at home! So I put the whole thing (pot and all!!) into the fridge and pulled it out the next night! Added another 1/4 cup of wine and let it heat back up on high for about an hour and a half and it was still fabulous!
I was surprised really with having to take it off and then reheat that it turned out so well!  Just goes to show how well this stands up!!  Thank you so much! I will keep these ingredients on hand so I can whip this up on those days when we need something good and hearty!"
229524,64138,2008-04-19,4,"This was easy for my DH to put together.  It smelled really good while cooking.  As suggested by Mrs. Lumpy he did add 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup water.  He also added fresh garlic.  The sauce had a nice flavor and kick do to the red pepper.  The only thing was the ravioli were to mushy, they only cooked for 3 hours.  Not sure how to fix that.  All in all an easy meal to prepare."
68960,64138,2008-09-03,4,"I have wanted to try this recipe for so long now and since we were so busy today, this ended up being the perfect day to come home in the middle and throw together.  One great bonus was I had everything in my pantry. Today I used a spinach and ricotta ravioli with normal cheese and some fresh basil from the garden.  I also left out the chilli sprinkles and sprinkled on top of the served dish. I found I needed to add quite a bit more water for the ravioli to cook properly.  Thank you this was lovely for our rushed day."
37868,64138,2008-10-04,5,This recipe is a five star all the way.!! Easy to make..Easy recipe..Easy to cook..Easy to follow..What more can I say about it. We had it with Rolls and a Salad...Everyone enjoyed. I must say it freezes well also. Thank You for a wonderful recipe. Hugs
318235,64138,2009-06-26,4,"This was very easy just as all the other reviews have said. I made a double recipe using cheese ravioli. I enjoyed this and so did my pasta night friends, but I think it was a little bland for my taste. In order to really give the recipe some flavor I think I would definitely use a home made pasta sauce in the future, or at least add some onions, mushrooms, and fresh herbs to the sauce. Thank you though for posting this easy way of cooking my favorite food!"
76951,64138,2009-10-31,5,"Great recipe and so easy too!  I assembled the night before and refrigerated until ready to cook.  A perfect weeknight meal.
I added frozen meatballs that I cut in half and made 2 layers of ravioli, meatballs, and sauce topping with the mozzarella cheese.  I cooked for 4 1/2 hours on low.  This will be in our regular meal rotation."
140132,64138,2009-11-06,4,I made this yesterday and it was a big hit.  I liked the fact that I could make in at noon and have supper ready for us by 6:00.  So easy and convenient. Thank you for sharing.
333017,64138,2010-04-01,4,"This was fast and easy to make up.  I cut the recipe in half using Karen's Recipe #26947 for the pasta sauce.  I omitted the red peppers and Italian spices as my spaghetti sauce was well seasoned.   I was in a rush, so I had it on high for 1-1/2 hours, then dropped it to low for 1/2 hour.  The pasta was cooked and hot....maybe the cheese was a bit on the stringy side, but still enjoyable.  I froze the remainder ravioli and tomato sauce for a later date.  This would have feed 4 people easily!  Thanks for the posting!"
529278,64138,2010-05-03,4,"Easy, tasty, fast, and a one-pot meal.  Does it get better?  Going to try with tortellini next."
2041603,64138,2011-10-27,3,Not a fan. Maybe it was the ravioli? It definitely needed stirring up because putting the cheese on top of the spices just makes one big layer of spicy cheese. This just didn't work for us.
844554,64138,2014-06-14,3,This turned out ok for us. I only cooked it 3-4 hours and it still was too soft and the sauce started to burn. I left out the red pepper seasoning and used parmesan cheese.
198154,64138,2016-08-03,0,We thought this was a little on the bland but the taste of this is totally going to depend on the quality of the ingredients you use. The flavor of sauces and filled pastas vary greatly. This was extremely easy to throw together and it was wonderful to come home to find dinner ready. We served this with bruschetta
37636,24088,2003-04-21,5,"Very good! Nicely sweet without being overly sweet. I never went to the place at the mall (never saw one), but this is definitely a good drink for when you're in the mood for strawberries! Thanks!"
160974,24088,2005-08-06,5,"This recipe really got my teenaged son interested in smoothies. I don't make any changes, except if my berries are fresh I don't use as much sugar.

Roxygirl "
8629,24088,2004-01-04,5,"Thank you, Heather!  This recipe worked perfect.  I used 3 or 4 large ice cubes with a little bit of cold water also.  I used nonfat milk.  I haven't bought a Julius in awhile but I can imagine the tremendous savings of making one of these yourself.  "
91392,24088,2004-05-30,5,"Pretty good, I used nutrisweet and Half water, half ice..."
59780,24088,2004-08-04,5,This tastes better than the julius at the mall! I made it as directed except I was out of sugar and used icing sugar instead. Easy recipe and we all loved it--thanks for posting!
52543,24088,2004-10-18,5,"DELISH!! I used frozen strawberries, 1% milk, 1 tbsp of honey instead of sugar & no ice. Thanx Heather!"
36944,24088,2004-10-22,5,"This recipe is great!  It is quick to make. I used my immersion blender. It calls for ingredients I always have.  I used 6 frozen stawberries and about 3/4 tsp vanilla.  I think I'll try using about half the sugar and 1 tsp vanilla next time. You could add any other fruit that you like to it and it would still be delicious. I also think it only makes enough for one serving, not two as shown. (Or am I just a piggie?)  This is a healthy drink that tastes delicious. Many thanks Heather for sharing your recipe! "
104295,24088,2004-10-27,5,"Super easy wonderful smoothie.  I used 1 cup frozen strawberries, a full cup of skim milk (left out the water), and 1/8th of a cup of splenda plus 1/8th of a cup of sugar.  My 2 year old and I loved it!"
176615,24088,2005-07-10,5,"Delicious! The kids and I loved this. I used ice cubes instead of water. Cold, fruity, sweet and refreshing. A great use for fresh strawberries. Thanks, Heather, for a great recipe!"
168462,24088,2005-08-16,5,This is definitly a five star recipe. I used frozen defrosted strawberries and a little less sugar than stated. I skipped on the water as my berries where defrosted and had a little juice with them. Thanks for a great recipe.
37449,24088,2005-10-07,5,Yum! I used fresh strawberries and ice in place of water. Delish! Thank you!
55729,24088,2006-01-16,5,"I really enjoyed this. We used the water, and I thought that it was nice; cool, but not too cold (it's winter here)."
222564,24088,2006-04-19,4,"Yummmm. Made this with thawed, frozen strawberries and used their juice as water. Pure, simple and delicious!"
251626,24088,2006-11-15,5,"Nice...There is no place around here to get these, so these are a real treat. Thanks."
229524,24088,2007-06-03,5,"YUMMMMMMMYYYYY.  Just got done making this, outstanding flavor, nice and thick.  Added only about 1/8th cup sugar and put in 3 ice cubes in place of the water.  Just wish I had more strawberrys to make more.  Thanks so much Heather for sharing this terrific drink :)"
173314,24088,2007-08-14,5,My kids loved this. I put in my slushy express that I got from walmart (14.99) fit perfect.  Next time I will try ice as it crushes wonderfully.  What a tasty quick treat!
248023,24088,2007-08-14,4,"My BF loved this!  We were watching something on Food Network that mentioned orange and strawberry julius' and he mentioned how looooong it had been since he had one.  So, I whipped one up for him.  The only think I did a little differently was to add in about 1 TBS or so of coconut milk powder... It really adds a little subtle flavor( especially for those who thought this drink lacked a little 'something')AND also produced the characteristic froth we both loved.  Thanks for sharing!!!"
111291,24088,2007-09-27,5,"This was great.  I made almost as posted using fresh strawberries.  Instead of water, I used about 6 ice cubes and 1 whole tsp. of vanilla.  I did add a banana and  1/4 c. of strawberry-banana yogurt.  DELICIOUS!! I make smoothies often, but I think this has been my favorite!! Thanks for sharing."
140132,24088,2008-01-08,5,We have been on a smoothie kick and this is by far our favorite.  Thank you for this yummy drink...Stephanie
331557,24088,2008-05-27,5,"This was an awesome drink that we will definitely make again!  I used fresh strawberries, 1/2 cup of non-fat yogurt, 4 ice cubes, 1/4 cup of water and about 1/8 cup of sugar.  This was a tasty treat that we will definitely have again.  Thanks for posting!"
132383,24088,2008-07-31,5,I loved this!  I felt it had a lot of sugar - and that is probably why I liked it so much!  I will be making this again for sure.
58836,24088,2009-05-14,3,"This was good but personally I prefer the one with yogurt in it.  I guess that would be a smoothie and this isn't noted as such.  Anyway, at least I had all the stuff to make."
407007,24088,2010-02-15,5,"This is different, I like it! I used 1 cup frozen strawberries, 1 cup reduced fat milk (no water), and just a tiny bit of splenda instead of sugar (about 1 tbsp.) The vanilla gives this a nice flavor, different than your average smoothie. Thank you so much for sharing - great way to sneak more fruit into our diet!"
131021,24088,2010-06-10,5,"This was fabulous. I've made strawberry lemonade, strawberry smoothies and virgin daquaris and none tasted as good as this. I will make this often as it is the easiest way to get my kids to ""eat"" strawberries. Yum. I did make mine with ice instead of water. I made two batches and used perhaps a bit more strawberries than called for, I'm not sure."
383346,24088,2011-07-22,5,This is so yummy.  I used ice instead of water but maybe only 1/4 cup of ice.  Thanks Heather :)  Made for Holiday tag game
540346,24088,2013-11-04,5,"Refreshing!  Delicious!  Easy!  Healthy!   What more could you want?!!  I used 4 cups of fresh strawberries and didn&#039;t bother slicing them.  I just cut the green tops off and threw them in my vitamix.  Although I quadrupled the strawberries, I only doubled all the other measurements.  I was afraid of 1) overflowing the vitamix, and 2) it being too liquidy.  I am so glad I made that call.  Even with only doubling the other ingredients it was still very thin.  I thought it needed to be colder so I added 1 1/2 - 2 c of ice and blended that up.  My whole family enjoyed this for dessert.  Next time I think I will add a little bit of fresh lemon juice or orange juice to enhance the strawberry flavor."
439797,121490,2010-06-23,5,Great recipe.  I used strawberries that I picked that morning.
173579,121490,2005-08-19,4,"Sorry, but we did not care too much for this bread.  Could have used more strawberries.  Thanks for posting."
172369,121490,2005-05-17,5,"Great Recipe! This great flavor just lingered in my mouth, I served warm with your Decadent Strawberry butter, thanks for a great recipe."
188119,121490,2005-05-29,5,"Absolutely delicious! Everybody in the house loved it...this is definitely a keeper.  I think you're right, frozen strawberries just wouldn't work with this bread.  Thanks!"
68460,121490,2005-07-14,5,"We loved this bread!  I made as written, using a 'baker's mix' of nuts (included pecans, peanuts, cashews) instead of the walnuts.  This is wonderful toasted and spread with cream cheese.  Thanks for sharing this recipe NC :)"
89831,121490,2005-07-24,5,"I made two of these tonight using fresh blueberries, I increased the baking powder by 1/2 teaspoon, as I used quite a lot of berries (1 very heaping cup), and subbed almond extract for vanilla. The bread came out just beautifully! I can see why this recipe has so many great reviews, what a great recipe Cheryl! thanks for sharing, I be making this again....Kitten:)"
146486,121490,2005-08-04,5,I made a double batch of this yummy bread and am so glad I did.  My husband and I both love it and will devour it quickly!
47907,121490,2006-05-28,4,This was one of the treats I made for my DD's graduation breakfast and it was well received!  I made as posted except that I had a terrible time keeping the slices from crumbling as I sliced it.  I ended up with very small pieces but it was still gobbled up.  The flavor was great!  Thanks for posting!
140806,121490,2006-05-28,5,I LOVED this bread. I added the brown sugar for a little extra sweetness. Every bite was heaven. I was delighted with the tartness the strawberry added. This be be made as often as the strawberry season allows!
121185,121490,2006-06-06,3,We are obviously in the minority - but our family of 5 didn't particulary care for this.  I mean it was ok...but nothing spectacular.  The kids simply licked the butter off of their slices and left the bread uneaten.  Hubby left for work and chose to grab a granola bar instead of a slice of this for his ride to work.  It tasted like a basic muffin with little bits of mushy starwberries in it....sorry.
218535,121490,2006-06-28,5,Yummy! Absolutely delicious. I used blueberries in mine. Easy and perfect instructions.
40961,121490,2007-05-27,5,I made this last night exactly as written without  the optional walnuts. It only took 50 minutes in a loaf pan. It is delicious. Everyone loved it and the house smelled great while it was baking. Today I'm going to try it with blueberries. I love all the photos too. thanks for sharing.
240552,121490,2007-06-21,5,This was wonderful!  I made it with blueberries as I had a bunch to use up before our move.  I made 1 loaf to take for a ladies Bible study and another to give to a friend.  Yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!! :)
103876,121490,2007-06-29,5,"Wow!  This is really good bread.  The loaf turned out very nice looking, but I wasn't sure if I was going to love the flavor.  I'm amazed at how good it tastes and I bet it will be even better tomorrow (if it lasts that long).  I used 1/2 splenda for the sugar, light sour cream and no nuts."
158086,121490,2007-07-17,5,"Made this for 4th july bbq and added some blueberries for the red white and blue motif.....was wonderful, everyone enjoyed it."
347822,121490,2007-09-09,4,"Well liked by everyone in the office :) I used strawberries and added a cup of walnuts. Also, I sprinkled sugar on top to give it a nice crust. Took exactly 60 mins. Thank you for a good and different loaf. Updated - I made the strawberry bread with 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts (co-worker is allergic to walnuts) and it was great."
140132,121490,2008-01-08,5,Oh wow.  this was delish.  I love the strawberries in this and can't wait to try with other berries.  Thank you for this yummy variety of bread.....Stephanie
497077,121490,2008-01-21,5,"I made this bread for DH to take for his breakfast and he loved it! He did mention that it was better the 2nd day. I followed the recipe exactly as written, using fresh strawberries that I sprinkled w/ a little sugar since they weren't that sweet. I used a 9"" round pan at 350F and it was ready in 45 minutes. Will definitely make again and can't wait to try w/ blueberries. Thank you for sharing!"
252816,121490,2008-03-01,5,I decided to make this recipe into muffins.I did use the 1/4 cup brown sugar and did up the sour cream to 2/3 cup and added more berries about 2 cups..Followed recipe otherwise. This made 8 giant muffins. These are right of this world..I ended up making two batches this morning..We love muffins and this will be one of our favorites. Thank U so much for sharing this recipe. It is a keeper for sure..
394077,121490,2008-04-02,5,Delicious bread. I followed the recipe exactly sans the nuts.  Perfect flavor and not too sweet.  Keeper.
55578,121490,2008-05-05,5,"Great recipe!  I made muffins. I only had ff sour cream, it worked fine.  I also used almonds and almond extract instead.  I plan to make some more tomorrow!"
59473,121490,2008-06-19,5,"Great recipe, nice and moist. I had a lot of strawberries that I needed to use up. Also some fat free sour cream that I needed to use before it expired. I am so glad I found this recipe. Thanks, it was delicious."
37779,121490,2008-07-26,5,Scrumptious. I used fresh strawberries and the flavor definitely shined through. Very moist and rich. Great with my morning cup of coffee. Thanks for a super recipe.
64583,121490,2008-09-08,5,"This bread has it all - wonderful texture and moistness, and delicious taste with just the right amount of cinnamon.  Made according to instrctions except I used reduced fat sour cream with great results."
229850,121490,2008-12-03,5,"So sorry, I can't believe I forgot to review this. I made this for Mothers Day get together, it was a huge hit !   Great flavor and what a presentation! I was impressed as were the guests, thank you so much for posting !"
142335,121490,2008-12-30,5,"Delicious! My friend just dropped off the biggest and most beautiful strawberries I've ever seen and lots of them. I cooked my bread for 60 min. and it was very brown so I guess my oven is hotter. Next time I would cook for about 55 min. I followed the recipe and used walnuts. We'll be snacking all week, Thanks!"
189475,121490,2009-01-23,5,"This was delicious. I made it with strawberries and used 2 cups, no walnuts. Strawberries were 'buy one get one free' at the grocery store this week, so that's why I put in extra. I'm sure it would have been great with the 1 1/4 cups too. I served it hot with margarine. (Very hot, since I was too impatient to let it cool for the full amount of time!)"
177933,121490,2009-06-15,5,Wonderful!  I had farm fresh strawberries... it was delicious!
184723,121490,2009-07-03,5,"This was a WONDERFUL bread!  Everyone gobbled it up... and it looked perfect, too!  All soft and moist on top... and sooooooooo perfect!  I will make again and again and again!  Did Strawberry this time... can't wait to try blueberry!  THANKS!"
242484,121490,2009-09-12,4,I really enjoyed this bread...it was pretty darn good!
187373,121490,2010-04-25,4,"This was good bread!  I have stuck most of it in the freezer; pulled out my first few slices today and it was great toasted for breakfast.  I don't know that it tastes too much different than the other strawberry breads I've made, though.  Thanks for posting!"
914720,121490,2010-05-17,4,This was a nice spring treat. Made as a Mother's Day gift for my mom. We prefer it without the nuts - didn't like the crunch. Thanks for posting.
540346,121490,2013-03-21,5,"I made this with blueberries and it was moist and delicious.  I used all applesauce in place of the butter to save calories and fat, but other than that made as directed.  It was wonderful and I cannot wait to make it again.  Thanks for sharing."
7108,4957,2001-12-15,5,Very easy & smells wonderful.  I served it in a soft tortilla shell with all the fixings; with a side of Lipton Spanish Rice. I also used Old El' Paso Low Sodium Taco Seasoning & it still tasted great.
37779,4957,2002-09-12,5,"This is an easy and very good basic recipe. I added some minced garlic and cayenne. I served this with soft tortillas for soft tacos and hard shells as well. Just added a variety of toppings--lettuce, cheese, onion, olives, tomato, etc... Wonderful. Thanks ;)"
68884,4957,2004-06-01,5,"Excellent. I used frozen chicken breasts, and placed them in there frozen. I added  a bit more water than called for -- enough to cover the chicken -- and a can of petite-diced tomatoes. During the last hour of cooking, I added some sliced onions & green pepper (that's my pic!) This was DELISH in taco shells, and DH had it in a salad the next day. Sooo easy, so into my regular rotation!"
47907,4957,2005-01-06,5,"This is an excellent recipe!  I wanted to make chicken quesadillas and found this recipe for the meat.  I put 4 FROZEN (they were in a huge clump, too) boneless chicken breasts in my crockpot in the morning, added the broth and a package of fajita seasoning, turned it on HIGH and let it cook all day.  The chicken just fell apart it was so tender.  Made excellent quesadillas.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe ~ I doubt I will ever make chicken for fajitas any other way!"
182624,4957,2005-01-09,5,"This is the greatest recipe!  I put frozen chicken breasts in like a previous reviewer and cooked on high 4 hours - it came out delicious!  I served it in soft taco shells for dinner with some other fixin's, and my husband really liked it.  We had leftovers so I reheated it with a little sauteed onion and made scrambled eggs with it - topped with a little pepper jack cheese - YUM.  Thanks so much for sharing this couldn't-be-easier recipe!"
36944,4957,2005-03-10,5,This is a recipe that you can't go wrong with.  I used three big frozen skinless chicken breasts.  One packet of Mild Taco Mix and one can of chicken broth.  This was so simple to make and was delicious.  I served it with soft tortillas and crunchy taco shells with all the fixings.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe Pamela.
103876,4957,2005-08-06,5,What a great recipe!  I put this in my crockpot before going to bed at night and it was ready in the morning.  I shredded it up (which was so easy because it was extremely tender) and put it in the refrigerator with the juice to have for lunch.  Perfect!  I will definitely make this again.
60989,4957,2006-01-11,5,"This is great: easy to make meal, snap to prepare, tastes is delish, and the leftovers can be used in so many ways. We enjoyed our tacos, and I am looking forward to a chicken taco salad for lunch, and we are now having chicken enchiladas for dinner! I true winner. Thanks. "
101823,4957,2006-03-17,5,Simple and great tasting.  You can adjust the seasoning to suit your own tastes or needs.  I used Taco Bell Taco Seasoning Clone (recipe #105993).  The chicken came out perfect and flavorful.  Excellent for enchiladas.
174991,4957,2006-04-04,5,This is so simple and good.  I will put it into my OAMC.
147109,4957,2006-06-23,4,"This is a very good staple.  I thought it was a little dry, but I will keep tweaking that one.  Thanks"
357358,4957,2006-10-15,4,Great flavor and couldn't be easier!
251917,4957,2006-11-29,5,AWESOME!! Super easy to throw together in the crockpot and enjoy at the end of the day! Thank you for posting!
312577,4957,2006-12-23,5,I really liked this recipe.  I put the chicken in frozen and cooked on low for 8 hours.  The chicken shredded very easily and I am using it for Mexican Eggroll recipe.  Delicious.
121185,4957,2007-02-02,4,"This was a great and easy way to make up some taco meat!  I used 3 large, frozen chicken breasts and they came out perfect.  Next time I think I'll toss in a can of green chilis, a bay leaf, some other herbs...Thanks!"
236170,4957,2007-03-21,5,We made this last night and it was incredibly easy and delicious. It was my first time having chicken tacos and I couldn't how flavorful the meat was. We will definately be making this again.
160974,4957,2007-03-27,5,"I've been eager to try this recipe, since I love having shredded chicken ready for recipes. I was a bit nervous about putting frozen chicken in the crockpot, but since so many others had done it with success, I thought I'd give it a try. I used a taco seasoning by Deb's Recipes. I used the chicken for chicken tacos and it was delicious. Next time I will definitely double the recipe to get a bag in the freezer. I will enjoy going through your ""leftover taco chicken cookbook,"" Pamela!

Roxygirl"
439797,4957,2007-05-14,5,"I've made this twice now.  Easy way to make shredded chicken.  This latest time I just used water and added some barbeque spices, a chicken bouillon cube and some chili powder and it came out great.  I added the chicken while they were stil frozen and cooked on low for about 7 hours.  Used the chicken in tortilla soup and for chicken salad."
520150,4957,2007-07-01,5,"We served this last night.  I had made it the night before & just re-heated.  That way we could try it the night before & I wouldn't have to worry about it the day of the party.  Very good.  I used recipe #2642 for the taco seasonings.  DH really liked it.  All the recipes I used are in my menu ""Mexican Dinner Party"".  Thank you for a very easy recipe that I will made again & again."
355637,4957,2007-08-20,4,"This was so good and SO easy! And it did really make my whole house so fragrant! Just made into some regular chicken tacos... I didn't read the recipe accurately and put an entire package of taco seasoning, but the flavor was just fine. Thanks!"
76951,4957,2007-09-05,4,Family loved it and it couldn't have been easier.  Next time I'm going to make it with the spices my DH uses when he makes his famous chicken & rice soup.  I also like the tip about cooking this overnight and shredding in the morning.  Thanks!
185446,4957,2007-10-19,4,"Count me in as the 96th happy reviewer.  Had to add a bit more seasonings for a more bold flavor, but that's a small price to pay for such an easy and tasty recipe.  Thanks, Pamela."
262312,4957,2008-03-17,5,excellent recipe and it's so easy!! i've also used this recipe for shredded beef chimichangas!! i prefer add a can of extra hot rotel plus use the entire taco seasoning packet. so delish! thanks for the keeper!!
55578,4957,2008-03-20,5,"I love these too easy recipes!!  Something so tasty that doesn't include a can of creamed soup!!!  I intended to make the chicken for enchiladas, but DS ate all the tortillas.  He put it on top of taco chips instead and made nachos.  He said it was great!!!"
426903,4957,2008-03-27,5,"Wow, was this easy and tasty. I used 5 chicken breasts, a whole packet of taco seasoning and 1 can (14oz) of chicken stock. I did not have a full 6-8 hours to devote to this, so I cranked it to high and it took about 3-4 hours instead. The meat, from what I can tell, was still really tender and full of flavor. I think next time I might try adding some veggies in there. But my guests provided me with some rave reviews of this one, so thanks for posting!"
499050,4957,2008-05-18,5,Yum.
180090,4957,2008-09-25,5,I love how moist and flavorful this chicken is! I am very picky about chicken and won't eat it if its too dry so this recipe is perfect! And it couldn't be any easier. Thank you so  much! It's going in my favorites cookbook.
294000,4957,2008-11-09,4,"This was very simple and quick!  I added some extra broth and a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with chiles.  At the end I shredded the chicken, added a little more taco seasoning (just to taste) and some sliced onion with garlic salt.  I will definitely make this again.  I only thought it needed a little extra seasoning but this is just personal preference/taste.  Thank you for posting a recipe with such simple ingredients which can easily be adapted."
124190,4957,2008-11-10,5,"This was good. I felt it lacked in flavor some, but for ease and convenience...it was great. Used in enchiladas, which were devoured at the pitch-in. This is a recipe I would definitely use again. I think I would add some green chiles or use stronger taco seasoning. I also cooked on high for 3 hours and it was all done!"
373817,4957,2008-11-18,5,"Great! Very easy, fast and tasty! Thanks!"
407007,4957,2009-01-14,4,"This was pretty yummy! I loved how easy it was. Next time, I think I'll add a little more spice and more chicken broth - mine came out a little bit on the dry side but overall very good! Thanks for sharing."
140132,4957,2009-03-08,4,I used this recipe for a get together at my house.  We made a mexican themed potluck meal and I wanted something different.  Thank you Pamela this was a big hit at my party.
32058,4957,2009-05-05,4,"This is a great standby, freezable recipe."
316717,4957,2009-06-16,5,oh yum! this was a definate hit w/ the family. so easy to make and so flavorful. i used original mccormick taco seasoning. will go into our favorites file. thanks so much for sharing!
879716,4957,2009-08-15,5,"I seriously love food with a mexican flair and this is going in a permanent file of tasty, easy, and healthy crockpot wonders. I really like that no salsas or tomatoes are called for since the hubby has an unnatural distaste for any tomato that isn't in a pasta sauce. I hit a great sale on chicken quarters this week so I used those in place of breasts. My crockpot was filled to the rim with 5 pounds of chicken and I doubled the broth and seasoning. Really I could have used just a little more of the liquid to cover the top pieces of chicken but it worked anyway. After removing skin and bones from the cooked chicken I followed the advice of other reviewers and put the meat back into the crock liquid for a little while and this aided in the needed intensification of the taco flavor. Awesome stuff Pamela - thanks so much for posting this one! **Additional note:  I used the leftover liquid plus a can of lime and cilantro flavored Rotel tomatoes as cooking liquid for rice.  The rice has a great flavor but unfortunately it is on the greasy side since I used fattier chicken.  I'll try the rice again when I use chicken breasts or just use the combo of chicken broth and taco seasoning by by itself to cook the rice.  Definitely recommend it though!  :)"
43083,4957,2009-09-20,5,"YUM! I have had this recipe in my cookbook for a while. (You dont want to know how long..lol) Well, today I finally made it and Im so glad I did! I usually dont care for chicken breasts as they are too dry to me but with this recipe they were great. I eat low carb and I ate the chicken with sour cream, salsa verde & white shredded cheese. MMM! Q Bueno. Thanks Pamela:) I am going to freeze the leftovers into individual servings!"
333017,4957,2009-10-08,0,"I love using my crock pot (I have 3!!)...but I usually end up changing the cooking time as I find it is not necessary to cook chicken for 6-8 hours.  I must be an oddity, but I like my chicken moist and tender and I find that cooking the chicken for 6 - 8 hours, as stated, it will come out tough and stringy.  With experimenting many times, I started off with 2 hours and worked from there.  For 4 chicken breast, you only need 2 hours...6 chicken breast - 2-1/2 hours cooking time (add 1 hour if the breast are frozen).  I always have cooked chicken in my freezer as it is perfect for casseroles, soup and sandwiches.  I just freeze the chicken flat in a medium freezer bag and I can remove the amount that I want.  Try cooking it at the lower cooking time and see...perfect chicken every time!"
369715,4957,2009-10-26,4,Good and easy to make. I doubled the recipe but only cooked mine for four hours. I did taste them before putting in the freezer and they had a good taste to them.
666723,4957,2009-12-11,4,"I used chicken thighs, and the meat turned out great but needed more flavor and I don't think it needed that much juice.  I would use two taco packets next time and a bit less water.  Good overall though!"
13483,4957,2010-02-02,4,This couldn't be easier to do.  I liked it  but did find it a bit too salty.  I used a commercial taco seasoning and this was why.  Next time I'll use a Zaar recipe taco seasoning mix so I can control the salt content.  Lots of potential for using this too.  Thanks for the post Pamela.
470351,4957,2010-02-07,5,FABULOUS tasting!  I do not add salt to anything and did not find this salty at all (as others commented on).  I added my chicken breasts frozen.  Will definitely make again.  Used this for recipe #60714.  Excellent!
485151,4957,2010-05-06,5,"Made this many times- I love how easy it makes dinners for me! It's a very easy to cook since it's in the crockpot with minimal ingrediants & it makes wonderfully moist chicken. I use more taco seasoning than it calls for, but that's personal preference. It's great in ""Simply Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas"" (recipe #129926). I've used it in many other recipes as well."
229850,4957,2011-07-14,5,"My son stopped in and my 5 yr old grand baby, decided to try it, before I could tell them what it was they were eating it, like soup!! my son added a little cream cheese and cheddar and crackers with it and thought it was amazing!! I would have NEVER thought to eat it like soup! FANTASTIC!"
285039,4957,2011-08-01,5,Excellent base recipe to use in chicken enchiladas...loved it!
47907,97340,2007-08-21,4,We enjoyed this marinade on our chicken ~ it was super easy to put together and the flavor is very good.  I used drumsticks.  Thanks for posting!
39835,97340,2004-08-14,5,"Excellent grilled chicken that is almost too easy! I used 6 legs, split and there was plenty of seasoning. Because of what I had on hand I made a few changes by using onion salt (instead of seasoning salt) and onion powder (instead of garlic powder) and I also added one teaspoon of garlic salt. I prepared the chicken in the morning and just let it sit in the refrig all day. Delicious and chicken comes out beautifully reddish brown. Thanks for sharing this keeper!"
18391,97340,2004-09-16,5,"This is a nice recipe! I reduced the amount of seasoning and my husband just loved it, thanks!"
55578,97340,2005-04-03,5,"5 Stars!! Thanks for such an easy recipe.  My family loved it.  Much better than the 'other' chicken with bbq sauce on it.  I used breasts and legs, doubled the recipe and substituted Splenda.  What a great recipe!  Thanks"
29782,97340,2005-04-08,5,"DH and I enjoyed this recipe. Its going into my cookbook for keeps. I did adjust alittle bit though. I replaced the powdered garlic, with 1 heaping spoonful of  minced garlic and added worceshire sauce and a dash of sesame oil. I cook alot with minced garlic, thats why I chose to sub. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
482376,97340,2007-07-26,5,Oh my gosh..what a gem of a recipe this is! The chicken was moist and had such an excellent grilled flavor. I used the ziplock bag method and it worked very well. I just made sure to turn and 'smoosh' the marinade around so all the chicken pcs. were covered.  This grilling recipe is a definte keeper. Thank you!!
132383,97340,2005-07-31,5,I loved the flavor of this chicken. Thanks for posting.  We will definitely make this again.
28649,97340,2005-10-25,5,I made 16 legs for dinner and had hardly any leftovers.  I don't have any gas for my grill so I cooked them in the oven at 350 for 45 mins and then broiled for a few minutes.  This was  a huge hit in my house and I can't wait to try these on the grill.  The flavors really went well together.
52125,97340,2006-01-21,5,This is wonderful and tastes superb. I also did them in the oven as its to cold outside right now. I will make them again on the grill this summer so I can impart some wonderful smoke flavor into them. This is a keeper. My little one really enjoyed these. Thanks Rita L....
44383,97340,2006-04-29,5,"Great grilled chicken. We had it last night with only a greek salad.  Like another reviewer, my bbq must have been too hot because all my legs came out blackened.  I'm also new to bbq'ing but I will be doing this recipe again.  We picked the bones clean.  Thanks. "
7108,97340,2007-08-11,4,Very good....used bone in breasts.
149363,97340,2006-09-15,5,"Wow Rita!! This is terrific! Just a delicious, crispy skin that left the inside moist too.
This is going to be a regular here, and not just for chicken legs, I am thinking all of the chicken! Yummo!
My Dad was here for dinner and said to tell ""his sweetie"" that her legs are great LOL!!
We all loved this one, thanks Rita!"
255338,97340,2006-09-26,5,"When I read that this recipe only needs 1 tsp of seasoning salt, I wondered if it would work well, but with so many great reviews, I tried it out anyway. Wow, really great chicken, and I used salt instead of seasoning salt cos I don't have any. Baked it in an oven and broiled it for about 2 minutes before taking out of oven. My family thanks you for posting."
248023,97340,2007-04-11,5,"Just delicious and simple!!! I didn't even get to marinate it for the full 4 hours and the chicken still turned out flavorful and tender... Amazing!!! Simplicity is the key to the delicious, crispy skin on the chicken and the tender fall-off-the-bone meat... Thanks for sharing!!!"
329638,97340,2007-04-18,5,"These turned out so delicious!  Only change I made was to work half the marinade under the skin of each leg quarter, and the remaining marinade over the outer surface of each before letting them chill.
These were so juicy and full of flavor- absolutely fabulous!  Thanks so much for sharing!"
461834,97340,2007-05-15,4,I made this for dinner and it was very tasty.  I found it very difficult to get the chicken covered with the marinade using a ziplock bag.  Next time I would mix all ingredients in a small bowl and then rub the paste onto the chicken pieces.  Didn't have a problem with grilling them over indirect heat.  They turned out great!!
13483,97340,2007-05-18,5,"I just bought a new BBQ and have to get used to it.  I managed to burn these quite nicely.  However, it will be done again and this preview looks very good.  Thanks Rita"
371738,97340,2007-06-03,5,"Fantastic!  Simple.  And more importantly, ingredients I generally always have on hand.  I did add a bit of cayenne pepper.  Leftovers were chopped up for a homemade chicken pot pie.  Thanks!"
218535,97340,2008-03-10,5,This is very good. The skin was crispy and the meat was perfectly seasoned. My family loved it.
68460,97340,2008-04-05,5,"I prepared this recipe using a package of chicken thighs, 6 thighs.  They marinated all day, about 7 hours and then I grilled them, skin side down, on my stove top grill.  I flipped them and then stuck the grill pan into my oven, set at 350Â°, and let them roast for about 30-40 minutes.  They ended up crispy, brown and delicious!  We'll be doing this one again, now that the snow is gone from our outside grill.  Thanks Rita!"
383346,97340,2008-04-14,5,It was our first time doing bone-in chicken leg-thigh on the bbq.  All the cooking was done at indirect heat.  And at the end (after 35 minutes) I inserted a termometer to know if it was cooked through.  The taste of the spices on the legs were yummy.  I loved it.  The skin was so crispy and delicious.  Thanks Rita.  Made for Zaar Star Game
632249,97340,2008-04-21,4,"Great flavour and truly simple.  I doubled the oil and was more liberal with the spices as I found the marinade didn't quite cover the 4 legs as much as I would like.  Next time, I would do this in a 9 x 13 pan and just baste the marinade on as opposed to the bag method.  We all enjoyed it, thx."
145352,97340,2009-03-23,5,Really really good!!!! So flavorful! I tripled the recipe for 6 very large leg quarters.
187281,97340,2009-07-13,0,"Nice flavor but was prononced as we would have liked.  I added a few extra pieces of chicken so that may have diluted the flavor too much--what I could taste we liked so we'll try again.  Just note, that you might need to double the marinade which is so easily done."
140132,97340,2009-09-24,5,"We absolutely loved this chicken.  I used drumsticks and let it marinate for 3 hours.  It didn't take as long for the chicken to cook.  We will make these  many times, as it is a recipe that doesn't require many ingredients.  Thank you so much for sharing this yummy chicken recipe with us, we will be making again."
189616,97340,2010-05-29,4,"I wouldn't consider this as a marinade, or even a rub, very thick like paste. Unfortunately chicken legs and thighs (fatty skins) are grease fire magnets.  The overall taste was garlic and just a little bit of saltiness. Next time I would  spread this mixture underneath the chicken skin, with hopes it will melt into the chicken rather than getting  burned on the grill."
316717,97340,2010-08-24,0,i followed everything to the T except i doubled the seasonings since i had a large amount of chicken. i marinated overnight....grilled half...then had to bake the other half because it was burning too fast on our grill even on low heat due to the sugar content. for some reason the flavor didn't penetrate into the meat. maybe i should've trippled the amount of seasonings? but i'll definately try it again because there's so many wonderful ratings on this that i must've went wrong on something.
103876,97340,2010-11-14,5,I made a big batch of this seasoning mix today and sprinkled it over 2 cut-up chickens then drizzled with olive oil.  I marinated for about 5 hours and my husband grilled.  The flavor was really good and the meat very juicy.  This was so easy and everyone loved it!  Probably the only change I might make next time is to add a little more garlic.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!
13796,97340,2011-07-02,5,"This is delicious. I brined some split chicken breasts then dried them off and sprayed them with a little oil and rubbed this mixture onto them and left them all day in the refrigerator. For the paprika I used 1/2 regular and 1/2 smoked. I'm going to make up this spice mix to have on hand. After baking the breasts in the oven, I took them off of the bone and sliced them very thin and served them over linguine in ""Geez That's Good ! Lemon Garlic Cream Sauce for Pasta"" by Lisa Gay. Oh boy this was good. My company went nuts over it."
173579,97340,2012-07-25,5,These were just fantastic!  Will make these a lot.  Thanks for posting such a wonderful recipe.
369715,97340,2012-08-07,4,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I only used half the pepper. I lined my grill with foil but the chicken still really burnt. I put it in a roasting pan and then the chicken cooked better.
789516,97340,2012-10-26,0,This turned out really bland for us.. not sure what happened?  Followed the directions exactly.
298447,97340,2015-06-04,4,"Loved it...used Splenda in place of sugar.  DH preferred the chicken made with chucks chicken juice 38399 (only reason gave it 4 stars over 5), but I would definitely make this again.  Thanks!"
49304,44833,2002-10-31,5,We have been enjoying Zucchini fixed like this for years.We also like it with garlic powder on it. Makes a great side dish. Thamks for posting it so that other can enjoy it.
9869,44833,2003-08-11,5,"I had to try this after reading the glowing report on the message boards. I used garlic salt and 4 zucchini to feed 3 adults.
Tasty, easy and delicious. Thanks for sharing."
54678,44833,2003-09-14,3,"Quick, easy but not overly tasty. Perhaps did not season enough. Next time will try additional herbs."
207176,44833,2005-06-07,5,I liked this a lot.  Never would have thought of putting seasoned salt on zucchini.  I used Lowry's since it is DH's favorite. Thanks!
68884,44833,2005-07-12,5,"We really liked this. I have an olive oil mister, and used it to lightly spray the zucchini (I already had some in the pan). Used Lawry's seasoning and a little black pepper, and shaved parmesan. Great flavor, and very easy to make. Thanks :)"
60992,44833,2005-12-15,4,"This recipe is sublimely quick and easy to prepare. I didn't add the parmesan until the last 5 minutes so it would not get over chewy and hard, mine took more like 30 minutes to get done, and my zucchini were on the smallish size. The flavor was good although I think adding a generous sprinkling of garlic powder would have greatly enhanced this dish."
184723,44833,2006-08-08,5,I normally don't like zucchini except to bake with and this was fabulous.  We LOVED the flavor and will certainly make again.  I ate a whole zucchini myself! Thanks!
68460,44833,2006-10-17,5,"Quick, easy and delicious are my favorite kinds of recipes and this one qualifies.  We had this as a side to MarieAlice's Caesar Pork Chops, <a href=""/141789"">Caesar Pork Chops</a>.  The chops had to cook for 40 minutes so halfway through I just added the zucchini to the same pan as the chops!  Perfect...hardly any clean-up at all.  The flavor is delicious.  I'll certainly be making this easy side dish again.  Thanks Julesong :)"
101823,44833,2006-11-17,5,"I prepared this with tiny, little, baby zucchini as a side for our dinner.  The Lowry's added a lot of flavor to the dish."
124249,44833,2007-08-03,5,"Easy recipe to make plain zucchini a little more flavorful. It made a nice side dish to the Stuffed Chicken Parmigiana #149134.

Thanks Julesong.

Bullwinkle"
269331,44833,2007-09-11,5,"I hate soggy zucchini; these still had a bit of a crunch and were absolutely wonderful.  I tossed the zucchini in the olive oil, sprinkled with Lowryâ€™s and used shredded and grated parmesan cheese on top (canâ€™t have enough cheese). YUMM!"
60260,44833,2007-10-05,5,"Delicious and so.....easy!!  I just love a dish that is simple and makes the veggie shine.  My whole family loved this dish.  So happy I decided to do ""something"" with zucchini for dinner and searched out this recipe. It was a perfect side for our dinner. This is a keeper that will be used often."
44383,44833,2008-01-23,5,Excellent! Fast and easy and it tasted fantastic.  20 mins at 350 was a wee bit much though so I'll cut that back next time.  And there WILL be a next time. Thanks!
147109,44833,2008-11-05,0,"These were wonderful!!!  I got to the parmesan part and discovered we were out to my horror, so I just sprinkled a little mozzerella on top and broiled them. So good, I can't wait to try it the real way!"
386849,44833,2009-01-08,5,My new favorite way to cook zucchini.  Delicious and super easy.  Thanks!
229524,44833,2009-02-22,5,Really liked that this was so easy.  Served it with salmon.  Made for a nice meal.
189475,44833,2009-04-26,5,"I changed the recipe by using different seasonings, but it turned out great. I never knew that zucchini could taste so good. Instead of the seasoning salt I used italian seasonings, crushed red pepper, oregano and sea salt. I also used the grated parmesan as directed in the recipe."
173579,44833,2009-07-16,5,Quick and easy recipe. We loved it!  Thanks for posting.
389431,44833,2009-07-27,5,"This was yummy!!!!!! Dh liked it a lot!
I made 1/2 the dish with Zucchini and the other 1/2 with yellow squash.  Both were quite tasty, but the flavor of the zucchini was the best! I will be keeping the recipe on hand esp during the summer when we have so many coming out of the garden!  Thanks so very much!"
470351,44833,2009-07-30,5,FABULOUS!!!! The absolute best zucchini we've ever had!!!!!!  I used Lawry's season salt and some garlic powder.  Followed the rest as stated.  Roasted for 25 minutes.  Sheer perfection!  A new regular in my house!
133174,44833,2009-08-31,4,"The squash was cut as directed, drizzled lightly with olive oil and sprinkled with the cheese.  It was cooked in a convection oven for 15 minutes and was crisp tender.  This was served with recipe #264713."
140132,44833,2009-09-22,3,I made these last night but they weren't the hit like I'd hoped.  My kids and DH ate them but didn't want more.  I'm glad we tried them but probably won't make again.
774665,44833,2009-09-28,5,I could eat the whole pan. Thanks!
43083,44833,2010-02-03,5,This was SUPER easy and tasty! Even my 8 yr old ate a piece and that in itself is a miracle! I will make this again. I used a heavy hand when sprinkling on the Lawry's and it didnt hurt! Thanks for posting!
637486,44833,2010-07-06,5,These were so good and so easy to make!  I will be making these for the rest of the summer!  I think I might try grilling them next time.
362983,44833,2010-07-31,5,This was so easy and delicious! A wonderful way to use the zucchini from our garden. I added some cherry tomatoes and slices of bell pepper as well. It made for a really colourful side dish. Thank you!
265954,44833,2010-11-05,4,"This was very good. I sliced the zucchini instead of cutting it into big pieces. Also, I read the prior reviews and decided to add garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper but NO SALT to the slices, and then the grated Parmesan on top. Delicious. I served with a side of warm tomato paste diluted with water and seasoned with basil and oregano. Thank you."
103876,44833,2011-05-03,5,I have made this a couple times because it is so easy and good.  Thanks for posting!
236170,44833,2011-05-25,5,Absolutely delicious! I didn't know zucchini could be so tasty!
53932,44833,2011-06-19,5,Delicious and easy to prepare!
198154,44833,2011-12-21,4,I rolled the zucchini in the olive oil before sprinkling with rosemary garlic seasoning and topping with parm.  Turned out fantastic.
298447,44833,2012-08-26,5,"Wow...loved it!  I had chopped up some zucchini for a stir fry and then changed my dinner plans.  I was able to pop this in the oven alongside the  Recipe #22126 and enjoy a simple, yet delicious meal.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
1179225,44833,2012-08-31,4,"This was a really nice, light and tasty side dish. Couldn't have been any easier. Thanks for posting."
218535,44833,2018-07-27,3,Sorry. The family didn't care for it.
176615,129345,2011-05-08,5,Delicious! Doubled the lemon glaze and was glad I did. Made a lovely dinner. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
53932,129345,2005-08-11,5,I thought the capers were in perfect proportion to the sauce and the chicken.  I used butter and very much enjoyed the result.  Thanks for the recipe!
52543,129345,2005-10-20,5,"If you like lemon, you must try this dish - its outstanding! I scaled for 2 servings & combined the olive oil with margarine. Since I didn't have poultry seasoning, I used 1/8 tsp sage + 1/8 tsp thyme; I was also forced to use dried parsley.
Question from hubby: ""What are those little round things on top?""
Response"" ""Capers""
Comment from hubby: ""Oh ... this is really good""
Thanx Kitten for another repeater! "
147109,129345,2006-06-23,5,"Wow!!!  I made this a few months ago, and could not find the recipe to remember the name and rate it.  My DH and I both adored the recipe, it was delicious!  I did made a few adjustments however.  I actually doubled the sauce and added a bit of butter and flour to thicken the sauce and served it with pasta, it was soooooo good this way!"
88099,129345,2006-07-08,5,Ah Kitz you done it again with this fabulous recipe.  I would not change a thing except double the sauce.  Wonderful combination of flavors and loved the lemon.  Thanks sweetie.  Made for a great dinner.
13796,129345,2006-07-16,5,"Holy COW!! Too darn delicious! This was just wonderful. I doubled the sauce recipe for the two of us. I used two huge chicken breast halves that I sliced  into 4 pieces and brined. Wow... just SO tender and delicious. I also used a bit of cornstarch as another reviewer mentioned to thicken the sauce a bit.
Thanks for a KEEPER!
I think this would be good with a sliced pork tenderloin, too.
Wow...   words just can't describe this dish. You MUST try it.
TEN STARS!!!!!!!!!!"
347822,129345,2007-01-26,5,"Awesome recipe!!! I agree with several reviewers, double the sauce.  I omitted the salt since I was using store bought chicken stock. The capers with lemon give the chicken a nice twist.  Thank you for the posting."
158086,129345,2007-05-15,5,This was one of the best recipes I have tried....I served this with lemon spaghetti #125120 and it was a 10 star meal for a monday...thanks...will put this one is my familes favorite recipes
92886,129345,2007-06-07,4,I really liked the dijon/egg mixture on the chicken. The bread crumbs adhered well and the combo of the seasoned bread crumbs and the dijon gave a nice flavor. It fried up nice and crispy.  The sauce was pretty good.  I think I would try an alternative if I made it again.
482376,129345,2007-07-24,5,"Excellent chicken recipe and very easy!! I doubled the sauce ingredients (because I sure do love my sauce). If you have family members who don't love the taste of lemon, you can still create this dish for them and serve it without the sauce. Yum!"
426903,129345,2008-02-07,5,"If I could rate this dish higher, I would. This was an amazing way to cook chicken. I am a big fan of lemon flavored things to begin with. It is hard to believe it is low in fat. Thank you for posting."
470351,129345,2008-02-20,5,This was absolutely OUTSTANDING!  I was seeking a low fat chicken recipe and decided to try this as it was the highest rated to pop up with my search criteria.  INCREDIBLE!  I doubled the sauce but wish I would have tripled it because I made angel hair on the side and it wasn't quite enough sauce.  My kids both loved it as well.  I added some fresh parmesan and crushed red pepper to my breading mixture.  I also added about 2 tablespoons (maybe more) of capers.  The fresh lemon just made this dish.  I served this with Sherry Cherry Tomatoes from this site with a side of angel hair and it was an incredible dinner!!!  Thank you for this recipe!  It's my new favorite scaloppine!!!
173579,129345,2008-03-02,5,Very good chicken scaloppine.  My DH thought it was great.  We thought is was very tender. Thanks for posting this recipe.
133174,129345,2008-07-13,5,"DH and I agree this is very good.  I had intended to prepare the recipe for 2 and what I thought were 2 chicken breasts actually turned out to be 3.  Once flattened the chicken pretty much filled up a dinner plate. This recipe was perfect for using my warming drawer as only 1 breast could be cooked at a time and the others placed in the drawer to stay warm.  I did double the sauce and only had enough for 2 of the breasts.  I actually needed more bread crumbs and much more olive oil than called for.  After breading the chicken, I allowed it to stand on a rack for about 15 to 20 minutes to set the coating.  The chicken was moist and tender while having a wonderful crispy coating.  The other piece of chicken was sliced thin and will be used to make a salad tomorrow for lunch."
125640,129345,2008-08-06,5,"This was delicious. We especially liked the Dijon and the breading. The lemon sauce was pretty good too, but I may cut back just a little on the lemon juice next time. Thanks for sharing."
32058,129345,2008-08-21,5,"Made some changes, but wanted to review as it was great!"
60260,129345,2008-09-01,5,Great dish!  Easy to make and we love capers and wouldn't make it without them.  I doubled the sauce as suggested and glad I did.  This one is a keeper.
195589,129345,2008-11-15,5,"All I can say is YUMMMM! I had 2 very large chicken breasts and when I cut and pounded them, I ended up with 8 very tasty pieces. Like others, I doubled the sauce, used Panko bread crumbs and added shrooms. The sauce has just the right amount of lemony flavor. Thanks so much for posting!"
371738,129345,2009-01-09,5,"I didn't have Dijon, so used 1 T of regular mustard and added some garlic & onion powder to it.  Still, this dish was FABULOUS!!!  We found it so tasty by itself; no need for the lemon glaze for us.  Kittencal, you've given me another one for my permanent file.  Thanks."
174991,129345,2009-01-15,5,I used Haddock instead of chicken but it was still a great dish.  The lemon was wonderful and the outside of the fish was nice and crunchy.  I did bake the fish at 400 for about 20 mins.  I also added some cornstarch to thicken the lemon glaze.  This is already on the menu to be served with chicken.
135887,129345,2009-02-06,3,Made as directed without the capers.  We all thought this was just okay.  Thanks for sharing
55578,129345,2009-02-13,5,"Absolutely delicious!  Very restaurant quality.  It's easy, moist and did I say tastes great??  Thanks Kitten for another great recipe."
126440,129345,2009-03-12,5,Loved this Scaloppine.  I served it with Recipe #289520 and it made for a great meal.  Very filling and wonderful flavor.
222433,129345,2009-05-11,5,Sensational! 5 stars all the way. My son is totally in love with your recipe Kittencal! I tripled the sauce the second time I made it. Thanks!
26512,129345,2009-06-13,4,"I really enjoyed this for dinner tonight. Made exactly as directed, except for the capers, didn't have any. Not too lemony as some Scaloppines can be. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe."
140132,129345,2009-08-10,5,This is soooo good.  I really liked the egg mustard mixture.  I was only able to put 2 breasts in at a time but they stayed nice and warm on my tray.  I did double the sauce recipe and will do that next time too.  I served this with parsley buttered noodles and corn on the cob.  Thank you Kittencal for sharing yet another great recipe for my family.
620763,129345,2009-10-20,4,Very good. I doubled the sauce as suggested and served with buttered noodles.
59163,129345,2010-01-09,5,"Since we are starting the ""New Year, "" trying to eat a little more healthy we tried this and absolutely loved it.  Very easy to make with fantastic results. We will surely enjoy this again and again."
315055,129345,2010-02-09,5,"This was very yummy, but it was hard to come up with a nice side dish...I tried a piccata pasta, but the flavors were to similar.  Thanks for sharing!"
121185,129345,2010-04-17,5,As if this need another review....but this was so yummy.  Next time I'll add in some cornstarch to the breadcrumb mix to help it be a little more crisp.
188119,129345,2010-04-18,5,"this was really good. I didn't have any breadcrumbs, so I used some chickpea flour instead. I fried it in oven too since I was running low on time. It came out great! The lemon wasn't overpowering at all.  Thank you very much! 200th review :)"
355637,129345,2010-05-09,4,"Very good, maybe double the sauce!"
789516,129345,2010-08-08,5,This was VERY good.  Next time I'll take your advise and double the sauce recipe.  Thanks kitten!
250031,129345,2013-01-12,4,"I didn't read the other reviews before I made this or I would have known to double (or triple) the sauce. Other than that, it was wonderful. I had a bag of Meyer lemons so I used one for this recipe. I used Panko breadcrumbs; I also added capers. Very, very good; I will definitely make this again, increasing the sauce. Loved the flavor and the crispness of the chicken."
486718,129345,2013-03-10,5,"So good and easy.  I will cut back on the Dijon next time as I felt it was a little strong but other than that it was perfection!!  Thanks,"
928301,129345,2013-04-04,5,"I love this!  Most of the chicken breading comes off when you try to flip the chicken, but I LOVE the breading.  May be better with no capers, and the sauce doesn&#039;t translate great to a pasta sauce--probably best to just pour it over the chicken."
653438,129345,2013-08-02,5,"Another winner!!!  Made this for our dinner cutting down on the chicken and using chicken tenderloins pounded down and left the sauce at the same amount.  I did use some panko crumbs with the breadcrumbs and added some capers.  (I breaded the chicken and like PaulaG I let them sit for about 15 minutes).  The chicken turned out to be so tender and DH loved this dish.  Definately an easy and quick dish on a hot summer night.  Served with fresh stirfry of broccoli, cauliflower, mushroooms and onions.  Wonderful.  Thank you for posting.  Going into my Favorites of 2013."
68460,71933,2003-10-01,4,"Good baked potatoes!  Mine never did crisp up, the skin was still kind of soft, but the flavor of the spud was good.  I used super fresh Wisconsin russets.  The family enjoyed finding 'restaurant looking' potatoes on their plates tonight.  Thanks Virginia!"
51011,71933,2004-06-21,5,This is a great way to cook baked potatoes! They turned out perfectly cooked inside and crispy on the outside.  I do not think I will cook mine any other way from now on.  Alton Brown sure knows his cooking! Thanks so much for sharing.
169969,71933,2004-11-01,5,The first time I have baked a perfect potato!!! Thank you so much! The Kosher salt made it taste just like one of the delicious potatoes from Outback!!!
29782,71933,2005-03-18,5,"These were very good!
I have always used foil but now that I found this recipe it will be Oil and Kosher salt from now on. LOL The salt really makes a nice taste and I don't have to add any salt during dinner. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
176615,71933,2005-06-23,5,"Great! I usually bake potatoes at a higher temperature with no oil so was interested to see how these compared. Great directions, I cooked four baking potatoes about 15 minutes longer. The skin came out softer than my usual method but quite good. I loved the kosher salt and devoured the whole thing. No problem with drippings. I don't know why anyone would microwave a potato when you can make these so easily. Thanks, VirginiaGeek, for posting! "
35526,71933,2006-07-07,5,This is the best way to bake potatoes.  Especially if you enjoy the skin as we do.  I use this method to prepare potatoes for twice baked as well.  YUM!
231054,71933,2006-07-11,5,"Yummy, yummy!!!  We really enjoyed these baked potatoes - and will never bake another potato without following your directions.  I don't know why it makes the potatoe inside taste so much better!!!!  But they do!  Thanks for the great recipe.  "
222055,71933,2006-08-05,5,This made me some perfect baked potatoes! Thank you for posting VG!!!
229850,71933,2006-08-11,5,"I roasted these at only 300 as I had ribs in oven, so they were in there for 2 1/2 hours, and they were still great. I also made them the way posted and they were crisp and delicious both ways."
68884,71933,2007-01-29,5,"Perfect. I made 6 potatoes, serving two for dinner and planning to use the others for a baked potato soup this week. The skin was crisp, the inside tender, and we loved them paired with Recipe #67470 and Recipe #133821. I just rubbed the oil (I used olive) onto the potatoes with my hands."
103876,71933,2007-03-26,5,"This was so simple, but the results were excellent!  These were the best baked potatoes I have had in a long time."
180090,71933,2007-08-10,5,"My new favorite way to make baked potatoes! This recipe really is the best. And very easy. I followed exactly as written, but used a sheet of aluminum foil placed on the racks. Thanks for posting!(P.S. This does taste like Outback's!)"
39301,71933,2007-09-09,5,"Yes, this is the only way to make a baked potato.  We've been doing them like this since I watched this episode of Good Eats.  Thanks for taking the time to post this here."
248023,71933,2007-12-11,5,"I usually bake my potatoes using a different method, but when I saw this was how Alton Brown makes his potatoes, I had to try it!  I used 4 medium sized russets and poked them about 10x each.  I rubbed them with some olive oil and sprinkled witht he kosher salt. I don't know what was so different about this method than my other method, but these potatoes were so fluffy!  Easy to prepare and pop in the oven so you can go on to make the rest of your meal.  We topped ours with some butter, cheddar cheese and sour cream... just delicious!  Thanks for posting!!!"
26512,71933,2008-02-13,4,"I've been making potatoes like this for several years. I don't put them in a bowl, I just toss them in the oven right on the rack. I've never had any drippings as I don't coat them heavily with oil, I use olive oil. I use a bit of coarsely ground pepper as well. Delicious every time."
400708,71933,2008-03-03,5,"Thanks for posting mcb, this was great and so simple.  I've always thought you had to wrap in foil and it never made a big differance between that and the ease of the microwave.  But this has converted me, so soft and fluffy inside and even the skin was yummy - the addition of the oil and kosher salt made all the differance.  I'll never make them another way from now on.  This is the only way to go."
101823,71933,2008-04-14,5,"I didn't have baking potatoes on hand and instead used 2 medium red potatoes.  I also used olive oil instead of the canola oil.  Even with the smaller potatoes, an hour of baking time seemed to be about right.  While I am still not a fan of the skin of baked potatoes, Hubby really like the crispy saltiness of these potatoes baked without foil and directly on the racks."
529278,71933,2008-04-15,4,"I baked these and then topped with cheese, ham, and sour cream. They were great, but I kick myself that I forgot to take a taste before loading them up so I could really compare the taste to how we usually make them. We always rub with oil or crisco and then salt with the larger sea salt crystals. I did use the canola oil, as directed, and then our sea salt. I will say that they definitely baked faster being directly on the rack. I had 3 large baking potatoes, and they took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to be perfectly baked. It did make the grates dirty, so I wouldn't do it this way if you just cleaned your oven, but since I need to clean it soon anyway, it didn't matter. I really liked how the larger potatoes didn't take forever to bake, like usual."
64583,71933,2008-04-28,5,This makes a perfect baked potato!  Thanks for posting.
307214,71933,2008-11-28,5,Excellent and Easy.  The only way we make baked potatoes.
195589,71933,2008-12-20,5,"MY Mom and I have had a silly fight over the years on whether to wrap potatoes in foil or not when baking. This recipe FINALLY won her over. ( I guess she had to see it in writing. LOL) Anyway, I have done my spuds like this for years. Sometimes I mix some kosher salt, Lawry's,  and garlic powder in a bowl and roll the potatoes in that. This method produces the best baked potato ever! Thanks for posting mcb."
620763,71933,2009-01-14,5,"A great way to bake a potato. I used to wrap in foil, but not anymore. The skin was deliciously crisp and the insides soft."
189475,71933,2009-02-13,5,"I didn't have canola oil or kosher salt, but I did use this recipe as an idea of how to make a good baked potato. I used olive oil, sea salt and seasoned salt. They turned out great, and of course I ate the skins too because they were delicious. Thanks for the recipe!"
140132,71933,2009-03-24,5,"As the name says  ""The BEST baked potato"".  My family went nuts over these.....a potato!!!  We all really liked the addition of salt around the skin  which made it soooo yummy.  Thank you for posting this ""oh so good"" recipe."
637486,71933,2009-04-05,5,"This was a great baked potato!  I had never made them myself before, and they are so easy to make!  The skin was so good with the oil and salt....I think this might be the best part of the potato!  Thanks for the recipe."
879716,71933,2009-05-09,5,Perfection!  I used olive oil and sea salt and we ate every last bite.  Alton Brown is well loved in this household.  Thanks for posting this one!  :)
486718,71933,2009-06-08,5,Perfect!!  My didn't get as crisp as I liked but I would guess that's because I couldn't wait any longer to eat them!!  Thanks!
1365025,71933,2009-10-12,5,"These baked up really great. I finally was able to bake a potato that was fluffy inside, nice and crispy outside. I didn't have kosher salt or canola oil but I didn't want to wait to try them so I used olive oil and sea salt. The results were still delicious. Thanks for posting this recipe."
653438,71933,2009-10-14,5,This is definately a keeper!  I did as a previous review said and added some seasoning salt and garlic powder to the salt and rubbed it on the oiled potato.  The pototatoes were fluffy and delicious.  DH said make this recipe again and again!  Thank you.
305531,71933,2009-10-16,5,"Yum! These were simple, fluffy inside, crisp outside, and good. I loved the kosher salt on these! Thanks so much cooking_geek for a great keeper. Made for Chef Alphabet Soup Tag."
1122161,71933,2010-02-03,5,"Loved this recipe! The directions were really good, especially #8 on how to open the potato. I never really opened a potato the right way until now! Thanks for posting, this was great!!"
40961,71933,2010-02-11,5,"perfect baked potatoes! delicious with the salt, I didn't even need a topping:) Thanks for sharing this recipe."
928301,71933,2011-07-07,4,"Seems like a promising method.  I used my small convection toaster oven and was unsure how to adjust timing for it.  I ended up having it in there for an hour, but it really needed at least another thirty minutes.  I coated it lightly with oil so there was no dripping to worry about at all."
15521,71933,2012-09-08,5,Just like those delicious baked potatoes you get in restaurants!  This was fabuous and I will be using this recipe from now on!  Followed the recipe exactly.
369715,71933,2013-11-08,4,These were good and easy to make. I used olive oil and placed the potatoes on a cookie sheet. My potatoes were huge so they took an hour and a half to cook. We all enjoyed these.
26512,27520,2003-06-17,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe! I browned the ground beef with the onion and added more garlic and quite a bit of salt and pepper. Simple and homestyle goodness in one pan. I served this with crusty rolls and a tossed salad and there wasn't a bit left!
Nice on the budget, great comfort food. Thanks, Kari!"
189616,27520,2005-08-01,5,"Well the price of ground chuck these days, I wouldn't call it a poverty meal!. We've all made this type of casserole before, though this is the first time I actually did it by following instructions.....The only thing I did different was I used stewed tomatoes with green chilies, didn't find it bland at all! We all enjoyed it
Thank You Kari!"
104295,27520,2005-10-01,5,"I am trying to use what is in my freezer and larder without going to the store for extras and I found a ton of ground beef.  So this worked well!  I used shallots and garlic (as I am out of onions), a large can of crushed tomatoes with Italian seasoning, and a smaller can of diced tomatoes.  I also used whole wheat pasta and added a can of kidney beans.  I served it with homemade herbed popovers.  A very filling meal. "
294000,27520,2006-06-14,5,"DH says ""this is a keeper"".  Easy and very tasty.  Thanks."
324621,27520,2006-11-07,5,This was a delicious and really satisfying meal! I loved the big chunks of tomatoes. Both of my boys cleaned their plates too! I will be making this again soon!!
318235,27520,2007-02-07,5,"Very good, had more flavor than I expected. Thank you!"
248023,27520,2007-08-09,4,I have been making this since my college years and called it goulash... I am in my early thirties now and my BF and I still enjoy this meal with some garlic bread and a simple green salad from time to time.  It is such an easy and tasty dinner to throw together when you really don't know what to cook and most of us have all the ingredients on hand... I love the fact that the macaroni is cooked in with the meat mixture so you don't have to deal with dirtying up another pot to boil it.  Plus it gets a chance to soak up all th lovely juices!!!  Thanks for the memories!!!
137911,27520,2007-08-29,5,"This was super easy to make - took less than 30 minutes.  It also tastes great.  It's like a hamburger helper meal, only better...(less sodium).  I did add about 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning and increased the water by about 1/2 cup.  My 11 yo daughter liked it but picked out the stewed tomato pieces.  I think next time, I may use a can of crushed tomatoes instead so she can't do that.  Thanks for posting."
98919,27520,2007-09-03,5,"As a child we called this goulash also.  I am pretty sure my mother never put garlic in hers and it always had to have a green pepper diced up in it.  I would say that I have ate this close to all my nearly 50 years of living. One pot meal, easy to throw together, great taste and fond childhood memories.    You can't get any better than that!"
298447,27520,2007-09-10,3,"Inexpensive, quick and easy- great for those busy weeknights that sometimes catch me off guard.  For my personal taste, I find the flavor to be a little soft, so I usually experiment with other spices/ingredients to give it more ""kick"".  This is a good, staple recipe to have on hand.  Thx!"
74652,27520,2007-10-02,4,We must have grown up in the same family.  Mom raising 2 small children suddenly on her own found things tight. This is what my Mom called Sicilian goulash .  I still make it when I need some comfort food and this is all I have in the pantry.  Thanks
187281,27520,2007-10-12,5,"Easy, cheap and tasty meal. My family said it tasted like a cross between hamburger helper and goulash. Nevertheless, the picky eaters ate it. I added italian seasoning and sprinkled paramasan cheese to serve. This was a nice addition to help get our grocery bill down. The entire meal cost less than $5 and easily serves 4-6 people. Thanks!  Update: I used one pound italian sausage crumbled and it was very good!"
203111,27520,2007-12-01,5,"Surprise dinner guests on their way so I had to find something to feed them. This was a good, easy dish to make and didn't require a trip to the supermarket.  I cooked the first 6 ingredients together for about 5 minutes, then tasted it and added quite a bit of salt, plus about 1/2 tsp oregano, followed by the macaroni.  Even the picky eaters enjoyed it!"
168462,27520,2008-01-21,5,"Everyone in my family loved this dish. I left out the olive oil and cooked the onion in water and added a little beef soup base. In order to get the boys to eat it, I pureed the tomatoes using my hand blender, before adding to the dish. It is not often I find a recipe the entire family will eat. Thanks for the recipe."
229850,27520,2008-06-21,5,"We really liked this. I did take the advice of some other reviewers and added a can of corn, as well as a can of kidney beans, with one can of stewed tomatoes and one can of Rotel to kick it up ! Thanx for a good fast dinner"
620763,27520,2008-02-13,4,Great comfort food. I used a can of seasoned diced tomatoes in place of the stewed tomatoes. A great easy meal to make with ingredients you have on hand. I use to have this a lot as a child but with a can of tomato soup instead of the stewed tomatoes.
140132,27520,2008-02-21,4,"This was a good cheap meal.  We really liked this meal.  I served it with green beans and bread & butter.  Simple, fast, cheap, what could be better...thank you for posting....Stephanie"
333017,27520,2009-02-26,4,"I made something similar to this when I first started cooking and newly married. (I made it so often that my DH told me to give it a break for a while...this and quiche, lol!!!)  I called it my Clean Up the Fridge Dump Casserole.  Basically I used up all the leftover veggies and cheese I had in the fridge.  I would sometimes added a can of chick peas or black beans....adding tomato juice if more liquid was needed.  Any shape of noodle can be used up.  The only thing I did different was that I added the noodles at the end and turned off the heat and let the noodles cook in the sauce, for about 10 minutes.  This way the noodle stayed ""al dente"" even after heating up the leftovers the next day!   Thanks for taking me down Memory Lane!!"
969481,27520,2009-04-08,3,"If my kids rated this, it would be 5 stars, they loved it. My spouse and I were not too thrilled with this, so I decided to meet in the middle with the rating. Given the basic ingrediants though, this is a quick meal and easy to put together and my kids loved the leftovers! I would make it again if it was requested, but probably not in the regular menu rotation unless we added some spice."
242484,27520,2009-06-30,4,"This dish brought me back to my years growing up, my dad made this at least once a week for us.  Unfortunately, my own kids & hubby didn't care for it as much as I did as a child."
532289,27520,2009-10-05,5,This gets a 5 on ease alone.  When I looked through the basic recipe (I didn't read the directions) I planned on cooking the pasta in a separate pan and then using another to bake it in the oven.  Was I surprised when I went to cook it and found not only was it easy but ONE PAN!  Made as directed except I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  Very simple and easy.  The 4  year old loves it and the 7 will eat it.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.
1365025,27520,2009-10-08,5,"OMG! My mother used to make this back in the 40's & 50's as we were growing up. She would add peas to it. There were 10 of us and it would stretch along ways. I've forgotten about this meal for years but now all at once I'm hungry for it. Guess what I'm having for supper tonight?
Thanks for bringing back some childhood memories."
653438,27520,2010-04-26,5,"I made this last night and it is a cheap meal and delicious. I cut the recipe in half and used diced tomatoes with chilies and 2 Tbls. of tomatoe paste. I did add some frozen corn and velveta cheese instead of cheddar to make it more creamy. I also added Mrs. Dash garlic/herb seasoning, some basil and a little oregano...turned out great. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that anyone can make as is or add to and turn out delicious!"
350750,27520,2010-02-22,5,"Love a recipe that uses everything I've already got in the pantry.  This was tasty too, thanks!"
1133190,27520,2010-02-28,4,"I think my mom made this for us growing up but called it goulash?  It's a fairly easy meal to make but I didn't like that I had to be stirring constantly for 20 minutes so the macaroni wouldn't stick to the bottom of the pan.  In my opinion, spaghetti is just as cheap, contains the same basic nutrients and is slightly easier to make so I'll probably stick to that in the future.  It was fun to try a new recipe though."
55729,27520,2010-03-30,3,"This turned out pretty well. I doubt it would become my favorite meal ever, but it is super-easy and everyone ate it without complaining. I will probably make this again."
50969,27520,2011-02-24,3,"I made this on 2/24/11 for the "" Comfort Food Event ""in the Food Photo Forum.The only thing that was done different to this recipe is,that it was cut in half.Even after 20 minutes of cooking the pasta was still hard and had to add about 4 more ounces of water to get it done.The taste was very bland and not nearly enough seasonings.I'm sorry but this recipe just didn't seem to work for us.But thank you for taking the time to post.:)"
198154,27520,2011-06-28,4,"This was a great solution to the ""I never got anything out of the freezer for dinner"" dilemma I was in tonight. I had everything on hand and it was pretty quick and easy to make.  DH added hot sauce to his."
456858,27520,2011-09-04,3,"This was just OK for me.  I mean it was edible, but I definitely had to add the Parmesan cheese to give it any kind of flavor.  More than likely, I would not make this again."
103876,27520,2012-01-11,4,"This made a really quick meal tonight and everyone liked it.  I thought it was a little bland, but the simplicity was hard to beat.  Thanks for posting."
2549237,27520,2013-02-01,4,"This was really good. It reminds me of a healthier version of Hamburger Helper.  I paired it with garlic bread and a salad and had dinner ready in about 25 minutes. Great for a stressed out, crazy mom like myself.  UPDATE 2/1/13: I made this again tonight and added a can of Cream Style Corn that I accidentally bought and it turned out great again.  I had to spice it up a little because the corn made it bland.  Again I paired it with a salad and garlic bread and had dinner ready in a hurry."
218535,27520,2013-03-15,5,Made as is. Even my picky children ate it.
400708,27520,2013-05-27,4,"A quick, easy, inexpensive and pleasant meal that can be on the table in now time and only dirty one pot; great for those nights when you just don&#039;t want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen but still want that home made dinner.  It was a little bland for our taste so added 2 teaspoons of chili powder and 1 teaspoons of crushed red pepper and that seemed to work great for us."
142367,27520,2014-11-14,4,"I hate the name, but love the recipe. Thank you for sharing this simple and satisfying recipe."
265954,27520,2015-09-07,4,"Great recipe and base for similar meals. I tweaked and made this for one of our Meatless Friday dinners. In place of the ground beef, I used 16 oz. of mushrooms (8 oz. of bella mushrooms and 8 oz. of white mushrooms). I also added a diced green pepper. Since mushrooms cook down and release so much water, I added a 12 oz. cup of water to the dish instead of the recommended 16 oz. Based on several of the prior reviews, I also added oregano to the dish, and was liberal with the black pepper, since the recipe as provided would have been a bit bland for our taste. My last change was to use a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce in place of the two 16 oz. cans of stewed tomatoes. We loved this dish as tweaked and will be having left-overs tomorrow. Thanks!"
1581225,27520,2016-11-08,4,This was enjoyed by all. I do personally prefer a nice slow cooked bolognese sauce/ragout with my pasta but this will be a good option when I'm short on time. I like the chef's idea of adding fresh herbs.
808027,27520,2018-06-12,4,"Anyone that said this was bland doesn't know have much imagination because the addition of your favorite spices, some Worcerstershire sauce, maybe some crushed red peppers, a small can of tomato sauce and your favorite cheese(s) makes this a great homemade &quot;hamburger helper&quot; type meal. It is a great starter recipe you can easily customize to anyone's tastes. My kids tend to prefer blander foods that don't have too many ingredients so I make it pretty much according to the recipe, but I am able to add green olives, chopped grilled eggplant, etc. to mine. Corn and diced bell peppers are also good in this. Great way to sneak in some leftover veggies, too. And it goes without saying that this stretches a lb. of hamburger meat like nobody's business! This one is a keeper. No, I wouldn't serve it at a dinner party, but that is not the point of this recipe."
9869,28648,2002-07-14,5,"Absolutely delicious!
I didnt use the ham as we had Bergys Peppered Breakfast Bacon recipe #27664 with it instead.
It was light and fluffy and easy to roll.
Thanks for posting.  =)"
7108,28648,2003-02-05,5,"Very good and very easy!  I substituted bacon, precooking about 8-10 slices in the microwave.  I did have a bit of trouble rolling the roll but 2 spatuala's helped me along with the rolling, lol.  It reheated nicely, as well.  I would probably add some more cheddar next time and top the roll with more cheddar upon reheating.  I made this mostly for DH who does not care for the mushroom, pepper and onion combo but next time I will add these ingredients, for myself!  Great recipe!"
64583,28648,2003-02-13,5,"My husband and I really loved this!  I added red pepper, onion and mushrooms and used Egg Beaters instead of regular eggs.  My only problem was that they stuck to the pan a little bit (I sprayed it with Pam cooking spray first so I don't know why they stuck) so instead of rolling it, we just cut it in squares and served it that way.  So much easier than standing at the stove making omelets.  We'll be using your method from now on.  Thanks!"
101823,28648,2004-11-01,5,"This is incredibly easy and has a wonderful flavor and presentation.  Tonight, I was looking for a simple meal after a long day.  This was perfect.  I added crumbled bacon between the ham and cheese layers.  It provided great flavor.  Hubby wants me to add sauteed onions and peppers next time.  I served this with toasted English muffins and a simple fruit salad...breakfast for dinner...what could be easier.  LOL  I can't wait to serve this when I have overnight guests."
68460,28648,2004-11-03,5,"I'll add my 5 *'s to this recipe.  I wasn't able to roll it up but that was due to my gimpy pan and out-of-whack oven.  I'm still rating it high because it was delicious served as slices out of the pan and my daughter, her friend, and I had a wonderful dinner with this served with buttered noodles and herb bread.  Hey, it worked for us!  Thanks Karen, this is one we'll do again!"
55729,28648,2005-07-10,4,"I made a last-minute decision to make this this morning. As a result, I had to use bacon bits and (not enough) sliced cheese as filling. Although this worked out ok, I look forward to using better meat and cheese next time. I highly recommend sifting the flour in slowly. I had a hard time getting the mixture smooth - as a result I am sure I overmixed, leaving the egg a bit doughy and tough. I also highly recommend generously buttering the pan. Even with a heavy dose of cooking spray, mine stuck making it hard to roll."
126440,28648,2005-01-17,5,"I halved the recipe and cooked it for 8 min. added ham and cheese,cooked for 5 min.  then rolled it.  Awesome!!! I love it and have made it about 6 times and shared with my team at school.  You must try this easy and great tasting recipe."
103876,28648,2005-02-06,5,"I have been wanting to make this for a while and this morning was the perfect opportunity.  It was very easy to put together and the results was very tasty.  I especially liked the egg part, which turned out light, yet firm from the added milk and the flour.  This was an interesting new breakfast menu item and would be perfect for company.  I also posted a picture."
173314,28648,2005-02-09,5,awesome.  I did watch them and only needed 8-9 minutes cook time and then about 2 minutes more for the cheese  using a 9 X 13 glass pan. Sooo flavorful and quick.
176615,28648,2005-03-01,5,"So easy and very yummy! For a half recipe, a 9 inch square glass baking dish worked nicely. Dish must be well greased or it will stick. A great idea, this is an attractive way to serve eggs. Thanks, Karen!"
119466,28648,2005-03-15,5,"An easy, but very attractive breakfast! I didn't have any problem rolling the omelet---I used 2 spatulas & once I got it started, I was able to just roll it right up.Around my house, this serves 3:), & although I could make 3 omelets quicker, it is not nearly as relaxing as doing it this way. Perfect for a lazy Sunday morning. Thanks Karen! "
142367,28648,2005-04-12,5,Thank you for the wonderful recipe!  It will go into my favorites' file.  Warning:  this is very filling--I doubled the recipe and it was way too much for my two always hungry teenagers and bottomless husband.
18391,28648,2005-06-21,5,"Excellent, easy, and quick! Thanks"
124190,28648,2005-09-27,5,"This was very good. I had some trouble rolling it, but I think that was because I tried to do it in the pan. It did take me a little longer to get my eggs done. We really enjoyed this, and will make it again! Thanks!"
124249,28648,2005-12-10,5,"My husband really liked this. He used the leftovers to make himself a egg sandwich.
The egg part reminded us of a puffy German pancake.

Thanks Karen=^..^=

Bullwinkle."
59780,28648,2005-12-14,5,I made this for my annual Christmas Brunch Party and it was perfect. It made and elegant presentation and tasted great. Some of my guests asked for the recipe and that means a real winner.
125640,28648,2006-01-20,5,"This was the first recipe I tried when I discovered this website 2 years ago. Apparently I gave it 5 stars and meant to make it again, but promptly forgot about it because there were so many delicious looking things to try here. I had forgotten how fast this cooked the first time I made it (because it was the first thing I baked after we moved to Europe, I probably checked it every 3-5 minutes). I checked it at 7 minutes this time and the eggs were already set. I have tried it now both with the chopped ham and the sliced ham and found that it tastes the same, but chopped was easier to eat. I used sliced mozarella this time and that was delicious. And I subbed in wheat flour for half of the all-purpose this time (for health reasons I'm not supposed to eat a lot of refined flour) and I thought it made the meal a little heavier (more filling), but didn't think it effected the taste much. DH thought it made more of a difference. Got a little confused because I had said I was making him a baked omelet and he thought the egg part looked and tasted more like some kind of bread, but he said he loved the wheat flour and described the whole thing as nummy and used the word excellent several times between mouthfuls."
91392,28648,2006-11-05,5,"Another 5 stars!  Very quick, easy, tasty and looks great!  I stuffed it with different things--sauteed hot peppers, finely diced, bacon pieces, fresh tomatoes, diced, green onions, diced, and used Swiss cheese.  I would say, serves 4 with a salad or something on the side.  Grease the pan well, mine stuck in one spot, but I still got it out looking great. A real keeper!"
377581,28648,2006-11-29,5,"YUMMM! Excellent quick, easy, and very tasty breakfast. Next time I will add a little more cheese, but otherwise it's great just like it is. But I can see tons of flavor possibilities too. We'll do this one again for sure. Thanks so much for sharing it!"
182624,28648,2006-12-18,4,I can't believe I never rated this recipe!  I made this forever ago and loved it.  It just looks so pretty and different from the usual boring eggs but is even easier to make.  Be careful not to use too much filling or it will overflow when you roll it.
140132,28648,2007-01-30,4,I made this for Sundays brunch...we liked it very much.  But then you can't go wrong with ham and cheese....lol.   I was a little nervous about rolling it up but it rolled very easy.  I used diced ham as that is what i had in my freezer.  There was none leftover and enjoyed by all.  Thank you for a delightful way to spruce up the common omelet.....Stephanie
121185,28648,2007-09-22,4,"This was great and super easy.  My only problem is that I think there should be a general time given, say 12-15 minutes to bake.  I checked mine at 13 and it was done and browning.  Everything still came out ok - but I did have a bit of a problem with it baking onto the bottom of the dish.  Otherwise - GREAT!"
369715,28648,2007-11-10,5,We loved this. It was quick and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written. The kids loved that is was rolled up :) Will make again.
4470,28648,2008-05-25,5,"Very tasty.  I used Black Forest ham, cut the recipe back to 2 eggs and cooked it stovetop.  Lovely presentation  Thanks Karen for a keeper"
218535,28648,2008-05-27,5,This is a lot easier than regular omelets. Definitely a keeper.
64203,28648,2008-06-30,5,This recipe is genius!! I can't believe how easy this was to make. I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. I can't wait to try it again with different fillings!
178742,28648,2008-09-21,5,"We liked this alot! It was really easy and tasted good! I Used deli turkey, bacon, and shredded sharp cheese. Besides changing the meat, I followed the directions to the tee.. I found it hard to roll the omlet with it being so hot. So what I did is my spatula right under it as I rolled.. So when I had to stop due to my fingers burning, the spatula (back side facing up) stopped the omlet from unrolling. Worked out really good and we got to eat it piping hot. I served with my omlet shredded hashbrowns, and grits.
Thank you for sharing!!"
359220,28648,2008-10-15,5,"So cool!  I can actually make an omelet now that looks like an omelet!  15 minutes was way too long for my oven, but that's not necessarily the fault of the recipe, probably my oven.  Layered with ham and TONS of cheese, then rolled up (was a bit hard, had to use two spatulas and it still cracked a bit).  I topped mine with ketchup (yum) and noshed.  This is REALLY filling, so don't take too much!  Thanks Karen!"
173579,28648,2009-12-26,5,Great tasting omelet roll.  So simple to make.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
280166,28648,2009-12-28,4,I would have rated this a 3 -  I thought the flour made it have a a weird texture BUT my husband loved it so we split the difference!  Next time I would reduce the flour by half.  I also added sauteed peppers and onions to the ham layer.  This was a quick and easy meal for our lazy Sunday evening meal.  Thanks for posting!
1122161,28648,2010-09-23,5,"This turned out really good and fluffy! I'm not sure that I'll be baking this again, I will probally just use this recipe for a skillet omelet with a lid, that just seems so much easier for me. We really liked the flavor and texture! Thanks for posting!"
32058,28648,2011-09-03,4,"I  cook this @ 350 instead of 450.  Could be my oven, but I prefer it not to be crispy.  Otherwise great dish, use with ham or bacon."
1179225,28648,2012-11-19,5,"Perfect! This omelet  came out so fluffy and light. I halved the recipe, using a 9x9 metal pan lined with parchment paper coated lightly in oil. I used diced ham, cheddar and mozzarella. I'm thinking I'll leave out the pepper next time, just didn't like the way it looked. I'm looking forward to making this again experimenting with different add-ins. Thanks so much for this great recipe!"
1365025,28648,2012-12-29,3,It stuck to the pan but once I got it released it rolled real good. I did not care for the texture and if I would decide to make this again I would not use the flour.
400708,28648,2013-01-25,5,"I had so much fun with this recipe and made it more for the technique than the recipe.  I've never been able to make a pretty rolled omelet, they always fall apart on me and doing this it came out ""perfect"" I did cut it in half for the 2 of us and used eggbeaters with only one real egg, then added sauteed onions, peppers and tomatoes to it when adding the cheese and ham.  Used an Italian Blend of cheeses as that's what I had on hand.  Served with a slice of homemade bread, and fried potatoes and hot coffee - a great, filling breakfast.  This is one I can't wait to share with my DGS's who enjoy making breakfast.  It would be a wonderful way to make breakfast for a crowd."
198154,28648,2013-06-28,3,"I made this for dinner tonight.  It was fairly simple to make.  It didn&#039;t want to stay rolled up so I would probably just fold it next time.  DD didn&#039;t like it at all. I ate the small slice on my plate but I really felt that the flower taste was just too strong. DH, however, thought that it was just right. I great basic recipe that I will adjust  more to our tastes if I make it again.  Served with Timberlodge&#039;s Lumberjack Hash Browns."
768828,28648,2013-08-21,5,"This was very good and so easy.  I sprayed pan and lined with parchment paper, also sprayed with Pam and used the paper to roll up the omelet.  I sauted ham, onions and red pepper and added with the cheese the last 5 minutes.  This is a keeper - so easy to use whatever meat and veggies you have on hand.  Thanks for sharing.  Update - didn&#039;t have parchment paper so used waxed paper - big mistake - it really stuck.  Next time I will either use parchment paper or just put it in the pan with Pam and butter.  DD was here and she loved it too.  Can&#039;t believe I&#039;ve gone so long without making it again."
135887,28648,2013-11-28,3,"I have made something similar to this in the past but misplaced the recipe.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and combined the milk and flour before adding to the eggs to avoid lumps.  While we enjoyed this, we found the texture to be &quot;off&quot; and somewhat rubbery.  I hope to find my old recipe because the texture of that one was fine."
29782,95086,2005-02-07,5,"I just took this out of the oven  and WOW! This loaf may not last the night.  LOL   Its sooo Goooood!!!!
I fellowed step by step by this recipe and my bread machine and it turned out wonderful.  THank you so much for posting this recipe.  I wish  rating was more than 5 cause this would differently be higher in my view.  AWESOME! :)"
53932,95086,2006-01-29,5,"Great bread.  Nice and crusty outside, soft inside.  Perfect for dipping in olive oil and herbs.  I'm sure I will be making this recipe again and again."
137911,95086,2006-03-28,5,"Really flavorful and super easy to make using the bread machine for the dough. To make my long loaf, I flattened the dough gently into a long rectangle shape and then rolled it up long-ways into a long loaf shape.  Thanks for posting!  "
124249,95086,2006-05-27,5,"This bread couldn't have been easier to prepare. We really liked the taste and texture of the bread. It was a nice addition to our Italian meal.

Thanks andypandy.

64203,95086,2007-01-29,5,"Andypandy -
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Our Kroger grocery store has an Italian loaf that I LOVE. It's the kind of loaf that I can bring home and have to hide so that I don't eat the whole thing in one day. Well, I've attempted to duplicate their loaf for years to no avail.
Your recipe did it! This is it.... even better. I'm so thrilled to be able to make this soft and crusty on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside Italian bread at home. Thank you so much!!"
177933,95086,2007-02-17,5,Wonderful bread! I adapted for my kitchenaid mixer. Like someone else I rolled it out and then rolled it up and baked it seam side down. Made a nice long perfect loaf...like the yummy ones you get in the grocery store. A definate keeper! ***Updating this to note that I added a whole bulb of chopped roasted garlic to the dough and used roasted garlic olive oil...so wonderful!****
160974,95086,2007-06-15,5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent, and when I consider that I was short on the yeast and it still rose, downright amazing! I used bread flour and didn't make any changes.Will definitely make again!

update: I've made this many times and it never fails to please!

Roxygirl in Colo."
40961,95086,2007-06-20,5,"The best part about this bread is the taste of course but a close second is the fact that if you are afraid of bread making this will cure you. It comes out looking exactly like the photo. The directions are easy to follow and I am amazed at the end result. I used the bread machine to make the dough, it doubled it's size in 25 minutes and baked for 25 minutes. I just tasted it with 55309, a delicious recipe for Italian marinated tomotoes. A great combination. I'm sure this will be gone by the end of the day but it was so easy to make that I know I will be making it again tomorrow. thanks for sharing:)"
329638,95086,2007-07-20,5,"This turned out just beautifully for me.  The texture was perfect- smooth and soft with a firm crust and lovely golden color.  I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer to mix and knead, then let rise for 90 minutes and followed the rest of the directions.  I naturally had to sample a slice to be able to write a review, and I can hardly wait for dinner tonight so we can eat the rest!  Thanks for posting!"
394077,95086,2007-07-23,3,My texture came out densed but the crust is crispy and chewy.  I think the dough was a bit dry thus the problem.  I will reduce the flour or add extra water the next time.
383346,95086,2007-09-09,5,I took a slice 15 minutes after taking it out of the oven.  It was delicious with homemade garlic butter.  I didn't take a photo cause I was not satisfied with the way my bread was.  I should have let it rise in the oven like I'm used too.  But I'll try it again often.  Thanks Andypandy :)
8629,95086,2007-11-11,5,Terrific bread.  I sprinkled sesame seeds on the loaf after brushing it with the egg white.
50969,95086,2008-04-17,5,"I made this on 4/15/08 for the ""Flour Power Photo Challenge"", and also as part of mine and SO's dinner. I've always used store bought italian bread,but after making this recipe never again.Since there was only two of us,the recipe was cut in half.And if anyone else decides to do that you'll be sorry,because you'll want the whole loaf. I took the dough and made two mini loaves, and let it rise in a slightly warmed oven for about 30 minutes.Then I baked it for about 25 minutes. The smell as it was baking was just so wonderful.Then after it cooled a bit I split it in half lenghtwise buttered each cut side and sprinkled a little bit of garlic powder on each piece, and popped it under the broiler for about 5 minutes.The taste of fresh made bread was just wonderful. This will be made again. Thank you for posting and ""Keep Smiling :)"""
222433,95086,2009-01-11,4,Your recipe made me look like an expert bread maker! Tasted really good with a big bowl of soup. Will make again!
59163,95086,2009-09-07,5,"I've been making this for a couple of years now and just realized that I never reviewed it.  Super easy to make, mins. to throw into bread machine and very easy to form into the loaf.  I do put the egg wash on it and slit the top with scissors.  This also freezes very well."
46660,95086,2009-10-22,5,"Fabulous bread! I basted it with the egg whites twice during baking, and also spritzed some water into the oven a few times. It made a gorgeously browned loaf that was delicious! I did have to add water to the dough while it was mixing in the bread machine...a couple tablespoons. I also took another reviewer's advice and rolled it into a log before the second rise."
461834,95086,2010-02-10,5,"Wonderful Italian Bread!!!  I made this exactly as written, except I made it into two smaller loafs and froze one loaf, after the 1st rise, and baked the other for dinner.  I served this with Recipe #222310 and green beans for a fabulous meal!!  17 yo DS ate 1/2 of loaf himself!!  I will definitely make this again.  Made for I Recommend Tag Game."
353131,95086,2010-02-25,4,Dh had gotten italian bread from store that was SO Good! I knew I could make some every bit as good but kids were sceptical. When the loaf was baking ds was impressed. When we cut into it they were ALL impressed!!! This is so good and so easy!!!!!!
808027,95086,2010-04-18,5,"Perfect!  We loved this bread and it made a beautiful loaf.  Very easy to do in the bread machine, then allowing for the additional rising and baking time.  I scored the top of the loaf in an ""X"" pattern down the entire length of the loaf before applying the egg white and it baked up so beautifully.  The four of us  demolished the entire loaf in one sitting, except for one piece the dog stole."
136997,95086,2010-04-19,4,"I used my Kitchenaid for this recipe. I had to add a little more water, as the dough seemed a bit to dry and my machine wasn't working as it normally would when I make yeast breads. I used the final product with this recipe Recipe #382698 and it was delicious. :)"
1506604,95086,2010-06-23,5,Good bread. My bread came out a little dense but I think it's because I did it by hand instead of in the bread machine. Really nice and easy to make. Rises really high in the oven so you might want to move the top rack up a bit.
126440,95086,2011-06-23,5,"Wow! Great Italian bread.  Made to serve with an Italian meal.  Will use this one all the time, it is the best one I've found."
400708,95086,2011-09-18,5,"While looking for recipes to try out my new bread maker found this one and tried it for dinner last night.  Followed the directions to the letter and when putting in the oven sprayed with water for steam at 5 minutes and 10 and it was wonderful.  Nice crunchy crust with a soft, light center and a wonderful taste of fresh bread.  Between DH and me we ate almost half the loaf before the day was over.  It makes a nice big loaf and I'm wondering how it would do to cut the dough in half and freeze half for another day - might just give that a try next time."
470351,95086,2012-11-05,5,"Absolutely perfect recipe!!  I opted for the stand mixer method of preparing and mixed the yeast, sugar and warm water in the mixer bowl and allowed to froth for 10 minutes.  I then added in the EVOO and flour directly to the yeast mixture.  I added some salt, pepper and garlic powder to this as well and then let it beat with the dough hook for about 3-4 minutes.  I rolled it in a bowl that'd I'd rubbed down with EVOO to cover the outside of all the dough with a light layer of the oil and then covered it to rise for about 30 minutes.  I punched it down and shaped it into a loaf and covered it to rise once again for 30 more minutes.  I did the egg white wash and baked for about 25 minutes.  Absolutely unbelievable.  Probably my new favorite bread recipe.  Kids and adults devoured this!"
140132,95086,2013-07-09,4,This bakes up really beautiful.  We loved it.  I like the fact the the bread machine does most of the work.  Thank you for sharing with us.
489552,95086,2014-01-22,5,An other great bread recipe.  I love baking bread there is just nothing like it.  This was amazing!  Thank you for the recipe.  Will make it again for sure.
1072593,95086,2015-03-06,5,"152 reviews!  Well, looks like every review that I couldn&#039;t think up has been taken.  Great bread."
101034,34499,2003-12-03,5,"This is by far the best pork dinner I've ever had. It was just TOO GOOD. I used 3 thick pork cutlets instead of the chops and they came out so melt in your mouth tender and delicious. This is definitely going to become a regular member  of the family!!! Anyone who likes pork, should really try this recipe....you won't be sorry."
47907,34499,2004-12-14,5,I am not a fan of pork chops but DH is so I decided to give this recipe a try.  It was excellent!  I actually ate a whole pork chop ~ which is unheard of.  I made the recipe as posted except I used only 3 large pork chops but the same amount of sauce.  The sauce is wonderful over rice.  Thank you for posting this keeper recipe!
173314,34499,2005-01-25,5,This is about the only recipe I use now for baked pork chops.I use chicken broth in place of wine.  Soooo easy...sooooooo good!
178742,34499,2005-04-13,5,"This is one of my all time favorite recipes! The first time we had it we were totally blown away.. They were sooooo moist, and the sauce was wonderful. This is restaurant quality. The 3rd time I made it, I did not use wine, and it still turned out wonderful... Thanks for sharing!"
207176,34499,2005-07-27,5,"Very good!  I used cream of mushroom soup with garlic and I added the 2 tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce also.  It was a crowd pleaser, adults and children alike.  I served it with plain pasta.  Thanks Yooper!"
173579,34499,2005-12-19,4,We really enjoyed this dish.  It was so moist and tender.  I did not cook this as long as was stated.  Will be making this many more times.  Thanks for posting.
52543,34499,2007-04-20,5,"Aside from scaling down to 3 servings, I followed the recipe quite closely - the pork was moist & tender, the sauce was delicious! I trimmed the fat from some boneless chops and added Italian Seasoning (recipe 38293) to homemade multigrain bread crumbs. I also mixed the garlic powder & Mrs. Dash Original Seasoning Blend in with the bread crumbs. I also added some cooked sliced mushrooms into the sauce mixture. Thanx Yooper!"
50969,34499,2007-04-23,5,"First of all,let me say I wish that I could give this more than 5 *'s.Instead of using regular cream of mushroom,I used a golden mushroom(just my own personal choice).Instead of using white wine I used the same amount of chicken broth.Since another poster stated that she found them dry for the full length of the baking time, I cut mine back about 15 minutes and it worked perfectly.I served them with mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes.All together it made a perfect comfort meal.This will be made again,Thanks for posting.""Keep Smiling :)"""
222564,34499,2010-11-29,4,Very flavorful chops baked in mushroom soup based sauce.
312577,34499,2007-08-20,5,"These were REALLY GOOD.  I received great reviews.  These were the first pork chops I have ever made and they turned out beautifully.  I added the onion soup mix and think it was a great addition to this recipe.  Yooper, thank you!!"
316717,34499,2007-10-08,5,this was a hit w/ my family. i too added about a tbsp of worcestershire sauce and sub. chicken broth for wine. had 6 thin bone in pork chops and it came out super tender and delicious. brother came over for dinner and thought it was a little lacking in 'salt' but everyone else didn't think so. picky husband loved it so that's a huge A+! thank you for sharing!
371738,34499,2007-10-14,5,"I had to use condensed golden cream of mushroom soup, as that is all I had on hand. Worked out great. So tender and tasty. Thanks for sharing."
177933,34499,2007-11-16,5,"These were just wonderful...the best pork chops ever!  I did change it up a bit, but the idea is simimar I think.  Instead of using garlic powder and seasoning salt I used mccormicks steak seasoning and added it to the flour.  I used garlic and herb bread crumbs because it was what I had.  I also used cream of chicken because it is what I had.  I added a can of drained mushrooms.  Instead od white wine I used beef consume.  I followed your directions for frying the pork chops then I covered and baked for about 20 minutes and then added the sauce, covered and baked for about 30 minutes.  Delish!"
203325,34499,2007-12-02,3,My pork chops turned out a little dry and the taste was a little bland.
486718,34499,2007-12-03,5,My family loved this and they are not big on pork chops (I am!). This is really easy but so big on taste.  The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of the white wine as I didn't have any on hand.  Thanks!
140132,34499,2008-01-07,5,This was great.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  I love chops made this way.  I served with white rice and a vegetable.  I really like the breaded chop with the sauce.....thank you.....Stephanie
250031,34499,2008-03-03,4,"Delicious. The whole family liked them and they were very tender. I baked them for 1.5 hours also; that was sufficient. I might double the sauce next time, though."
324621,34499,2008-03-24,3,"This looked delicious and I couldn't wait to try it. It was a bit time consuming to put together and bake and in the end the results were not worth the effort. I thought they were okay, but no one else in my family cared for them. So the search continues for a great pork chop recipe...."
199792,34499,2008-04-13,5,"This pork loving gal gives this dish an A+! My husband and I thought they were indeed, awesome and can't think of anything I would change. I did cut the cooking time by about 15 minutes but only because I started late and we were getting hungry. They were thick chops and after an hour and 15 minutes they were tender and juicy with a lovely gravy. Thanks for sharing your excellent recipe."
8688,34499,2008-04-16,4,"The sauce for this recipe is delicious!  I used 4 1 inch beautiful boneless pork loin chops and substituted water for the wine. Unfortunately, my chops turned out dry. The cooking time at the top of your recipe said 2 hours, but in the recipe itself the cooking time stated 1 1/2 hours, which for pork chops I still felt may have been a bit long.  I used the 1 1/2 hour time however, next time I try these I may reduce the cooking time.  Delicious recipe, yooper. Thanks for posting!"
158086,34499,2008-07-09,5,"I loved this recipe....will have to make this for a family sunday dinner this winter...though I did change the baking time...1/2 hour without sauce then another half hour with sauce one,, 1 1/2 seemed way too long and mine turned out perfect cooking just one hour...."
485151,34499,2008-09-08,5,"The whole family loved this! It was really good- definitely a keeper recipe and one that we will make regularly.

I didn't bother to rinse the pork chops & dry them. I simply took them out of the pkg & followed the directions. I put the chops in the oven w/o foil for 35-40 minutes. Then I doubled the soup part & used 1 c. of milk & no wine (didn't have any) and  cooked the soup mixture in a saucepan. Then I poured the mixture on the pork chops and put it back in the oven for about 10 minutes."
229850,34499,2008-09-25,5,"This was a fantastic dish !! I shy away form pork chops in a casserole type dish as my family usually doesn't like it. But this was the bomb !! I used one cream of mushroom soup and one golden mushroom soup as I didn't have 2 of either. After reading some reviews I wanted to double the sauce. I didn't have the white wine on hand so I did sub chicken broth for that. Also I was out of milk, so I used half and half. How creamy was this sauce, wow !
Also I only had plain bread crumbs so I used Aroostook Italian bread crumb recipe#54348 and it work very well. I also cheated a bit and used a skillet with bacon grease that I had made bacon in. That part I was just lazy, but it tasted great !!"
369715,34499,2008-11-21,4,These were good and easy to make but we thought they could have used more seasoning. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used 8 thin pork loin chops so I cut the cooking time down. Next time I would add some seasoning to the gravy and some pepper to the chops.
44383,34499,2009-01-03,1,Made this exactly as described but suspected the chops were going to be way overdone after baking for so long and they were.  The sauce was good but not enough to really use on the rice.  The chops tasted like cardboard and I threw the leftovers out.  Won't be repeating this one.
126440,34499,2009-03-26,5,Great pork chops.  I made half a recipe but all of the sauce.  Great with Recipe #133821.
355637,34499,2009-04-01,4,Tasty way to make pork chops.
226863,34499,2009-04-11,5,"This was great!  I am not normally a fan of pork chops, but this recipe was so tender and yummy, I'll have to make it again.  I made this for Chef Alphabet Soup Tag 2009!  I'll have to add this to my favorites for 2009.  Thanks for posting."
195589,34499,2009-05-14,5,"Very good, all loved them! Like others I added 2 tsps. of worcestershire. I only had 4 chops, but they were very thick, so extra sauce was just right. I also double-dipped the chops for a very nice crust. I cooked for 45 minutes, then the additional 30 with the gravy. Thanks so much for posting, yooper!"
189475,34499,2009-10-20,5,"This was delicious! I used 3 pork chops instead of 6, so I only needed 1 egg. I served it over angel hair pasta. If I were to make this with 6 pork chops I would double the sauce. There was enough sauce for 3 pork chops and pasta, but if I were serving 6 people I would need more sauce for the pasta. I will definitely make this again sometime. Although it takes awhile to cook, the prep time for me was only about 10-15 mins. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
305531,34499,2009-10-25,5,"Yum! I made this for one serving so had plenty of sauce for the chop and some mashed potatoes too. I used a Canadian seasoning that I received from my Canadian friend Nif. Really good stuff! Simple, quick, moist, and tasty. Thanks yooper for sharing. Made for Cookbook Tag."
937635,34499,2010-05-07,5,"These were great! I used 5 pork chops and 1 cup of bread crumbs which was plenty. I didn't have italian bread crumbs, so I used plain plus about 1 tbs of italian seasoning. I went waaaay overboard on the seasoning and it kind of overpowered things, so next time I'll cut back to 1 tsp or less. I like the sauce and think I might try adding sauteed onions and garlic to it next time because I love everything with that combo! After reading the reviews, I cooked the chops for 45 minutes and then added the sauce and cooked for another 20-22 and they were perfectly done. I made Recipe #24476 on the side and it was perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!"
138429,34499,2010-08-19,5,"Having some pork cutlets to use up ,I decided to use this recipe. I baked them for  half the time without the sauce and when adding the sauce I baked them for 30 minutes. I did add a bit of dill to the soup mixture. They were wonderful and a dish I will make again soon. I will use pork chops next time. Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
1133190,34499,2010-11-24,4,These were pretty good. My husband really liked them.  They were a bit time consuming to make.  If you like pork chops I'd say these would be worth a try!
54678,34499,2011-04-14,5,We all enjoyed our dinner last night. Had no wine so subbed apple juice. Served with couscous and garlic broccoli 132765
928301,34499,2011-06-24,5,"My husband said it was good, then told me because of this meal it seemed like I wanted something.  I guess that means it's really good.  I did what others said because I didn't feel like waiting.  With baking I gave 40 minutes then added the sauce then gave 20 more minutes.  I had pretty thick pork steaks and they were well baked so I don't think anyone has anything to fear about cutting 30 minutes from the wait time."
55578,34499,2011-10-30,5,"what a treat!  Very moist and tender, wonderful sauce!  I added the worchestershire sauce, double it and it was wonderful!"
176615,34499,2012-01-14,5,"Delicious! Was surprised how moist and tender the pork chops stayed. Took 4 more than one inch thick  pork chops and cut in half. There was plenty crumb mixture to coat my 8 chops generously; in fact, next time I'd reduce the crumb mixture by half. Used recipe #360192 with minced sautéed mushrooms rather than canned soup. Also, I cooked 40 before the sauce and 20 minutes after. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
185446,34499,2012-08-26,4,"I'm not a fan of creamed soup recipes, but since it was posted by yooper, who has many  other delicious recipes, I thought I'd give this a whirl.  Easy, tasty and a change of pace from ordinary pork chops.  I had very thick chops, so timing worked out well, although I turned the oven temp down to 325.  Thanks, yooper, for yet another good recipe."
2549237,34499,2013-01-24,4,"These were really good.  We made these exactly as directed.  I pared this with scalloped potatoes, Pan Roasted Broccoli and Frizzled Cabbage.  This was a delicious, wholesome meal."
191533,34499,2013-04-10,5,"Best pork chops recipe so far! Great flavor! Frying time is much less than 5min per side; 3 minutes and they were too black for me. Also, I baked them less than the allotted time and still felt the pork was a little tough; not sure if it needed to be cooked longer or shorter..."
632249,34499,2014-04-15,3,"We thought the recipe was good but there were a few problems.  The chops turned out dry and the gravy was really thin so I thickened that up with a slurry of cornstarch. The total cook time listed is way off.  If you cook for the full time listed in the recipe, it should be closer to one hour 30 minutes (add another 10 minutes for prep) so I don&#039;t know where the 2 1/2 hrs comes from which is listed at the top of the recipe. All in all though, the flavour is good so by reducing the cooking time and thickening the gravy, I would probably try this again. Thank you for posting!"
37779,34499,2014-08-28,5,"This recipe reminds me of my grandmother&#039;s fried pork chops w/ gravy. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was outstanding. Moist tender chops with scrumptious gravy. Some effort is involved, but it is so worth it. Definitely will add this to my top-fav comfort foods list. Thanks for posting this one."
176615,269331,2010-12-04,5,Very good on a Greek salad or just about any combination of greens and veggies. Simple to mix with pantry ingredients. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
133174,175824,2006-07-10,5,The crust for this was Basic Pizza Dough recipe #151791 by mama's kitchen. I used the full 3/4 cup baby portabello mushrooms and grated mozzarella. The red pepper was roasted and was quite large which meant I used only 1. I topped it off with freshly grated parmesan. DH and I both enjoyed it
169969,175824,2006-07-24,5,Great combination of flavors! The pesto was perfect with the veggies! I chose the fresh red pepper route and placed them as rings around the pizza. I loved the provolone cheese!  Diva-licious is right!
37449,175824,2006-08-14,5,"I made this for lunch today and so glad I did! I used homemade pesto. While I was gone my DH and his friend ate the rest of the pizza. They loved it! Thanks Divas, you did a great job! Diva-ine!"
222970,175824,2006-08-17,5,"Superb pizza. We used prepared pesto, mozzerella cheese, sauteed red peppers, and forgot to buy the mushrooms! Very good. The kids had me make half without artichokes, but boy they missed a real winner."
126440,175824,2010-06-09,5,We especially loved the pesto on the Great pizza.  We did it on the KJ and turned out so tasty.
226863,175824,2011-04-28,5,"Yummy, yummy!  I broke my diet for this one, and it was well worth it!  Thanks for sharing!"
222564,175824,2012-10-13,5,"Pesto and antipasto on pizza, ooh and aah!"
101823,16884,2004-08-08,5,"I love BLTs and thought that this recipe was great.  I omitted the green pepper and used the shredded lettuce very sparingly as a garnish in the center of the dip.  Served with the larger Wheat Thins, this was a very yummy dip.  I am sure that it will be a repeat recipe for me."
22015,16884,2002-11-29,5,"
Awesome is the right word for this dip.  It was sooo good.  Everyone loved it and I didn't even have any green peppers to put in it.  We ate it on crackers and on tortilla chips.  I thought that is was best on the chips.  Since it wasn't all eaten the first day, I heated it the second day so that the cheese would melt.  That was really good too.  Made this for Thanksgiving and not only got requests for the recipe, but have been asked to make it for the family Christmas too.  Thanks sooo much for posting!"
32772,16884,2003-01-02,5,I made this for our New Year's Day celebration and there was none left. Served it with three types of crackers from Hickory Farm and when they were gone people were putting this dip on nachos. LOL. Makes enough for a large group. I made it the night before so flavors could mix and did't use the lettuce at all. Placed it in hollowed out peppers.  Thanks for a quick recipe with a lot of flavor.
52543,16884,2003-08-18,5,"The taste is awesome & I will definitely make it again. However, I found the mixture so thick that the crackers/scoops kept breaking - next time, I'll double the sour cream. Thanx Manda!! "
35526,16884,2003-08-31,5,"I made this dip as my ""treat"" after dieting for several days.  I only can 1/2 cup of it and was soooo wanting more.  I mixed the 1/2 cup dip with 1/2 cup lettuce to make it go further, lol.  Good dip.  I hadit with fat reduced Ritz.  I will be making it for parties."
76951,16884,2004-02-28,5,I made for a carry-in at work.  I sampled it at home the night before and was impressed but overnight the flavors blend and it was fantastic the next day!  I served with rye cocktail bread and firm water crackers.  Ritz style was too buttery for this dip.  I will definately make this again!
55729,16884,2004-04-09,5,"Had to add my five stars - loved it. This dip is quite ""sturdy,"" so next time I'l buy the Wheat Thins instead of the store brand - they are crisper (and the wheat flavor complimented the dip well)."
26512,16884,2004-05-29,5,"Awesome is an appropriate description! I made this pretty much by ""feel""...I didn't measure anything, but I have a pretty good eye, so it was probably close! I did use chopped green onion and although I was tempted to use fresh garlic, I used the powder.I used 2 small tomatoes and I actually forgot to put the lettuce on top. That's okay, DH took one bite and said ""MMMMM"". Okay, he's not crazy about dips, so this is a big compliment. He actually said ""This stuff rocks, make sure to rate it a 5!"" And I agree! This was easy, has a great flavor combination and can apparently do a disappearing act! Thanks for sharing, will definitely make this again!"
175824,16884,2005-12-10,5,"This was outstanding. I took this to work and all rated it 10 stars. I don't know if I can say this but one of my co-workers said ""m-m--m--m this is a food orgasims""
Thank you so much for sharing such a yummy recipe. I will be making this again and agian."
142559,16884,2006-02-05,5,"OUTSTANDING!!! I served this at our Super Bowl party this year and it was a HUGE hit!!!  Very tasty dip! I did omit the green peppers and lettuce and just served it in a bowl. It was gone in a flash! Thanks so much, this is a KEEPER!!!! A+++++++++++"
329638,16884,2006-08-28,5,"I made this for a birthday party two days ag.  So delicious, was great with crakers, bread, pretzels, a few people even put it on a bagel and ate it as a sandwich.  Yum!"
182624,16884,2006-10-18,4,"We loved this!  We skipped the lettuce, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  "
230557,16884,2006-12-22,5,This is such a refreshing dip!  Better tasting than a BLT and I love that it's mostly sour cream based vs mayo.  Next time I will add more tomato as that was my favorite taste.  Thanks very much!
58836,16884,2007-01-11,4,Given all the excellent ratings I thought I'd make this for a church function.  It went together really quick and tasted good right then.  Later (a few hours) I didn't think it was as good.  Must be my taste buds.  I may make again but may add less garlic powder.  Not sure what I think it's missing.  Thanks!
158086,16884,2007-01-16,5,I made this to take to our euchre club this month...it was a big hit...I served it with toasted bauqette bread....
38643,16884,2007-02-05,5,I made this for a Superbowl Party and it was a big hit.  I think next time I will take my husband's suggestion and try adding some green onion.
315055,16884,2007-02-20,3,"I omitted the tomatoes and made a week in advance and froze, then added tomatoes the day of.  It didn't get soggy and tasted pretty good.  The dip was pretty dense, though."
140132,16884,2008-01-28,5,Delicious.  This is so good. Thank youfor posting....Stephanie
46660,16884,2008-02-05,5,"FANTASTIC! I made this for a Superbowl party. I doubled the sour cream and added an extra tomato since a lot of reviews said this was so thick. I omitted the green pepper, and instead I added 2 diced avocadoes. I used ""light"" everything; sour cream, mayo, cream cheese, cheddar, and even the bacon. I also added some black pepper and hot sauce. I did not use lettuce. I served it with the big Wheat Thins. This made a HUGE amount of dip, and it was demolished completely! Everyone loved this, and I am expected to make it again next year. There were even people making sandwiches with it! The only thing I might change next time is to only add 1 avocado...I think I went a little overboard there. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!"
8688,16884,2008-03-02,5,"My guests enjoyed this so much it was gone in no time at all! I made as directed, using green onions.  Thanks for this wonderful dip recipe, Manda!"
447123,16884,2008-10-24,5,WOW!! this was amazing. REally I am almost with out words. I am almost finished making it (almost done with the bacon) and so far it is outstanding. I will really impress our friends tonight!!!
632249,16884,2008-12-23,4,"I thought this dip was okay but maybe I was expecting it to be over the top because of all the reviews.  I took it to a party and brought back about half of it so would not say it went over that well.  Thx anyways, it is always nice to try something different."
359220,16884,2009-05-16,5,"5 STARS!  I was asked the bring a veggie tray to a graduation party and was determined to bring something other than the pre-made dips.  I think I completely negated the nutritional value of the veggies with the pound of bacon, cheddar and creamy components, but it was well worth it!  I can completely understand eating this with just a spoon!  So tasty and I look forward to serving more often and trying it with some corn chips too!"
252816,16884,2009-08-15,0,"I made this dip for a homebrew beer tasting party I had..Everyone loved this,very habit forming.There was 7 people and the dip was totally gone in no time....I left out the lettuce as we had it outside and it was very warm out...Served with mulitgrain club crackers..Also used cherry tomatoes,I think I cut up about 8  tomatoes,nice tomato flavor..This dip is a real winner, Highly recommend this recipe..Thank U..."
1179225,16884,2009-08-23,5,"I served this today for a get together on our boat. I set this on the table, turned around to do something else and when I turned back around the bowl was surrounded. There were no words, just mmmm...mmm! And then it was gone. I think that says it all. Thank you for posting your recipe."
400708,16884,2009-10-25,5,"DH and I were invited over to a neighbors last night and I needed something quick, easy and yummy to take with me.  I'd been saving this one for some time and decided this was the perfect oppurtunity.  Was it good, I followed the recipe except for one minor change, added a half of chopped and seeded jalapeno to give it a little more kick and did not use the lettuce (didn't have any) and everyone loved it.  An unusual dip that had lots of pretty color and a differant taste of most of your cream cheese dips.  We'll be using this one a lot.  Served with crackers and a bottle of wine - PERFECT!"
231054,16884,2009-12-10,5,"Very tasty dip.  I originally made it to use as a veggie dip -- but I didn't care of it that way, so bought some RyeKrisp crackers and it was wonderful!!!  I didn't use the entire pound of bacon and my dip was still loaded with it.  Very unusual recipe -- but very, very enjoyable.  Thanks for sharing it."
29782,16884,2010-07-18,5,This was a HUGE hit at the lake this weekend!  I did add some chopped up salami and alittle dill relish.  The longer it chilled the better flavor it got.  I liked how easy it was to make too.  This will go into my favorites for future times.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
126440,16884,2014-06-16,5,I only made 1 c. of this dip but loved it.  Great with Flipsides.  Still have leftovers after using it as an appetizer.
198154,16884,2016-09-02,4,"Football, wings and bacon dip! I served this with wheat thins and tortilla chips. My family seemed to like it better with the tortilla chips."
8688,29679,2002-06-10,5,"There is no way this recipe could rate less than 5 stars!  Greyghost is right!  These DO taste exactly like Reeses!  These were so incredibly easy to do.  I made almost the entire recipe in my food processor and there was no mess!  These are fantastic and will undoubtedly be made again and again and again........Thanks for an excellent recipe, Karen!"
37305,29679,2002-06-17,0,"I should mention...if you start cutting them immediately upon removing them from refrigeration, sometimes the chocolate cracks a bit, or is hard to cut through.  After sitting out of the refrigerator for about 10 minutes, the chocolate is much easier to cut through and less likely to crack.  I just made them again today and nobody wanted to wait, so we ended up with some cracked chocolate :)"
22015,29679,2002-06-20,4,"The goal here is to duplicate the taste of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and this recipe did just that according to my family (I can't eat the sugar). For my other peanut butter cup recipe you end up making balls of peanut butter dipped in chocolate. They taste great, but this is so much easier and still has that same taste to it. I will be making these from now on.  UPDATE: Let me start off with, this review is based upon my experience making them and the experience of others eating them.  (I can't eat sugar).  That said, they were easy to make - much better than the recipes were you make them into balls.  As for taste, I was told that it needed more chocolate, so next time I will make them in a larger pan and double the millk chocolate chips, however despite that everyone agrees they taste great."
33159,29679,2002-06-23,5,"I'm not totally convinced these taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  Nonetheless, they were DELICIOUS!!  (I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate because that is what I always have on hand.)"
13796,29679,2002-07-07,5,"Yep.. Ditto.. very good recipe. I had trouble with the chocolate cracking too.. so next time I'll try leaving them on the counter after taking them out of the fridge before I cut them. I used semi-sweet chips, too as that was all I had in the freezer."
28649,29679,2002-09-04,5,WOW!!!!  These are rich but oh so good.  I made them to pack in the kids lunches as dessert but I see that they are almost gone already.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips because thats what I had on hand.  These are a winner.  Thanks Karen!!
49304,29679,2002-12-03,5,"Delicious, Yummy,MMMMMmmmmmm. made these yesterday, a big hit you need 10 stars for sure. My DH and the little 89 year old Lady that I take care Of really love Sweets. I am passing a long your recipe to others that love REESE'S candy."
37449,29679,2003-01-07,5,"My husband and daughter were asking me for some Reese's peanut butter cups but I had run out! Soooo, looked on here and made these and they were more than satisfied! To make 1 1/2 cups grahm cracker crumbs, I used  12 grahm crackers, and ground them in the blender. Oh, I used cinnamon grahm crackers. Delicious!"
81611,29679,2004-02-06,4,"Should have cut them even smaller. They are just yummy sugar bombs. Too tempting for me, but I enjoyed giving them to my friends' kids (and NOT my own little ones, who make me sorry when I give them any chocolate). I used natural PB to ease up on the unhealthiness, but they were still quite sweet. Good, when you want a VERY rich goodie."
13483,29679,2004-05-20,5,Can't add anything else but say  Wow. . . sinfully rich but damn good!!
42720,29679,2004-09-25,5,"I have been making this recipe for a long time and we all love it!  I always make these at Christmas time.  If you really want to get ""fancy"" with them, the Wilton's Company (cake decorating & candymaking supplies) make a candy mold that looks exactly like a Reeces Peanut Butter Cup.  A little more work but they look very nice on holiday trays.  "
38643,29679,2004-10-09,5,"What else can I add to all of the reviews this recipe has received other than it's excellent, easy to make and a must try! "
104295,29679,2004-10-14,5,"These taste like the ""Buckeye"" candies I used to make.  Very easy too, especially if you usually have graham cracker crumbs around.  (I buy them on sale at the off-price store.)  I made them for the youth director at my church, a young college guy who likes to take baked goods back to the dorm to share.  Thanks for such an easy tasty recipe!"
189616,29679,2005-03-25,5,"Great recipe Karen!
Did exactly as you posted with no problems, took it out of fridge after set-cut it in squares and put it back in the fridge with non of the problems that others mentioned"
176615,29679,2005-04-11,5,"Really easy treat that everyone loves! This would be a great yet easy dish to bring to a pot luck or other function. I used a glass 13 x 9 dish, chilled well and didn't have any trouble getting them out. Thanks, Karen!"
29782,29679,2005-04-15,5,"What can I say? This recipe is a MUST now in the house. Absolutely awesome! I fellowed the recipe as given and my results was great. I let it set up about 45minutes after I put in ref. to chill and went to take it out and cut into squares, I had no problems what so ever, they came out perfect. I agree that this recipe should rate higher than a 5 star!Its heavenly!
 I'm looking forward in sharing this with my friends. Thanks for sharing a awesome sweet heavely recipe!!!
 "
147109,29679,2005-04-15,5,"Wow, this is such a tasty treat.  It was a bit too sweet for me, but I brought it to a morale boost potluck at work and it did the job to boost morale, so it deserves five stars just for that!  Everybody was asking for the recipe!  Thanks so much!"
101823,29679,2006-05-30,4,"Very much like a Reese's peanut butter cup.  I didn't have milk chocolate chips on hand and instead subbed semi-sweet.  That is excellent for the dark chocolate lover.  These were a bit crumbly and not quite the replicate of an elementary school lunch recipe that I have been craving.  I will continue my search for the perfect peanut butter bar.  Thanks for posting, though."
110078,29679,2005-05-05,5,Tastes just like the real thing.  Totally awesome treat.  Definitely follow the instructions and don't chill too long before cutting.  It is a total pain to cut if you do:)
173579,29679,2005-06-16,5,This recipe is just wonderful.  Taste just like Reeses Cups.  I had my son over for dinner and served these for the sweet.  He thought they were the absolute best.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
232480,29679,2005-07-31,5,"Made these this afternoon - they are so quick and easy and so very, very yummy!  These are definitely a keeper and won't last long, I'm sure!  Thank you for the recipe!"
93006,29679,2005-08-01,5,"What a find this recipe is!  Super easy, and how could anyone not love these?  Instructions were perfect, as I think these would indeed be very hard to cut if allowed to get to hard in the fridge.  Definite keeper!"
40961,29679,2005-08-16,5,"Excellent recipe, easy to make, ingredients usually in the house and delicous. I would give it 10 stars if I could, thanks for posting:)"
185285,29679,2005-08-27,5,Like this needs another review!  I made thcker bars by scaling the recipe to 2/3's and using an 8x8 pan.
222564,29679,2005-09-13,5,Yummmmm! No need to say more.
222433,29679,2005-12-16,5,Super! I used semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate because the store was out of them. I also lined the pan with plastic wrap so I could lift it out easily. Made for easy cutting and clean up! My family loved them! Thanks Karen!
125640,29679,2006-06-12,5,"I was afraid that these would be too sweet for me, so I scaled everything except for the chocolate and sugar to the 16 oz jar of peanut butter I had and used bittersweet chocolate and natural peanut butter. We thought they turned out great, kind of like a cross between Reeses and a rich peanut butter fudge. I cut the pan into 32 pieces and can only eat a half a piece at a time, but that couple of bites is just delicious. Very quick & easy too."
146047,29679,2006-08-07,5,"I'm hardly blazing a trail here with 223 ratings submitted before this one.  Still!  These suckers are excellent, and I don't care who knows it.  I used about 150 g of graham crackers (1 package of 10 sheets of crackers), and that was perfect.  I also went with 360 g of confectioners' sugar, which should be about 3 c according to the package. Perfect replica of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. My 9-year-old says they're like the mini ones as opposed to the bigger ones.  *shrug*  I found that a 10""x15"" pan was perfect, and no need for extra chocolate (although I'm sure that wouldn't hurt!).  48 bars are what I got.  Thanks so much for posting these.  I'll be sharing this recipe far and wide."
369715,29679,2007-08-28,5,My 8 year old and I made these for dessert tonight. The family loved them. Will make again.
146486,29679,2007-03-20,5,How have I not rated these yet???  I have made these soooo many times for various gatherings and sometimes just to have at home.  I can't believe I haven't reviewed these delicious little treats.  Everyone should try these as you will quickly see what all the fuss is about and be addicted like the rest of us!!  Thank you for such an incredible recipe!!
173314,29679,2007-04-01,5,EVERYONE loved these!  So easy to make and will be a regular for my kids...so easy to make too...will make sure to keep ingredients on hand.  thanks
329638,29679,2007-04-18,5,"Holy cow, these are so darn good!
I made them for Easter (I was in charge of the desserts this year)
These were gone in almost no time, so I ended up making another batch that same day.I didn't bother chilling them, just waited until the chocolate chips hardened again at room temperature.
So yummy- our new addiction!
Thanks!"
74281,29679,2007-04-23,5,"I made these to take to my DD's BF's house to meet his parents for the first time, and what a hit they were! I followed Rainberry Blue's advice and lined the pan with waxed paper so they were really easy to get out of the pan. These bars will be on my list of items to make for parties and potlucks on a regular basis!"
402559,29679,2007-05-15,5,Used reduced fat peanut butter and butter and it still came out soooooo good. Thanks!
377581,29679,2007-05-22,5,Very very good! These are definitely one of my favorites. Easy recipe and a real treat...for all ages. Thank you so much for this.
140806,29679,2007-07-08,5,"Yum. These take no time at all and the outcome is to die for. My peanut butter mixture might have been better if I let it chill  before adding the chocolate, but I could hardly wait to try one of these. I let everything set, cut into squares, and then removed from the pan. They are extremely rich and I could only eat one, but I will be eating more!"
407007,29679,2007-11-27,5,"delicious! tasted just like a reese's, except VERY VERY VERY rich. my hubby who could eat probably four reese's in one sitting only ate half of one of these and said ""it's delicious, but rich."" :) they would be great to make for company so we don't have the pan sitting around tempting us all day. very easy recipe! it's a keeper!!!"
80998,29679,2007-12-21,5,"I know this does not need another review, but hey!  These are super easy and very good.  Be careful to read the directions well.  I didn't.  I used 16 ounces of conf. sugar which is 2 cups.  Fortunatly I realized the consitancey couldn't be right and re looked at the directions to add the last cup.  Turned out well.  I used parchmant paper as suggested by others.  I also cut before completly hard, however, if you wait to long and it is hard, simply boil a cup of water and warm your knife before cutting."
218535,29679,2007-12-27,5,Easy to make and delicious. A keeper.
140132,29679,2008-01-23,4,"Very good. Very rich but sooooo yummy.  I like the fact that they are so easy to make.  DH couldn't quit eating them and he doesn't have a sweet tooth, so that is one of the biggest compliments....thanks for posting....STephanie"
242484,29679,2008-03-31,5,My 11 yr. old son says he would give this recipe 8 stars if he could!  These were great!  Will make over & over!
131021,29679,2008-06-14,5,I couldn't believe that i had not rated these yet. They were so good and everybody in the family loved them. MMMMM
52262,29679,2008-08-04,5,Delicious!  I loved this dessert!  Very easy and fast to make.  I used 2 bags of chocolate chip: 1 milk chocolate and 1 semi-sweet.  I like more chocolate with my peanut butter. YUM!
92886,29679,2008-08-22,5,"I too made these for a co-worker's birthday.  They were mightily enjoyed by all.  I also doubled the chocolate chips as many others have done.  I added a little salt to the bottom mixture.  I lined the pan with parchment, once they hardened up I lifted the whole thing out of the pan and used a mezzaluna (half moon shaped blade) to cut them and that did a great job."
489552,29679,2008-09-18,5,"I made these for my daughter's baby shower, all my guests loved them.  My daughter's finally day of work (going on maturnity leave) is next week, and she asked me to make them again so she could treat the office gang to something.  So thank you very much for a delicious & easy treat!"
189475,29679,2009-02-03,5,"I have made this several times and just forgot to review it before. This is a great recipe. Very easy to make, and it tastes great too. I brought it in to work a few times before, and the whole thing would be gone within 5 minutes. Next time I make them it will be even easier, because last time I was at the grocery store I noticed that they sell 'graham cracker crumbs' in the baking section so it's not necessary to buy a box of graham crackers and crush them all."
315055,29679,2009-03-18,3,"A little too rich for my tastes, and I didn't like what the graham cracker did to the flavor.  Thanks for posting, though"
177933,29679,2009-07-29,5,Couldn't have been easier... now to stay out of them!!
298447,29679,2010-07-02,5,"Delicious, indeed!  (After hundreds of glowing reviews I hardly think there is anything I can add that hasn't already been said.)  We used low fat graham crackers and Skippy peanut butter.  Also, we lined the pan with wax paper (as suggested) for easy prep n' press & cleanup.  These really do taste similar to Reese's...can't wait to make them again!"
250031,29679,2010-07-05,5,Easy and ooooh so decadent. I lined the pan with wax paper too. Took them to a Fourth of July celebration and it was so hot today that I had to keep moving in and out of the refrigerator. But they were a big hit.
264017,29679,2010-11-01,5,"Definitely easy to make, delicious to eat and RICH. We loved every bite!"
305531,29679,2011-05-15,5,Yum! I made 1/2 batch but should have made a full batch because my grandson and his friend finished these off in nothing flat. I added a little bit of cream to the chocolate and they turned out well. Thanks Karen for sharing this simple and great recipe. Made for I Recommend Tag.
98919,29679,2012-02-22,5,Very rich and very delicious!!
400708,29679,2012-06-17,5,"So easy to put together with things I always have in my pantry.  And the taste; yum!!  Chocolate and PB, couldn't ask for any better.  Cut these small cause they are rich, but they won't last long, at least not in my house.  A perfect after dinner desert to serve with coffee or milk.  All the kids in my family voted them 2 thumbs up."
39301,29679,2012-12-16,5,Adding my voice to the masses here to say how much we LOVE these little squares!  Thanks so much for posting.  I'll be making them often.
178742,29679,2015-01-15,5,I guess I forgot to rate these when I made them way back when! They were DELISH!!
1581225,29679,2016-11-26,5,"These were amazing! So, so tasty. Definitely for the peanut butter lover. We don't have graham crackers here so I used McVite's Digestive cookies which according to google is an acceptable substitute. I was eating the mixture while making them. I used baking paper for ease of removal and cutting, but they will definitely cut cleaner if they are chilled enough so both the peanut mixture and chocolate are solid, but without the chocolate being too hard. Keeping this recipe for sure!"
27643,13285,2002-05-13,5,"Oh, these are so good! I used the basil, because we love it, and served these on toasted onion rolls. They are full of flavor, very delicious! Thanks for a great recipe, najwa!!"
37779,13285,2002-09-27,5,A wonderful burger najwa!! My husband and I loved the combination of herbs and spices. We love olives  and feta cheese too so this was perfect for us. I served on  grilled onion rolls. Thanks for this one.
91392,13285,2004-03-27,5,"This really is excellent.  Made it exactly as written, served on two halves of a pita spread with hummus.  Super good, will do again and again!  Husband LOVED them!  Would be nice very small as an appetizer dipped in hummous too."
146047,13285,2005-04-23,5,"najwa, these are excellent turkey burgers. Yum! With the exception of the oregano, I used all fresh rather than dried ingredients. Very tasty off the grill, and perfect on DotM's Bread Maker Hamburger Buns (#89932). These would also make great meatballs. Thanks for posting this delicious dish."
180090,13285,2005-04-24,5,"Very flavorful and juicy! I didn't put in the olives and didn't grill them, but cooked them on the stove and they still came out wonderful. Served them on toasted onion buns with mayo and lettuce. Will make again, many times! Thanks :)"
103876,13285,2005-06-08,5,These turned out great!  I used all white turkey meat and omitted the olives.  I cooked them on my George Foreman grill.  The seasonings are very nice.
53932,13285,2005-08-05,5,Let me add my five stars.  These were really good.  I also used chopped onion and minced parsley.  Grilled them on my George Foreman and they turned out so much better than I expected.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
160974,13285,2005-12-15,5,"These were sensational tasting. The whole family enjoyed. Served on buns, with green salad and Tater Tots on the side. I pan fried these in a little olive oil and it formed a nice exterior crust. The way the feta gets creamy is  the best!

Roxygirl"
188119,13285,2006-03-15,5,"These were pretty good.  I extended it to 6 servings by adding some oats although next time I do that I should also add more spices and cheese to balance it out.  Very nice recipe.  If I get a meat grinder (although I've wanted one for a while), I'll be trying this a lot with ground chicken (or turkey around november).  Thanks!"
55578,13285,2006-08-16,5,This IS probably the best turkey burger ever!!! Def make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.
140132,13285,2007-01-30,5,"We loved this burger.  I have never made anything ""greek"" before so I wasn't sure how my family would react to this combo of flavors and ingredients, but they loved it!  I made Frank Butchers Tahini #3722 to go with it and they were fantastic....thank you for a new taste, wonderful recipe....Stephanie"
359220,13285,2007-02-26,5,"Yum, Yum, Yum.  My DH is very into turkey burgers, so I'm trying to find variations to make a normally bland choice of ground meat stand out.  I used 3oz pre-crumbled feta and about 1/4 cup chopped kalamata olives and next time I might add more of the olives.  I used the Pasta Sprinkle herb mix from Penzeys instead of parsley and basil and subbed in garlic salt for the onion, garlic and pepper.  Yum, Yum!  Served on toasted wheat buns with broccoli salad on the side...Will definitely use again!"
125640,13285,2007-05-19,4,"Easy and very good. I used garlic feta and black olives and did opt to use the basil. I grilled them on my George Foreman grill (2 at a time for 5 minutes, but I think it should be for slightly less time next time); served them on whole wheat buns with lettuce and dijon mustard. I will be making these again. Thanks for sharing."
43083,13285,2007-12-12,4,I have had this in my cookbook for a LONG time and finally had a chance to make them tonight. I added some greek seasoning and thats the only change. Outstanding recipe and so quick to throw together. I didnt find the feta or olives overpowering at all. Thanks for a great recipe!
497077,13285,2007-12-26,5,"These are GREAT! I use a bit less feta, omit the olives, and use fresh grated onion instead of the onion powder. I have served them as you would a regular burger and also in pitas w/ tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, and onions. This has become my favorite recipe anytime we grill burgers!!!"
394077,13285,2008-04-08,5,Wow. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is absolutely delicious. A definite keeper in my permanent collection.  It is so good that my family ate two burgers each.  Me too. :)  I didn't have the olives but it didn't matter.
368078,13285,2008-06-16,5,"mmmm, delicious.  We made just as directed, except we halved the recipe to make 2 burgers.  Will make again often!"
226863,13285,2009-01-27,5,"Oh Wow! I made this exactly as posted, and it was fabulous.  I ate this on Arnold Select Sandwich Thins, something new I found at the grocery store.  I can't stand the pita bread at the grocery store, and didn't have time to run to the greek market for fresh!  These sandwich thins were a cross between a pita and a hamburger bun, perfect for this burger!  Next time I'll throw some cucumbers and sliced onions on the bun with the burger.  And mix up some tzatziki sauce to use instead of the mayo.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  I loved it!  I made this for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Tag!"
142335,13285,2009-01-28,5,"Wow! This was so awesome! I wasn't expecting this to taste as wonderful as it did. I'd give it more than 5 stars. I didn't even use the full cup of Feta. I bought the smaller one at the store by mistake. I can only imagine it with more!!! I made my patties four hours before cooking so the flavors would meld a bit. I served them on pita, with lettuce, tomato and topped them with Egyptian Garlic Yogurt Cucumber Salad Recipe #200504 . I even love this without sauce. I made two with black olives for me and two without. The burgers without olives were still great but think the black olives gave it extra great flavor. I'm thrilled, what a great way to make ground turkey taste good. I'll be making this very often. THANK YOU!"
358796,13285,2009-03-28,5,"Was afraid that they would be overly seasoned, but they were terrific! A tad salty from the olives, but overall great with a little low-fat mayo, crisp romaine on a grilled whole wheat bun."
126440,13285,2009-07-06,5,"Great burgers.  I did use chicken that I ground myself and served with Recipe #93401, Recipe #66596 and for dessert, Recipe #326367.  Great Greek meal."
937635,13285,2009-07-27,5,"Wonderful! I used mozzarella instead of feta because I don't like feta (I'm a weakling) and nixed the olives bc SO doesn't like them. These were sooooo good!!! Thanks, Najwa!"
312577,13285,2010-02-11,5,"I have been planning on making these burgers after I got some lean turkey on sale.  I followed the recipe except I omitted the olives.  I was worried that my BF who is not a huge olive fan would not like them.  I served these on the 40 minute buns (Recipe #183081) and Tzatziki (Recipe #287845).  This recipe deserves the fantastic reviews and I encourage others to make these burgers.  I did cook them in an electric skillet as my grill seems to always break my burgers apart.
Thank you for posting."
198154,13285,2010-03-14,4,DH didn't sound too thrilled when he asked what was for lunch and I told him greek turkey burgers. I had made greek burgers using a different zaar recipe.  He said they were ok but probably don't make them again.  He isn't a big fan of ground turkey but he was surprised by these. I used a combo of green and black olives.  He said they were so much better than the ones he had before.  I made a greek pasta salad to go with it. A great summer meal!  Thanks so much!
1122161,13285,2010-07-25,5,"This was an outstanding recipe! I never tried a turkey burger, and I wasen't expecting it to be that great...but this was delicious! We will be making these often! Thanks for posting!"
1269015,13285,2010-08-01,4,"I subbed the turkey with chickpeas for a veggie burger. They didn't stick together at all, making for a sloppy meal, but were pretty good -- a very unique veggie burger. I look forward to trying this in a veggie pita wrap, too."
176615,13285,2010-10-02,5,Yum! These were awesome burgers! Used kalamata olives and 2 t chopped fresh garlic. Feta adds so much flavor and helps keep the burgers from drying out. Leftovers were just as good. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
1179225,13285,2011-07-28,5,"Amazing burgers!  I agree with others that these would make grat meatballs. They were so easy to put together. I used mostly fresh herbs, but did add dried Pasta Sprinkle from Penzeys rather than Italian seasoning. I made the burgers in to sliders and froze the extra patties raw and look forward to grilling them soon. Thanks for this great recipe. I wouldn't change a thing."
173579,13285,2011-08-18,5,These are absolutely wonderful.  We loved the combination of flavors.  We will make these over and over again.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
35526,49387,2004-04-18,5,"This is by far the best eggplant recipe I have ever tried.  It came out of the oven crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.  I peeled my eggplant, personal preference.  Loved that it was not oily or soggy.  YUM, try this one kids!"
37449,49387,2004-04-30,5,"I picked this for the chef of the day game. Lovely flavor, easy to make. Thanks so much!"
22015,49387,2004-07-06,5,My husband & I adore eggplant but need to watch fat intake.  I decided to try this after a reccomendation by a couple of other reviewers.  To my surprise my dh & I weren't the only ones who enjoyed this.  I think that his dd - who has a list a mile long of things she doesn't like - ate more of this than we did.  Any time I get that kind of reaction from my picky eater it has got to be 5 stars!  So thank you for the recipe.  Not only will I be making this again but DSD said that she wanted a copy to put in her cookbook that we're making for her.  Thanks!
101034,49387,2004-08-18,5,"This was great!! I couldn't believe how nice and crispy the eggplant turned out. The taste was so good, just perfectly cooked, not the least bit mushy. I loved the prep and clean-up too.....very, very little. Thanks for posting."
95743,49387,2005-01-22,5,"Outstanding!  This is just terrific and is now my favorite way to eat eggplant.  Crispy, cheesey outside, creamy, onion-flavored inside.  Not in a million years would I guess how healthy this is.  Wow."
49304,49387,2005-04-17,5,"Delicious,We love fried eggplant, this is so much better and better for you.I used Italian style bread crumbs and still added the Italian seasoning, also used an Italian eggplant as that is what I had on hand. Thank you James for posting this GREAT recipe, I will be making this often."
185285,49387,2005-10-12,4,Great served with Marinara sauce!
278113,49387,2006-09-07,5,"Fabulous!!! I used this as a base for my eggplant parmesan. But, luckily we had some extra, and snacked on that while we waited for the parm to bake. Both were just fantatic, and I know we will use this recipe over and over in my home..thanks for sharing!!"
347822,49387,2007-03-01,4,"Loved the textures, tender inside and crunchy on the outside. The only drawback was the acidic after taste.  I soaked the eggplant slices in salt and water but it did not work.  Any other suggestions on how to remove the taste?"
37779,49387,2007-03-29,5,"This is a super great way to cook eggplant. I peeled the eggplant because the skin has a bitter after taste that my kids do not like. Turned out golden and crusty on the outside and very tender on the inside with no messy grease. My kids liked these dipped in marinara. Thanks for a wonderful, healthy eggplant recipe."
229524,49387,2007-07-09,5,"Great recipe, loved that it was so easy.  Used regular mayo and served with Marinara Sauce (58246)and Green Beans (162873).  Made for a wonderful dinner. Thanks James Craig for sharing such a terrific recipe.  We will be making this often :)"
97579,49387,2007-07-26,5,"I loved that this recipe would fit perfect with us since we are following weight watchers.  This was so easy to do!  I left out onions because of my picky kids.  We made eggplant parmesan, so when it was just about done, I added mozzarella on the top, melted it and then broiled for a few seconds to brown it up.  I served with pasta & spaghetti sauce and everyone gobbled it up!  The only change I would do is peel it.  All the kids and myself didn't particulary care for the skin since it didn't cut easily.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
138429,49387,2007-10-16,5,I have to admit it was the first time I have prepared Eggplant and this recipe was an excellent choice. We loved it and will be eating it often since we are trying to get more vegetables into our diet. Great recipe and thanks for sharing.
187281,49387,2008-01-11,5,Great dish... had alot of flavor and is the lightest version of fried eggplant I've found.
407007,49387,2008-01-17,5,"wow! this is really good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I was out of paramasan so I skipped that but melted some mozzerella on top during the last 3 minutes of cook time and served it over noodles with about a tbsp of spaghetti sauce. it's a keeper! looking forward to taking the leftovers to work tomorrow for lunch! :)"
499050,49387,2008-02-19,4,Very Good!
140132,49387,2008-02-20,5,"OMG....this is awesome.  I like eggplant but my kids didn't.  However when they tasted this they ALL ate it, and liked it.  When they asked what it was they were a little stunned....lol.  I will definately be making this next summer when my garden is in full bloom....yummmmm i can't wait.   I really liked the mayo on these, it adds a different flavor and also the fact that they are baked instead of fried.  Thank you for posting this great recipe....Stephanie"
470351,49387,2008-03-02,5,This was really excellent.  I've made this 2 times now and would have to say that I like the eggplant sliced 1/4 inch thick vs 1/2 thick and my husband agrees.  Seems to be more like true fried eggplant when done thinly.  I added extra onions to the mayo mix.  i also added crushed red peppers and parmesan to the bread crumb mix.  Really great recipe!
286851,49387,2008-04-25,5,"I made this last night, and we loved it! I loved that it tastes so good, but is so much better for you than frying. I served it with angel hair pasta and marinara sauce, topped with a little extra parmesan cheese. So good, can't wait to make it again. Was quick and easy too--followed the directions to a tee. Thank you for sharing!"
377039,49387,2008-05-15,4,"This was quite good; my husband and I don't really care for eggplant but are trying to expand our variety, and this is a way we will have it again.  I made some adaptations and some mistakes with the recipe. First off I did peel it, because the skin is way too tough and bitter for us. Next, my husband hates onion so I subbed a hefty dash of garlic powder.  I forgot to mix parmesan into the bread crumbs. The crumbs were Italian style so I didn't add more italian seasoning, but I didn't have enough of them so I added some flour, a bit of salt, and other seasonings into it.

The cook time was spot-on, but I did have to broil a little bit to get them to brown on top. I served with a bit of spaghetti sauce for dipping.

Despite my unintentional butchering of the recipe, this was pretty good.  We'll have it again."
64583,49387,2008-05-21,5,"This is my first time having fried eggplant and it definitely won't be my last.  It was so delicious, although I did find that I don't care for the peel.   Such easy preparation and wonderful taste.  I used a baby eggplant and ate the whole thing myself.  The slices browned up beautifully also.  Next time I will be sure to have some marinara for dipping."
174991,49387,2008-05-21,5,"Great recipe.   I peeled the eggplant and followed the directions.  Crispy outside and cooked, but not mushy in the inside.  This will be a great treat for the summer."
125640,49387,2008-07-20,3,I served this topped with marinara. Pretty good and fairly easy. Thanks for sharing.
140806,49387,2009-01-11,5,I feel like I am tasting eggplant for the first time! This recipe was so crisp and light. I peeled my eggplant out of a personal preference and used sourdough breadcrumbs. Topped with mozzarella and broiled for an additional two minutes. Served with homemade marinara. Just delicious!
126440,49387,2009-03-10,4,Served with Recipe #19135 for a great meal.  Very easy vegetable to fix and you can be cooking something on the stovetop and not worry about it.
185926,49387,2009-03-25,5,"I LOVE it! I do not have mayonnaise in the house, so I used fat free plain yogurt. It tasted fantastic. We ate everything. I used Reynold's Release foil so I did not spray the bottom of the pans, I just sprayed some on top of the eggplants. Otherwise, I followed the reciped exactly. I would definitely use this recipe again. THANK YOU JAMES CRAIG.  March 09, we still love this recipe.  It's our favorite way to eat eggplant.  I still use non-fat yogurt instead of mayo.  Now I serve it with red spaghetti sauce for a dip.  Still love it."
226863,49387,2009-05-20,5,"Very good! I used fresh eggplant picked fresh from my garden this morning.  I did salt my eggplant and let it sweat beforehand.  These are very easy to make and very tastey....they are like potato chips. Once you eat one, you have to eat another!  Thanks for posting!"
489552,49387,2009-07-13,5,"This was good.  However....I don't think I am a fan of eggplant.  Yes, this was my first time making eggplant, as I am always looking to fit veggies into our meals.  I did like the cheese, I'm a big cheese fan :D"
91392,49387,2009-10-04,5,"Super good, a real surprise.  Next time I will make zucchini as well, I think it would work just as well.  Good one!"
318235,49387,2009-10-05,4,"Nice way to prepare eggplant. It didn't have a lot of flavor pop so it couldn't be served as a stand alone dish, but I served with pasta and it tasted amazing with a little bit of the marinara. Thank you."
189475,49387,2010-04-12,5,"This was delicious and so easy to make. I wanted to add extra flavor to the mayonnaise mix so I used onion, shallots, chopped fresh basil and fresh garlic. The mayonnaise mix was so good that I dipped some potato chips into the leftovers! I know, totally unhealthy, but it was so good that I didn't want to waste it. I added an Italian blend cheese to the top of the slices during the last 5 minutes of baking. I served this with my garlic, olive oil parmesan potatoes recipe (Recipe #414616 ) and my roommate and I both enjoyed the dinner even though it didn't have any meat in it and we usually like meat with dinner. I will definitely make this again soon! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
637486,49387,2011-08-28,5,These are amazing!  The only change I made was that I used panko bread crumbs as that was all I had.  They were so crunchy and had a delicious flavor.  I wished I had found this recipe earlier in the season so I could enjoy it more often!
2041603,49387,2011-10-27,3,"This wasn't bad but we didn't really enjoy it either. However, it was our first experience with eggplant. Might try again another day."
1179225,49387,2012-01-18,5,"We loved this recipe. I peeled the eggplant, used panko crumbs that I seasoned pretty heavy with fresh garlic, salt and pepper. I also  topped with mozzarella cheese and broiled the last couple minutes of baking. Served them on top of garlic spaghetti with a dollop of marinara sauce. So, so good! Thanks for posting this delicious and healthy recipe, can't wait to make it again."
298447,49387,2012-05-27,5,"LOVED this.  It was so easy to make (even despite my aversion to mayo)!  I used the olive oil mayo in this recipe and found it super easy to assemble and bake up.  I even enjoyed leftovers up to 2 days later crisped up in the toaster oven!  Thanks so much for an simple, tasty dish.  Would love to try this for eggplant parmesan dish."
2549237,49387,2013-01-18,3,"This was very simple, but I will definitely stick with the Traditional Eggplant Parmigiana that I normally make from now on.  The breadcrumbs tasted gritty and were unappealing."
68460,49387,2013-08-25,5,We loved this eggplant.
255338,108364,2006-07-20,5,"I was not sure if we were supposed to make them with skin on or not, so I made mine without. My kids raved about the coating. They did not miss the skin at all. I used the really hot Indonesian hot sauce, and diluted them with water to make 1 cup, and the spiciness was just perfect. Thank you for sharing a fantabulous recipe."
68960,108364,2007-02-03,4,"This is great. We did 2 batches, one with tabasco and the other without for my kids.  We all much prefered the batch without the tabasco as for our taste it came through a bit too strongly. I cut the chicken into strips and double dipped them. The Chicken was extremely juicy and tender. Definitely will be making again."
13796,108364,2007-07-03,4,I decided use wings for this recipe. I didn't think the hot sauce/egg mixture made the chicken spicy at all. I added 2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper to the dredging mixture and was very happy with the results. After draining the wings I tossed them in a bowl with my brother's home made wing sauce. Mmm.. very good with a side of celery and some homemade bleu cheese dressing.
37868,108364,2007-07-09,5,I made this for my brother for July 4th. I followed the recipe just as it. What a wonderful recipe and crispy chicken. I sure will be making this over and over. Thank You so very much. Hugs
58836,108364,2007-07-11,5,"Made tonight for supper.  Yummo!!  I only used 1/2 cup of hot sauce, was really good, not hot at all just very good and spicy.  Fried up chicken breasts and between myself and dh we almost ate them all.  Thanks."
240552,108364,2007-08-18,5,"Wow!  This was wonderful!  The whole family raved about it!  I'm going to try it with tenders next time, too. :)  I double dipped - first put seasoning on, dredged in flour, put in the sauce, then dredged again in flour.  The coating was super crispy and delish!  Thanks for posting!!"
140132,108364,2007-10-31,5,"MMMMMMMmmmmmm....you just cant beat southern fried chicken.  I don't fry my chicken very often but am glad I did this time.  I was worried the hot sauce would make it too hot for the kiddies, but they seemed to gobble up there pieces without noticing it.  Thank you for a truly great tasting chicken recipe.....

353131,108364,2008-01-24,5,"This is awesome chicken. DS wanted KFC last night and I told him that I could make something just as good!
He didn't believe me. When I was frying the chicken he came over and said, that looks good. When he tried the first bite he said, mom this really is better than KFC!!! DD's also thought it was really good. DH only ate one bite but he thought it was a keeper too! Very easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly except used hot sauce that had garlic already in it!!
Will make again!"
185285,108364,2008-04-28,5,"Oh my gosh... I CAN fry chicken! Thanks for a fool-proof recipe. I used peanut oil over med-high heat so that the strips could cook completely through without burning on the outside. DH had wanted to grab fried chicken (At KFC, no less) but said he was sooo glad he let me try out this recipe first! Thanks!  4/2008 Update: I have a gas stove, and for me, the Medium setting is the best way to get the oil around 350 to where the chicken cooks through without burning the crust. I also like to put the lid on while it's cooking in order to better circulate the heat."
132764,108364,2008-07-21,0,This is the one I'm going to use from now on. I love the coating. Substantial but not too thick. I marinated my chicken tenders for several hours but used buttermilk instead of water.
278113,108364,2008-09-08,0,"We really like this chicken, and it was not spicy at all for us."
37449,108364,2008-10-08,5,I used chciken legs and just a little hot sauce. My husband loved it! Thanks Sharlene!
46660,108364,2008-11-07,5,"Truly a five star recipe! I have never made fried chicken before, as I try to avoid fried foods. However, my son was begging me to make it. The skin was beautifully brown, crispy, and flavorful. I skimped a little on the hot sauce (I used Frank's Red Hot), but next time I will surely use the full amount. We all really loved this. Thanks!"
218535,108364,2009-01-02,5,Loved it.
227607,108364,2009-03-16,5,"OK....this is my new fried chicken recipe.  It is much messier to make than my normal but the crunch makes up for it without a doubt.  I can not wait to try it with chicken tenders for the kids.  I added a little extra seasoning(salt, pepper, and garlic) and it actually could have used a little more.  Hubby sprinkled more salt on it at the table."
126440,108364,2009-07-07,5,Great fried chicken.  I made half a recipe and used 2 chicken breasts cut into strips.  I only used 1/4 c. hot sauce as I didn't have any more.  Still had great flavor and easy to do.  Great served with Recipe #36501.
251626,108364,2009-08-26,5,Great. Could have used a little more spice in the dredging mixture. but it was really great.
185446,108364,2009-10-02,5,Here's one more five star review for an excellent fried chicken recipe.  A nice crispy coating over tender and slightly spicy chicken--will be making this one again!
315055,108364,2009-10-13,4,"The batter was really good, but I think next time I would forgo the hot sauce.  I don't really like my chicken spicy and it really changed the taste of the chicken having the sauce in it.  Thanks for posting, though, it did turn out to be some impressively beautiful fried chicken!"
969481,108364,2009-11-01,5,"Made this last night for Halloween dinner and it was fantastic. This was the first time I ever deep fried bone in chicken and it turned out fantastically crispy (not KFC, but close enough!) Both my spouse and my teenage daughter said it was the best fried chicken we have made and said they would definately make it again. Thanks for sharing!"
879716,108364,2009-11-29,5,"I found this recipe when I was in the midst of preparing my chicken for frying - because of that, I didn't follow all the seasoning directions of the recipe.  I just loved the tip of adding baking powder to the flour and adding hot sauce to the egg wash.  I also appreciate you telling me the frying temp and how long the different meats take to cook.  This was the first time I've been able to fry ANYTHING outside of my tiny deep fryer.  The chicken came out beautifully and I was so proud.. ha ha.  Since I was preparing this for a camping trip, I didn't tasted it while it was still hot but it was great cold.  Look forward to using all these tips again!  Thank you so much for posting and teaching me how to fry  :)"
1133190,108364,2010-05-30,4,"This was my first attempt at fried chicken.  It was pretty good but we thought it could have a little more flavor.  I also had a lot of the dredging mixture leftover, which seemed kind of a waste."
847160,108364,2010-08-22,5,really good
1122161,108364,2010-10-21,5,"This was the best fried chicken I have made so far! Don't be afraid of the hot sauce, it just adds seasoning and isn't really hot. I love that the directions were spot on with frying dark/light meats. Thanks for posting!"
1072593,108364,2011-03-06,0,"Brace yourself, maybe against a large piece of furniture.  My picture speaks for itself."
222564,108364,2011-04-14,5,Fantastic!
280271,108364,2011-05-12,5,DH loves fried chicken! I break down once a year and make it for him. This was the selected recipe for this year. He just raved about it. Very easy to prepare and it was tasty. Made as posted with the exception of cutting the recipe in half. And using shortening because I didn't have peanut oil. Cooked in my electric fry pan. Thanks for posting. :)
176615,108364,2011-07-10,5,"Wowza! This was the best fried chicken I've ever made or eaten. The family loved it. Not at all spicy, just perfectly seasoned. Just the right amount of ingredients for 8 thighs and 10 drumsticks. Used a deep fryer at 375 degrees, cooked drumsticks 13 minutes and thighs 18 minutes. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
110078,108364,2011-09-21,5,Yummy!
620763,108364,2012-02-29,5,Turned out really good! I marinated the chicken in the egg mixture for about one hour. Came out really tasty!
377039,108364,2012-10-25,3,"The chicken was juicy and crispy, but not flavorful. I will make it again, but I will thoroughly season the breading. With the right seasoning in the breading this may become a five-star recipe; as is, we found it to be perfectly cooked, perfectly crispy, but bland and boring."
456858,108364,2013-10-01,3,???  This was just OK 4 me.......would NOT make again.
195589,108364,2014-05-14,5,"This came out excellent!  I had never made fried chicken before, so was a bit worried. I put the seasonings in with the dredging flour and used Frank&#039;s hot sauce. Also, because I double-dipped my chicken, I had just the right amount of flour. Thanks for posting, Sharlene!"
64203,43509,2004-08-02,5,"I made these muffins today and they are so delicious! I'm trying to watch what I eat, but with these, my ""diet"" went out the window. My entire family gobbled them up :) Yummy!
Thanks for posting such a wonderful recipe!"
52543,43509,2004-08-09,5,A moist & tasty muffin with a topping that is absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe verbatim - including the walnuts. Thanx Kitten!
100526,64015,2003-10-29,4,"I found the powdered sugar needed much more liquid than in the recipe. I added a bit more corn syrup and more milk.

I did like how easy the icing was to spread and how it dried smooth and hard.

"
42720,64015,2004-12-21,5,"This is the best cookie icing I have ever used.  I did use an extra teaspoon of milk and an extra teaspoon of corn syrup to get the consistency I wanted for spreading but it dried beautifully and was shiny.  I made this recipe several times as I had 12 dozen sugar cookies to frost.  Thanks JuneBug!!
"
9869,64015,2005-05-12,5,"This was great, I made Canadian Maple Leafs recipe #64633 and used this icing to ice them. I needed to use 3 tsps of milk and as we cant buy corn syrup here I subbed golden syrup..which worked out great as it gave the icing a lovely amber colour.
Great recipe, thanks for sharing."
59780,64015,2005-07-05,5,"This recipe is amazing and I plan to use it many times in the future! I first used it to frost some star shaped cookies for my daughter's kindergarten farewell. After seeing how well the icing worked, I used this recipe two more times that same week for hamburger cookies recipe#89105  and hotdog cookies recipe#16121. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
37636,43509,2004-09-04,5,Very light and nicely moist! Has a great banana flavor with the perfect touch of caramel from the topping. Will be great for my breakfast! Thanks for posting.
124190,43509,2004-11-30,4,These were really good! I doubled the recipe; it doubles with no problems. My son loves them. Very easy and fast to make. Thank you!
160974,43509,2004-12-28,5,"This is my favorite banana muffin recipe. I love how high they rise. I add banana extract to the batter. Half the time, I don't even make the topping. They're that good!

Roxygirl in Colo."
64583,43509,2005-01-28,5,Delicious!  Great banana taste.
149363,43509,2005-03-17,5,"These muffins are just terrific!
Well written, easy to follow recipe makes these a snap to whip up and makes good use of ""older"" bananas.
I left the walnuts out as DH doesn't care for them, and the topping was still just delicious.These are a keeper!
Thanks for another AWESOME recipe Kitten!"
172369,43509,2005-03-29,5,"I crave these muffins daily...I just ate two of these delicios muffins, I made them with splenda and they were just as good as the original batch made with sugar. It really cuts down on the carbs. Thank you Kitten for a fantastic recipe."
168462,43509,2005-04-11,5,"My son who hates any type of fruit said these muffins were fabulous. My DH said these were the best muffins he has ever had, and could not stop eating them. Thank you so much for the recipe."
103876,43509,2005-04-24,5,"These are truly great muffins.  My mom made them for us last night and we were fighting over the last one this morning for breakfast.  I know this is probably against the rules, but we did substitute part applesauce and margarine for the butter and Splenda for 1/2 of the sugar to try to keep them a little healthier.  They still were fantastic.  I am planning to make another batch today.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
13796,43509,2005-05-01,5,After seeing all the reviews I just had to give them a try.. and YES.. they are wonderful! I used my 'muffin top' pan and it made eight huge muffin tops. Next time I'll make nine. I doubled the topping (adding a little cardamom as a personal preference) and there was plenty to liberally cover each muffin top. I baked them for 15 minutes and they are perfectly tender and delicious. A keeper for sure.
9869,43509,2005-05-03,5,"These are wonderful..cant think of anything else to add to all the reviews.
The only change I msde was to use pecans instead of walnuts.
Delicious muffins. Thanks for sharing."
36944,43509,2005-06-22,5,"This is a well written, easy to follow recipe that uses ingredients that I usually always have on hand.  (But I may have to wait a day or two for my bananas to get ripe emough!)  I only had two large ripe bananas so that's what I used.  I doubled the topping, but did not use any walnuts.    I sprinkled the tops with about half the topping then pushed it lightly down into the mix, then topped it off with the rest of the crumbs.  I didn't have any of the crumb mixture fall off of the muffins.  The result of this was 12 big, moist, delicious, crunchy topped muffins that were absolutely delicious!  These muffins are over the top!  Kittencal thank you so much for a recipe that was a family favorite from the first bite and will be made in my kitchen on a regular basis.  "
218535,43509,2005-07-09,5,moist and delicious. I love the topping. Definitely a keeper.
189616,43509,2006-01-04,5,"Excellant. Very moist
Thank You KITTENCAL!"
222433,43509,2006-02-11,5,"Loved these!! Very moist, tasted and smelled fantastic. Had them for breakfast with a smoothie. The kids loved them. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!"
51011,43509,2006-04-02,5,Wow! so easy and good!  No changes were necessary.  I think that next time I will try the batter as a bread.  Thanks for sharing!
33159,43509,2006-07-28,4,"These muffins were quite moist & tasty.  I used 1 cup of mashed banana & used pecans in the topping.  For some reason, most of the topping ended up melted all over my muffin tin instead of on the muffins."
180090,43509,2006-09-01,5,"These are awesome banana muffins! I think they taste best the 1st day. The topping makes them better than the average banana bread and I noticed that they are not as oily as some of the other banana breads I've made. I like how it uses 3 bananas, because we always have so many ripened bananas leftover! Thanks MizzNezz!"
222970,43509,2006-10-04,5,Five stars! My only complaint was that the recipe didn't make enough! Next time I'm doubling it!
173314,43509,2006-11-21,5,"delicious, easy and will be my only banana recipe now!"
185446,43509,2007-02-07,4,"Feel foolish being reviewer #114...but I can see why there are so many positive comments.  I made these in Texas muffin pans, so only got 7 muffins.  We especially liked the topping and banana bread consistency.  Thanks, MizzNezz!"
394077,43509,2007-02-12,5,Delicious.  Very easy and boy do they smell good while baking.  I used oil instead of butter and they still came out delish.
184723,43509,2007-03-19,5,"MizzNezz... these are seriously yummy!!!  My 8 yo and 10 mo old seriously couldn't get enough of them.  I used whole wheat flour and they were still light, fluffy and moist!  Thanks a lot for another great recipe! :)"
92816,43509,2007-03-24,5,With so many great reviews how can you go wrong?This is a very moist muffin.I am not a big fan of bananas but decided to try this anyway.I'm glad I did.It's alot like a banana bread but just in the shape of a muffin.I added toasted pecans to my batter and also a handful of chocolate chips.Very good recipe.
373817,43509,2007-04-18,5,I loved these! I made them today for my Japanese teacher's birthday and she also really liked them! I'll definitely make these again! Thanks!
294000,43509,2007-06-07,5,"Add another 5 stars to the list!  I've tried several banana bread recipes and, honestly, this looked like all the rest but it tastes better!  I skipped the nuts and used my mini-muffin pan.  They were done in about 10 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I've already hand-copied it into my ""Family Favorites"" cookbook."
229524,43509,2007-07-08,5,Love these!! Very moist and your right the topping is great.
251917,43509,2007-07-23,5,AWESOME - they are delicious and will be made again and again at our house!
389431,43509,2007-07-31,5,These are just too yummy!!  Mine didn't turn out too pretty because I used country crock instead of butter for the topping...  it all just kind of melted everywhere... but they are still wonderful!!  I have already had 2 and they were just popped out of the oven!!  Thanks so much for this keeper recipe!!
132383,43509,2007-08-14,5,"Basically, this is a WOW recipe. My nephew helped me make these while we were visiting...the dozen didn't last long.  Everyone was raving about these muffins!  Thanks so much for a excellent recipe."
329638,43509,2007-09-19,5,"These were very tasty- moist and light, even with the substitutions of white whole wheat flour and applesauce for the butter (except for in the crumb topping).  Delicious!  Thanks for posting!"
37305,43509,2007-10-02,5,"I made this into bread instead of muffins.  I doubled the recipe and then divided between three 8 x 4 loaf pans.  I baked for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees and they came out perfect.  My crumb topping didn't look like crumbs after baking...more like a coating, but I didn't use the nuts so that may be why.  The topping was slightly crisp and sweet and complemented the bread perfectly.  Thanks for posting!"
64642,43509,2007-11-19,4,"Lovely and moist, densely packed with banana flavor.  Perfect complement to my morning coffee."
40961,43509,2007-12-21,5,"I love these, I make them often and I always double the topping. Everyone enjoys them and the house smells great while they are baking. thanks!"
140132,43509,2008-01-21,5,Yum....what can I say.  Banana muffins are good standing alone but then add the topping and they are over the top...delicious.  Thank you for posting....STephanie
316717,43509,2008-01-30,5,"this was delicious. and best of all very easy to make. great recipe, thanks for sharing!"
242484,43509,2008-06-04,5,Absolutely wonderful muffins!
439797,43509,2008-08-06,5,YUMMY.  My boys love to have frozen muffins they can grab for breakfast and this recipe's a keeper.
485151,43509,2008-09-21,4,"These were great muffins- even without the topping. (It was late, I was tired & running out of time.) I followed the directions exactly and the turned out great. The kids loved them and so did I."
532289,43509,2008-10-19,5,"Yummy.  I put nuts on half the batch.  I baked them for 18 minutes and they were perfect.  I will make these again.  I didn't realize that muffin topping was so easy to make.  Also, this is the only muffin recipe I have ever made where the cupcake liner didn't stick to the muffin keeping half of it when it was peeled away."
80998,43509,2008-10-24,5,I used the topping for another banana bread recipe.  It turned out great.  THanks.
359220,43509,2008-10-31,4,"Doubled the recipe (had a lot of brown bananas to use up) and only got 21 muffins out of it by filling 3/4 full.  I too had the problem that the topping melted down and on the first batch, even started to burn until I covered them with some foil for the rest of the baking.  The topping formed more of a sweet crust rather than the crumbly type that I was looking for, so I'll need to play around with that, but otherwise, very easy and super moist.  Thanks for posting!"
402559,43509,2008-11-07,5,"These are very, very yummy. I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour and 4 bananas because I needed to get rid of them. Mine came out crackly topped too but they taste so great it doesn't matter how they look. Thanks for sharing I will be making these A LOT!"
8688,43509,2008-12-14,5,"Marvelous, Magnificent, Moist and Munchable Muffins!!  Tasty and moist, an unbeatable treat : ) Breakfast or snack, anytime at all! This simple recipe is sure to please the banana muffin lover in you ; )  Thanks for this super muffin recipe that will hold a special place in my cookbook, MizzNezzl!"
1072593,43509,2008-12-31,5,"This recipe is a ""best of the best"" in my book.  That equates to, ""I could literally live off these!""  My sweet tooth thanks you."
126440,43509,2009-01-08,5,Delicious!  I made these this morning and took some to school.  The comments were great.  I had one earlier and the flavor was very good.  The topping makes it.
60260,43509,2009-02-24,5,My family woke up to a wonderful aroma this morning.  Great recipe!  I love banana anything so I knew this would be a winner without even tasting but actually tasting was a treat.  I'm having hard time staying away from the leftovers.
280166,43509,2009-05-03,5,Yummy!  My son's new favorite muffin!  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for posting!
187373,43509,2009-07-04,5,"Delicious muffins! But be careful...I filled mine 3/4 full, but when I put the topping on, it overflowed in the oven and made a mess! Very pretty, rose nicely and taste great!  Only had 2 bananas and it was fine, plus added pecans to the muffins as well as the topping. Thanks for posting!"
59163,43509,2009-08-22,5,"I was surfing early Sat morning and stumbled on this recipe.  I had all the ingredients, so made a batch following the recipe to a t, which I always do the first time.  These were so quick and easy to ""throw,"" together with excellent results. Will be making these again and again."
810787,43509,2009-09-06,5,Super moist and yummy! These will be memorable for me. I made them in my baking frenzy the day I went into labor!
158086,43509,2010-01-22,5,Wonderful muffins....they turned out perfect...
93006,43509,2010-02-06,5,"Wow....tender, light and delicious muffins.  Addicting!  Don't like to make changes to recipes when I'm reviewing, but I did make a slight change....put nuts from the topping into the batter, subbed part Splenda for some of the sugar, and FORGOT the egg!  Didn't seem to make a difference at all.  This one's a keeper!"
315055,43509,2010-02-08,5,"WOW!  These are sooo good.  I now know what my staple ""bananas are going to go bad"" recipe is!  I threw in a half a cup of chocolate chips, and they were TDF!"
1581225,43509,2010-04-08,5,Yum! I had some overripe bananas to use and wanted something a bit different to a plain old banana cake. Glad I found these.
1269015,43509,2010-05-14,4,"I vegan-ized these like a few other reviewers have, but mine didn't really come out the way I expected. They were really, really sweet and the banana was very, very mushy. Bummer. But! I did make these once before as written and they were great. I'll just have to keep hunting the perfect vegan muffin down, otherwise these are the best."
146047,43509,2010-05-27,5,Delicious! I didn't make the crumb topping but the muffin itself was wonderful: sweet and moist with a nice high dome. I actually preheated the oven to 425 and turned the temp down to 375 when I put the muffins into the oven to encourage a nice rise. Thanks for posting this recipe!
839492,43509,2011-03-23,5,"Made without crumb topping and reduced sugar by 1/4 c, which still yielded a very sweet, moist (and delicious muffin). I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg & vanilla to make it even more special. Thanks for sharing, these were the best banana muffins I've made thus far."
362983,43509,2011-04-15,5,"These are delicious! I used a little less sugar, using a third brown sugar and two thirds white sugar, also used half butter and half oil. I also cut the topping amounts in half and it was just enough for the dozen muffins. They baked up beautifully and were perfect in exactly 20 minutes! I'll definitely be making these again. Thanks!"
173579,43509,2011-06-08,5,Great Muffins.  Very moist!  Thanks for posting.
350750,43509,2011-09-04,5,These were tasty but better the next morning.  Easy to put together and gave me an excuse to use the falling bananas from the freezer.  Thanks for a great muffin!
307214,43509,2012-01-07,5,"Excellent muffins.  What a surprise to come home and find that DD had ""used up"" those old bananas and made these muffins - what a wonderful daughter and a wonderful muffin.  Only change for next time, I would consider is using a little less sugar and try adding some whole wheat flour - to make them a little healthier."
185926,43509,2012-02-08,5,"Moist and delicious, like portable little banana puddings.  The topping really puts it over the top.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter as per other reviewers comments - thank you all.  We ran out of butter so I used 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil.  Replaced 1/2 cup flour with whole wheat flour.  I also added 1 cup of blueberries because I love them and we had some on hand.  With that addition, I was still able to fit the whole thing into 12 muffin cups.  They were nice and full.  Yum...I will make more tomorrow because I know I'm going to finish eating these by then.  Thank you.  Yes, it's true, it's been a day and all those muffins are gone.  I'm going to have to make more.  But they taste better the second day, there's more of a banana flavor to it and the texture is a little firmer than when they were warm out of the oven.  THANK YOU."
176615,43509,2013-07-02,5,"Really good! I omitted nuts in topping, otherwise made as stated. Only change I&#039;d make next time would be to make 15 muffins. With 12, the topping spilled out onto the pan. Maybe my bananas were larger than normal? Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
198154,43509,2016-07-02,4,"I had 3 really ripe bananas, so this was the perfect recipe to use them up. I made them for DH, as he is the only fan of banana bread/muffins in our house. He wasn't so sure about the crumb topping, but gave the muffins 4 stars."
46660,64015,2005-10-09,5,"This is the best cookie icing I have made yet!  I did have to add A LOT more corn syrup than listed, but other than that it was perfect!  Thanks!"
37305,64015,2005-12-17,5,"This is wonderful stuff!  I've used it for a couple years now and I can't believe I forgot to rate it.  I doubled the recipe this year and we made 5 colors plus the white.  Anytime it got a little thick, we added a few drops of milk.  Thanks very much for sharing!"
56087,64015,2005-12-21,5,"Let me add my 5 stars to what is now a permanent part of my cookie baking.  EASY to prepare, looks awesome on the cookies and tastes great.  What more could you ask for.  Thanks for sharing."
149363,64015,2005-12-21,5,"Fantastic! I made this icing for the cut outs on my Christmas Tray, and it turned out perfectly! Glossy and delicious, easy to make. My 5 year old had a blast painting the icing on and decorating the cookies with this.
Thanks for a keeper!"
230557,64015,2005-12-21,5,"My kids had so much fun using this icing to paint their cookies!  Easy to make, easy to clean up & a beautiful finished cookie.   We added both more milk & corn syrup in order to make it runny enough for painting.  Thanks!"
160974,64015,2006-02-16,5,"What a difference a little corn syrup made! I flavored with almond extract and spread on P4's Butter Cookies. I love the glossy sheen and the way it gets slightly hardened (but no cracks).

Roxygirl"
103876,64015,2006-06-10,5,This turned out just as described.  I'm glad to find this recipe.
324621,64015,2006-08-08,4,"This was an okay recipe. Not exactly what I was looking for, but it was okay."
98919,64015,2006-12-19,5,Used this icing to go with Aunt Paula's Cream Cheese Cut-Out Cookies and they turned out delicious!  Nice and shinny!  Thanks for sharing!
316717,64015,2007-04-24,5,this is exactly what i needed for the sugar cookies i made. i do agree that you'd need to add more milk and corn syrup to thin it up enough to be able to pipe it. or you can leave it as is and spoon the icing onto the cookies..which i did out of ease. not only does it dry perfectly to stack on eachother...more importantly it tastes great. thanks for sharing!
40961,64015,2007-05-02,5,Delicious icing and so much fun to use. I decorated P4's Butter cookies with it. I used food coloring and used a spoon to put it on the cookie. Today I went to the craft store and bought some food paint brushes. I can't wait to try them out with this tasty icing. Thanks.
173314,64015,2007-12-09,5,excellent....we loved this ....used on cut out cookies
185446,64015,2007-12-25,5,"This is the first time I've made a sugar cookie icing that looks professional, tastes good and hardens up the way it's supposed to.  Thanks, Junebug.  I could have used this recipe many sugar cookies ago."
180090,64015,2007-12-26,5,Great icing recipe! It made the cookies look very pretty and was easy to spread with a butterknife. I love how it dries hard so you can stack the cookies! I used clear vanilla extract and it tasted great. Thanks for posting!
32058,64015,2008-08-23,5,I doubled and still need more to frost about 12 cookies.  I would quad next time!  Yummy taste.  Used comnbo of vanilla and almond extract.  Will make again & Again.
620763,64015,2008-10-31,5,"A great sugar cookie icing! Dries shiny and hard just as described, and it's so simple to make. Will definitely use again."
359220,64015,2008-12-13,4,"I halved this recipe into three separate bowls (half-sized recipe in each bowl) and this was a quick recipe to make.  Found that I had to add quite a bit more moisture for it to be spreadable, but it's been pretty dry around here so maybe that's it.  I used butter flavoring instead of vanilla and it was perfect on vanilla sugar cookies- thanks for the great recipe!"
315055,64015,2010-11-26,4,The frosting left a really nice glaze on the cookies and I liked that it was easy to adapt for my so who has multiple allergies (I only substituted the milk for soy).  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it did need about double the amt of milk to make it a spreadable consistency.
8629,64015,2012-11-04,5,This is my go-to sugar cookie frosting.  I sift the confectioner's sugar and usually do need to play around with the amount of milk and corn syrup to get the proper consistency.  I like the taste and the look of the icing on the cookies.
400708,64015,2012-12-22,5,Used this on recipe#11345 in my Holiday cookie tray and it was easy and so yummy.  I didn't have any food coloring (couldn't find it in all of Trinidad) so just left it white and sprinkled with pearl sugar - it's lovely and not to sweet.
176615,64015,2013-07-04,5,Stays glossy but firms up nicely. Used 2t more corn syrup and a touch more milk for spreadable consistency. Used vanilla in red and blue colored icing and almond extract (clear) in white icing. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
185926,64015,2013-12-24,4,"Great recipe.  Came out nice and shiny.  We did add another teaspoon of milk and some coloring.  I like the portion in this recipe.  I made it three times, plain, red and green batches to decorate our Xmas cookies.  Perfect.  If you can find squeeze bottles (like the old fashion ketchup and mustard squeeze bottles at restaurants), and fill them with the different color icings to squeeze onto cookies, makes less of a mess than pastry bags."
199020,64015,2013-12-28,5,Typical sugar cookie icing. Good for what it is!
124249,158832,2006-04-24,5,"Fried potatoes are one of my favorites even though I don't eat them very often. These potatoes had a nice flavor.

Thanks Wlliam ( Uncle Bill) Anatooskin.

Bullwinkle."
37449,158832,2006-04-30,5,Yummy potatoes and onions. I liked the garlic powder too. I made this for dinner and served with spinach and tilapia. Thank you Uncle Bill!
230557,158832,2006-05-02,5,"I hadn't had fried potatoes  in such a long time and this was a very good recipe.  I love the carmalized onion, just enough sweet & spice to make those potatoes delicious.  Thank you!"
229524,158832,2006-06-17,5,Great way to have potatoes during the week.  Great flavor. Only way to make fried potatoes.
278113,158832,2006-06-20,5,I had never added the garlic powder before..and what a difference that made! These are just perfect...and I can not wait to have them again!!
145352,158832,2006-06-20,5,Great comfort food!
36944,158832,2006-06-20,5,Easy and quick to prepare and results in a delicious potato dish.  Thank you for another wonderful recipe Uncle Bill!
169969,158832,2006-06-22,5,Great Recipe. I was out of regular butter so I had to use Dutch butter that is infused with garlic... so they were extra good! Thanks Uncle Bill!
59473,158832,2006-07-20,5,What a great easy way to make fried potatoes. We really enjoyed them and I will be making them this way from now on. Thanks Uncle Bill.
175824,158832,2006-08-30,5,This us the best way to make fried potatoes and onions. Delicious. Thanks Uncle Bill.
426903,158832,2007-02-06,5,"My husband loved these. They are so easy to make, he is always asking for them. Thanks!"
40961,158832,2007-04-09,5,"We had this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. It smelled great and was so easy to put together.The combination of potatoes and onions plus the perfect blend of spices made for a wonderful side dish that was enjoyed but eveyrone, thanks for sharing."
189616,158832,2007-07-25,5,"Worthy more than 5*, I hardly ever go to the trouble making fried potatoes since it always seemed so time consuming, and some wouldn't brown, or underdone. Of course in the past I didn't have a mandoline or quality cookware, which makes the process so much easier with perfect results. Served this with recipe#179863 and recipe#59183"
265954,158832,2007-12-17,5,"Delicious, delicious.  I used 4 medium potatoes, 1/2 an onion, all other ingredients as listed and then fried everything in vegetable oil, since I did not have butter on hand.  I fried the potatoes for 5 minutes first, and then added the onion since onion is thinner and cooks more quickly. I added some chopped scallion for the last 5 minutes of cooking, for color. I served with Ranch Chicken Breast, and Boston baked beans.  Uncle Bill, this also reminds me of a dish my grandmother would prepare.  Thanks for posting!"
29782,158832,2008-01-26,5,Wonderful recipe to have with any meal. I used little red potatoes in this recipe. We had these for breakfast with Recipe #183811 and some homemade breakfast gravy and toast. It was a full filling breakfast meal :) I also want to add that the garlic powder gave it that special taste. :)   Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!
140132,158832,2008-02-20,5,"Oh yum.  I made this to go along side of pork chops.  We really like these potatoes and onions.  I used the leftovers the next Sunday for hash browns, they worked perfectly.  Thank you for such a basic side dish that was great....
Stephanie"
125640,158832,2008-08-10,5,"Very simple, easy, and delicious. I added a little extra salt and garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll cut back a little on the onions and add mushrooms. Thanks for sharing."
203111,158832,2008-11-12,5,"So good...just like Mom used to make!  I reduced this to 1 serving, used Smart Balance in place of butter and a red potato.  It's my new comfort food.  Thanks Uncle Bill!"
969481,158832,2009-01-04,5,"Very tasty! I added a few dashes of season as well, but would be just a great as posted. Thanks for sharing! We'll be making these again."
158086,158832,2009-07-10,5,"Love these potatoes, I have also made them with leftover boiled potatoes, they just cook faster...."
305531,158832,2009-10-21,5,Yum! My DH used to make fried potatoes like this and everyone always loved them. These were so simple and so good! Thanks for sharing Uncle Bill. Made for Cookbook Tag.
168462,158832,2010-02-15,5,These are worth every star I can give. I made these for breakfast this morning for my kids. I think I could have tripled the recipe and there would have been none left they were so good. The only thing I changed was to use half the butter. Thanks for the recipe.
316717,158832,2010-06-13,5,love how easy and quick this was to make. nice easy way to make potatoes w/ out having to have the pain of baking it.
74281,158832,2010-11-08,5,"I really do understand why it pleased you Uncle Bill when your Grandma made this dish. Like you say, it is a simple but tasty side dish that we all loved in my house. I did use fresh garlic and didn't deviate from the recipe. We will have this ofter in our house.... it would even be great for breakfast! I just ordered my copy of your cookbook ""From Uncle Bill's Kitchen"" and I can't wait to try some of the recipes in there!"
362983,158832,2011-03-23,5,"This was awesome and easy. A great, simple side dish! I've made a variation of this by adding thyme and smoked paprika which also gave the dish an extra pop of colour. I'll be making this again. Thanks!"
482376,158832,2012-05-21,5,Can't go wrong with this recipe! Yummy!! The only thing I did differently was to omit the dill. We loved the flavor and crispyness of these potatoes and onions. Note: I sliced my onions thin but they tended to burn. Next time I will slice the onions thicker. Thanks!
226863,158832,2012-12-14,5,Down home cooking!  Reminded me of my grandmother.  We all enjoyed this very much.  Thanks for sharing!
280271,158832,2015-03-04,5,Excellent...I&#039;ve been making this dish for years...except not with the dill...that add a nice new flavor...I used yukon gold potatoes...yum...made for Best of 2014 tag game...
2549237,158832,2015-03-26,4,"This was so easy and quick.  It turned out almost identical to my grandma&#039;s fried potatoes, which is a big bonus in my book.  Nothing seems to be made the same way that my grandmother&#039;s generation and generations before that used to make things.  Sometimes, even though it isn&#039;t necessarily the most healthy way to cook, you just need some good old comfort food.  This hit the ticket on a day when I wasn&#039;t feeling great and just wanted some good ole home cooking.  I made this with Southern Fried Chicken and Asparagus for a great country dinner that my whole family really loved.  Thank you Uncle Bill!"
198154,158832,2017-11-17,4,"Didn't realize that we were out of Dill until the potatoes were already cooking. So, we just left it out. It did take a lot longer than ten minutes for the potatoes to cook. But when they were finally done, they were pretty darn tasty!"
39835,71373,2003-10-22,5,Excellent dinner rolls which went great with soup. Thanks DDW for sharing this wonderful bread recipe which we will be having often.
64934,71373,2003-10-23,5,"I used this recipe to make dinner rolls, and didn't change a thing!  These were excellent and I got 15 rolls out of it, just like you suggested!  We didn't bother brushing the melted butter on top since they were wonderful just the way they were!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, DDW!"
18391,71373,2004-07-17,5,"I loved these rolls! I added some water to my dough, as my flour is somewhat dry .. I have made this with just 2T of sugar instead of 4T, and I liked them better that way .. thanks for posting!"
8629,71373,2004-07-18,5,Wonderful!  I made a regular bread machine loaf. The color and texture were perfect.
172369,71373,2005-04-05,5,First time ever making yeast rolls- so beautiful and delicious. I will be making these again. I followed your directions. Thank you for a great recipe.
64203,71373,2005-08-21,5,"What's there to say that hasn't already been said? This recipe produces the softest most tender and delicious rolls! We gobbled up a whole pan between 6 people in one sitting. I followed the recipe exactly!
Thanks for sharing this addicting and delicious recipe. If you haven't tried it yet, do! It's wonderful and easy!"
88099,71373,2005-10-02,5,"Okay, I'll jump in here.  These were absolutely great.  I am so bread challenged, but these even worked for me.  They turned out HUGE.  The taste and texture were just what I've been looking for.  DH told me I had finally made rolls that taste like his Grandma, and trust me, he has suffered through many tried recipes.  Thanks so much DDW.  I finally have THE KEEPER.  "
37305,71373,2005-10-25,5,"WOW!  Not much to add here.  I made this into rolls to serve with chili and they were fabulous.  The whole family said they were amazing and that they never had rolls so good.  Perfect texture...so soft, but a bit dense inside.  I did add 5 tablespoons of flour and it could have used more because it was extremely sticky after rising.  I think I'll try 1/2 cup next time.  You never know with flour and the weather!  Thanks soooooo much for sharing this recipe.  I can't wait to try the loaf now!"
173579,71373,2005-11-01,4,I made the rolls.  I felt they were just ok.  Didn't have a lot of taste to them.  Thanks for posting.
40961,71373,2005-12-09,5,"I made this today exactly as written for a loaf of bread. It was delicious. Perfect crust and soft, tasty bread. I will make this often, thanks for posting:)"
50969,71373,2005-12-11,4,"i found this to be a very good,and slightly chewy bread.i only added 1/8 cup of sugar.it took 3 hours in my bread machine.as soon as it came out,i cut it and added a little honey butter spread,it was just so warm and soft.this will be made again.thank you for posting. — Dec 8, UPDATE:December 11,2005,made this again using bread machine yeast,and OMG!!! it made such a big difference.the different yeast made the loaf higher,lighter,and oh so much fluffier.and i slightly beat the egg before i added it.i added the ingredients in this order, water,egg,oil,sugar,bread flour,salt,and yeast,and i made a little ""dent"" in one side of the flour and added the salt,the made another ""dent"" on the other side adding the yeast making sure the yeast didn't touch the water. thank you again for posting this wonderful recipe."
47559,71373,2006-11-26,5,"Excellent rolls, and so easy too!  I made a batch for Thanksgiving, and had to make another batch 2 days later to go with the leftovers.  This is going right into my ""Favorites"" cookbook."
145352,71373,2007-01-04,5,very good and very easy. I made these into dinner rolls. I used 1 cup of water in the machine and it was perfect.
394077,71373,2007-01-06,5,Perfect rolls! Soft on the inside and slightly crispy and chewy on the outside.  Perfectly sweeten.  Great recipe.  I made this by hand and had to add about 1/2 cup extra of flour and baked it at 350 for 20 minutes but they came out excellent.  Thank you for the recipe.
29782,71373,2007-04-21,5,Wonderful recipe! I used the dough cycle and let rise alittle over a hour. Great texture and the flavor is  so delicious :yummy:   Thanks so much for sharing the recipe :)
52125,71373,2007-06-22,5,"Kinda late on the review, made dinner rolls for last Christmas. These rolls are to die for, delish.
Thanks DDW...."
529278,71373,2007-07-27,3,"We used this as our base for the Hot Brown sandwiches.  Came out of the bread machine looking beautiful.  Smelled wonderful too.  Tasted fine, but nothing special.  This makes a 2 pound loaf, so if your machine can't do anything that big, you may just want to bake it."
230557,71373,2007-08-27,4,"The texture and softness of this bread is very good.  But like others have reviewed, it's not high in the flavor department.  I used regular flour and had to add another 1/4.  Very easy to put together."
329638,71373,2007-09-26,5,"Fantastic! I made with white whole wheat flour and bread flour, doubled the recipe and made one loaf and one batch of dinner rolls.  Both came out delicious.  Thanks for posting!"
8688,71373,2007-11-15,5,"I haven't tried this as rolls yet, but if the rolls turn out as great as the bread machine loaf, I can't wait to try it!  I used this recipe as my first trial run in my new bread machine and it worked perfectly! There was no need to add extra water or flour to the mix.  The bread rose beautifully and tastes great!  I served my first warm slice with some recipe #265593 and plan to try it also with recipe #90674.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, DDW!"
80998,71373,2007-11-24,5,Absolutly wonderful rolls!  We had this for Thanksgiving.  They were a bigger hit than the turkey as far as my son was concerned.  Thanks.
140132,71373,2007-12-03,5,"I've made both the bread and the rolls....these are delicious.  I'm not the best baker but this is fool proof.....thank you for this great and easy recipe....
Stephanie"
160974,71373,2007-12-03,5,"I've made this twice, making rolls and bread, and they both turned out great. I found the dough very easy to shape after I rubbed a small amount of shortening on my hands (as suggested).Both the rolls and bread were slightly airy and had a  sturdier texture when cooled.  Thanks DDW, for a dough recipe that I will make often.
Roxygirl"
187373,71373,2008-01-01,5,"This doesn't really need another review, but MAN, this was GOOD bread!! I baked some up to serve with the Honey Cinnamon butter I made for Christmas.  This bread was moist, soft and as you can tell from the above picture, makes a huge loaf that rises out of the pan! Will definitely make again. I used my bread machine for all the work, then took it out and put in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!"
199792,71373,2008-01-12,5,I don't think there is anything that I can add. This is a great recipe. I think I will give it a try for dinner rolls. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
189616,71373,2008-02-01,5,A winner. I used 1 c. of wheat and the remainder of white flour.
132383,71373,2008-03-08,5,"I just returned home from a trip to Ireland where we had homemade bread every day. So, I immediately came home and got on zaar to find a recipe.  I pulled out my bread machine, which as been in storage for five years and luckily it still worked! We prepared it last night before we went to bed and had it ready for when we normally have our coffee. I wasn't worried about the egg being out since we keep our house relatively cool. It was AWESOME!  Thank you so much posting this recipe - we will be making this often."
377039,71373,2008-06-15,5,"This gets five stars simply because I did everything WRONG and they still came out great!  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine but, well, dozed off before it went off. So they rose...and rose... and rose.  They rose to fill the bread machine and oozed down around the sides.  When I woke I kinda poured the dough out and made it into rolls, not sure if they'd still work.  I put them in a warm oven for the second rising. Then due to an emergency -- yep you guessed it, they stayed in there for an hour and a half.  They rose (and rose, and rose) again to triple their original size.  I baked them anyway.

They were a hit!  Everyone loved them! Amazing!"
37036,71373,2008-09-24,5,"I love this bread!  I luckily stumbled across this recipe because of Hurricane Ike.  I had gone to several stores in my area before the storm hit and the shelves were empty and there was no bread to be found anywhere.  I decided to go home and make my own bread.  Boy I was glad I did.  Not only did I have bread for after the storm, but I found a great recipe!  I'll be making this recipe over and over again.  Thanks DDW for posting this winner!"
126440,71373,2008-11-28,5,I have used this recipe for both rolls and bread.  Both are great.  I did add one half cup of wheat flour for the rolls this time. Thanks for sharing your great recipe.
173314,71373,2008-12-01,5,loved this... used bread machine once dough combined i added about 1/4 parmesan cheese and a tsp. each garlic powder and italian seasoning..
357358,71373,2010-11-16,5,"This recipe makes a lovely loaf of whiite bread that offers many possibilities. By adding cinnamon & raisins it could be a breakfast bread. Parsley & garlic, it could be a savory bread. Thatks for posting."
808027,71373,2008-12-03,5,"Best rolls ever.  These can't be beat.  Made them in the bread machine for Thanksgiving...super easy.  They rose up so high and were so fluffy.  My whole family gave them kudos and I am already making them again, less than a week later.  Haven't tried a loaf yet, but I am sure that will be equally as good.  Thanks for sharing this AWESOME recipe!!!"
353131,71373,2008-12-05,5,"Made this recipe to use for garlic pull-apart bread. This is easy and shaped beautifully. I rolled into balls,placed in a tube pan and poured melted butter and minced garlic over the top and let it raise for about an hour. When I checked it the rolls had risen to the top of the pan!!! I baked it for about 20 min. My husband and kids were so impressed with this!!! Served with spaghetti!! I am going to make this again today for cinnamon pull-apart bread!!! Thanks!!!!"
485151,71373,2008-12-27,5,I made these rolls for our Christmas Dinner and they turned out great. These were the first successful homemade rolls I've ever made- so I was very happy. The only thing I'll change is next time I'll pat the dough into a rectangle and cut it into squares so I can make even sized rolls easier.
222433,71373,2009-03-20,5,These little babies are sooo good! Eat them with soup or mop up gravy with them....fantastic. Thanks DDW!
362983,71373,2009-04-12,5,"Oh my gosh. I almost still can't believe it, but I've finally done it. This is truly the first time I've made a bread with my bread machine that ISN'T DENSE! I have had no luck with my bread machine since I got it. All I wanted was a nice fluffy bread but I just couldn't make one... until now! I can't even begin to describe how happy I am. I followed the recipe almost exactly, though the only changes were that I cut down the sugar to 2TB and added a 1/4 tsp more yeast to see if I'd get a nicer rise compared to my past attempts. The loaf rose pretty well in the bread machine, and when I shaped my little dinner rolls (ended up with 16 balls of dough), boy did they rise after that! And they baked SO beautifully! A little brush of melted butter afterwards and they were golden and shiny and beautiful. The moment I picked up a light, super soft roll, I already knew that this recipe was a winner. So soft, so fluffy and light, and the flavour - wow! Just perfect. A little bit of butter in this warm roll and I was in heaven. I gobbled up 3 of them tonight and had to stop myself from eating the rest! We only have one single roll left. Hopefully I'll be able to eat it tomorrow, unless someone gets to it before me! Thank you so much for this recipe. I have faith in my bread machine - finally - and I am no longer destined for dense, heavy breads. No more!! :)"
185446,71373,2009-04-14,0,"After 241 good reviews, does this need another?  Followed directions to the T, and the bread turned out perfectly and tastes great.  Sounds like reviewers have found a winner of a recipe here.  Thanks for sharing both bread and roll directions."
368078,71373,2009-05-10,5,"Perfect!  We made a loaf, just as directed in our bread machine.  It turned out wonderful, and everyone loved it.  Thanks DDW!"
928301,71373,2009-05-14,3,I have tried this twice and both times it came out dry.  I'm quite disappointed.
59163,71373,2009-11-06,5,Very good rolls. easy to make and very yummy right out of the oven! Will be making these over and over.
264017,71373,2009-12-08,4,"#272nd reviewer! We really liked these rolls as they were beautiful, light and so very tender! The only thing I'd change next time is to add about 1/4 tsp. more salt. Each bite seemed just a tad bland, needing an extra something. I did sub one cup of the white bread flour for whole wheat to give it a touch of wholesomeness. I will be making these again for sure. So simple and comforting! Thanks DDW!"
222970,71373,2009-12-29,5,"Good basic roll dough. Perhaps a bit rich for a white bread with the egg in it, but would certainly be delicious! The amount of salt was just right."
439797,71373,2010-02-12,5,"These are soooo good!  I cut the recipe in half because I have a small breadmaker, and then make it into 9  balls that fit into a pie plate.  Cook for 14 minutes, and they are perfect!

Feb 2010 - made it in my bread maker.  Half recipe.  Came out great!"
540346,71373,2010-02-28,5,I made these dinner rolls for a party we had and they were raved about.  I got 12 large rolls from this recipe.  I will definitely make them again!
810787,71373,2010-03-23,5,Wow! Loved it! I really thought it wasn't going to lift but it did. It was a denser bread so I really liked it.
138429,71373,2010-08-05,5,Excellent recipe. Followed the recipe for Dinner Buns and they turned out perfect.
37779,71373,2010-12-05,4,"I used this recipe in my bread machine. Made a good basic white bread. I had a thick slice with a hot bowl of soup, for lunch. Very nice. Thanks."
937635,71373,2011-03-26,5,"Really good, simple bread recipe that doesn't use dairy and is still very moist and delicious. 4 stars, DDW! Thanks for the keeper"
76951,71373,2012-04-12,5,"Oh my gosh.  I can't believe I haven't rated this.  I make this bread ALL the time.  This is my bread of choice for paninis and for toast.  Of course, no one can resist slicing it warn out of the bread machine with butter slathered on it."
383346,71373,2013-06-18,5,I made dinner rolls and used 1/8 cup of sugar.  I didn&#039;t want them too sweet.  They have a light texture.  Great taste.  Thanks DDW :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game
91392,71373,2013-12-28,0,"Easy to make the dough in the bread machine, then cook rolls in the oven.  Dough is a little sticky to handle, but made beautiful rolls that rose really well."
298447,71373,2014-11-27,5,"Since I have been watching my carbs, i haven&#039;t had bread in few months. Being Thanksgiving, I decided to not really worry about carbs and have a little &quot;cheat day&quot; (but did use Splenda in place of sugar).  This bread = completely worth it!  Thank you!"
1581225,71373,2017-05-15,5,"These turned out great! I made them as rolls. The dough was the right consistency in the bread machine. They were sweet, but tasty. The kids loved them with dinner and have asked me to make them again."
400708,71373,2018-09-03,5,"Light fluffy and so pretty to look at, and to top it off so easy to make. Everyone at our get together raved about them. I'm planning on following reviewer Viclynn's freezing directions, so that I'll always have some on hand"
37036,75302,2004-04-15,5,Great flavor and so easy to put together!  The only change I made was combining the cooked pasta and mushroom soup together before pouring it into the baking dish.  Will make again!
64934,75302,2004-05-05,5,"Thank you Jellyqueen and Mrs. Geraldine!  This was a wonderful casserole.  I used a bit more ground beef.. probably about a pound and a half.  Also, I didn't have any angel hair pasta so I used spaghetti.  My can of tomatoes was 28 ounces, but it all worked out very well.  The only other thing I did differently was to add a bit of  fresh garlic when I was browning the meat!  The end result was absolutely delicious and I'll certainly be making it again!"
89831,75302,2004-06-23,5,"This casserole was just delicious! The only change I made was, I added about 1 Tbsp fresh chopped garlic in with the onions, celery and bell pepper, and used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned. I didn't have and angel hair pasta on hand, so I used spaghetti. Thank you Jellyqueen for such a wonderful casserole recipe, we really enjoyed it. I will definately be making this again, it was so good....Kittencal :)"
136997,75302,2004-07-10,5,This was delicious. I used a package of medium egg noodles instead. My husband took seconds even though he was full from firsts. Good sign it's a keeper.
101034,75302,2004-07-11,5,This is on the top of my list as GREAT comfort food!! Absolutely delicious. Thanks Jellyqueen for one of the best casseroles we have ever eaten.
158086,75302,2004-11-24,5,okay add me to the list who loves this recipe...very simple but tasty..i did not let mine simmer a whole hour as was pressed for time.  But still turned out fabulous...
76951,75302,2004-07-25,4,"Good recipe, easy to prepare, using ingredients that are usually in everyone's pantry.  Easy to increase ingredients for making extra for a freezer meal.  My son loved it and will be taking the leftovers in his lunch.  Thanks for sharing."
60992,75302,2004-08-12,5,"Now I know what all the fuss is about! This is total comfort food. My DH inhaled 2 large plate fulls and I was ordered to amke this again. I read all the reviews and from them I took this with me before preparing it. I broke the pasta into thirds before cooking them. I used brown sugar instead of pickle juice. I left out the mushrooms (so the kids would eat it) and after I had all but the cheese layered, I took a spatula and gently went into the noodles so some sauce would seep down. The results were fantastic! Another must try Zaar recipe!"
52543,75302,2004-08-21,5,"This was delicious! I excluded the mushrooms (grandkids still drove me crazy by picking out tiny little mushroom pieces from the soup), I used spaghettini and a cheddar/jack combo. Thanx JellyQueen!    "
74652,75302,2004-10-07,3,I changed my rating of this since although it was not enjoyed at first it was much better the next day.  I think the problem with the noodles being mushy was my fault as I must have overcooked them...I will try it again.
59473,75302,2004-10-26,5,WOW what a great tasting casserole. I took the advice of previous posters and broke the spaghetti into  thirds. I also mixed it with the cream of mushroom soup and added some garlic to the sauce. This is a keeper for sure. Thanks Jellyqueen.
47559,75302,2004-11-22,4,"A very good hamburger casserole.  Everyone in my family gobbled it up.  With the brown sugar and Worcestershire, it reminded me of a sloppy joe taste, but the mushroom soup made it different.  I followed the advice of others and broke the angel hair in thirds before cooking, and combined the pasta, sauce and soup before placing in the casserole.  The recipe didn't say to cover the sauce while cooking for an hour, but I was concerned the liquid would evaporate and it would dry out, so I did cover it for most of the hour.  I'm glad I did, because I would not have wanted it any more dry.  I'll definitely make this again."
137911,75302,2005-06-21,4,"This was good - kinda reminded me of sloppy joes on pasta. My 9 yo daughter wasn't crazy about the mushrooms or the taste. I read one review that mentioned using 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of 1...I agree with that. I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic as some suggested...a good add. Also, I only cooked the meat mixture on stove-top for 30 minutes an that was plenty. Any more time and it would have been too dry for the casserole."
97579,75302,2005-07-05,4,"This was good, but I think next time I am going to omit the brown sugar and the worchestire sauce.  I tasted the worchestire more than I would have liked.  Will make again!  Thanks"
149363,75302,2005-12-06,5,"This was really delicious and what a kid pleaser!
Simple, easy to follow recipe.
Thanks for posting!"
81611,75302,2006-02-21,3,"Well, after all the rave reviews, I was a bit disappointed that this didn't knock my family's socks off. My kids trudged through it, not even finishing. My dh said it tasted like Chef Boyardee. I thought it tasted so much like my favorite sloppy joe recipe that it didn't seem right with noodles. Since salt & pepper amounts weren't specified, I added 1/2 t salt and 1/8 t pepper, and that seemed fine."
199792,75302,2006-06-13,4,This is very good. It was a bit short on salt and pepper (my fault) but that can be easily adjusted next time or at the table. I did use spaghetti. I used more cheese than called for due to the dish I chose to bake it in. I wish that I would have used fresh mushrooms! We will make this one again. Thank you for the recipe.
169969,75302,2006-12-11,5,"WooHoo! Quick and easy! A total Man pleasing meal. Hearty and Delicious! Super easy to put together. I used about 2 pounds of ground beef since I had to use up what I had in the fridge. I used a combination of Mancheago, Cheddar and Parmesan Cheeses with Tubettini pasta. Delicious!"
182624,75302,2007-01-08,4,"YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  I loved this, and so did DH!  The ONLY change I would POSSIBLY make would be a bit less sugar, and DH disagrees with me on that one!  A great and easy dish to make whenever comfort food is called for.  Thanks!!"
140132,75302,2007-04-14,4,"This casserole was really good.  Simple to put together and we all liked it.  I will be making this again.  I liked the addition of the cream of mushroom soup, it really added a diffrent dimension to this pasta dish.  I did use thin spaghetti, but it didn't seem to effect the end result......Stephanie"
447123,75302,2007-09-04,5,This is just heavenly. Like someone else said I was really suprised how far you can stretch the ground beef!!!! In my hunger I mixed the mushroom soup in with the tomatoes. But it still turned out divine!! Really a crowd pleaser. Also I used some left over hamburgers from last nights dinner and it was perfect. Thank you for a new staple to my dinners!!
265954,75302,2007-09-28,5,"Very, very good. I used stewed tomatoes to cut the skillet cooking time to half an hour, used 16 oz. of tomato sauce, not the 8 oz., which would have been too little sauce for our taste, and also mixed a light coating of olive oil with the pasta before pouring the sauce over it. I do plan on using more than 6 oz. of pasta next time, and I also plan on using a mozzarella/cheddar mix. Thanks."
229850,75302,2007-12-07,5,"This was yummy and easy, thanks so much for the new recipe !"
232480,75302,2007-12-22,4,"I absolutely loved this and would have given 5 stars, but my dh wouldn't even finish his portion.  He said he thought the soup was what he didn't like about it, so I may try it again and either mix the soup with the pasta or leave it out altogether."
43083,75302,2007-12-23,5,OMG...I made this y'day at my parents for my family and a 9x13 pan was devoured! I omitted the bell peppers and the celery and used brown sugar. I also mixed everything together except the cheese and it came together beautifully! Thank you sooooo much for a delicious recipe Jellyqueen!! :)
13483,75302,2008-04-18,5,This is not a sauce over pasta in the traditional way nor is it a meatloaf.  But it sure is easy to make and good to eat.  Can't add much more to what has been said except to say thanks for posting this Jellyqueen.
294000,75302,2008-06-26,5,"I love this recipe.  What a difference the soup makes... different flavor from your usual casserole.  I didn't have celery and I hate mushrooms so I threw in a can of chopped, green chiles.  I also did a quick sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  I didn't simmer for as long as stated but it still turned out wonderful.  My 3-year-old loved it as well.  Great leftovers, for potlucks, OAMC, etc.  Thanks... this goes in the ""favorites."""
377039,75302,2008-06-27,5,"Absolutely fantastic.  It was very greasy, but I think I added too much cheese.  Next time I will carefully get every little bit of grease off the meat, and use less (or reduced fat) cheese.  This tasted incredible."
80998,75302,2008-07-27,5,"My family has made a similar recipe for some time, but no one writes anything down in my family, so it seems the recipe has changed over the years.  This taste like I remember.  I used ground beef this time, but this is also great with sausage.  Thanks for restoring a childhood favorite to its former glory."
620763,75302,2008-12-06,5,"This was delicious. I omitted the celery and mushrooms, and used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce. I also used thin spaghetti instead of the angel hair."
532289,75302,2009-03-05,5,This was good for such an easy casserole.  I was in a hurry so I wasn't able to saute the sauce as long as I wanted but it was a nice and moist casserole.  The best part is my two kids who don't each much of anything ate it without complaint.  My three year old ate two bowls.  Thanks for sharing.
1122161,75302,2009-07-18,5,Great casserole! Loved the sauce flavor and the addition of mushroom soup. Also I rinsed the broken cooken noodles before layering in the pan so they would be easy to serve and not stick together. Thanks for posting!
111291,75302,2009-08-16,5,yummy!  perfect comfort food.  thanks for posting.
135887,75302,2009-11-27,4,My family liked this.  It was easy to put together.  I used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom and left out the mushrooms for DS.
810787,75302,2011-08-28,4,"I liked this better than my husband. He thought it was bland. I used the angel hair pasta, but think elbow macaroni would be better."
383346,75302,2012-03-13,5,"wonderful recipe.  I used macaroni.  And I used a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes.  I used a little bit more of each veggies (celery, pepper, onion).  And I used fresh mushrooms that I added at the same time as the previous veggies.  The mushroom soups adds a wonderful taste to the whole dish.  It gives a lot and it's perfect for the lunches at work/school.  Thanks Jellyqueen :)  Made for All you can cook buffet"
218535,75302,2012-04-24,5,A keeper.
1581225,75302,2013-05-15,4,"The first time I made this I didn&#039;t enjoy it as much. I remember the worcestershire was too much for me. The second time I halved the worcestershire and it was much better. A lovely, comforting and enjoyable dish, thank you."
55578,75302,2014-07-10,4,Nice casserole!  DH loved it.
37779,75302,2014-09-07,5,Family and I enjoyed this casserole. I used chopped tomatoes with chipotle and that added a slight  smokey flavor to the tangy sauce. Thanks for sharing.
198154,75302,2014-09-12,4,"I made this for tonight&#039;s dinner. I actually started it the night before. I did the first five steps and put it in the fridge. When I got home from work tonight I cooked the pasta and put it in my large casserole dish,topped with the soup followed by the sauce and cheese and popped it in the oven. Easy.  DD wasn&#039;t sure if she liked it at first but we all agree, the more we ate, the more we liked it."
298447,75302,2014-09-14,5,Hubs really enjoyed the sweetness of the ground beef mixture and had 2 large servings for dinner...said he just couldn&#039;t resist.  I am sure i will be reminded to make this many times over.  Thanks!
37305,43908,2002-11-19,5,"Wow, these were soooo good.  We had them as a side dish instead of an appetizer.  The whole family loved them and they were pretty easy to make (even with rubbing the oil all over them, cause I couldn't find my pastry brush!).  I only used 3 potatoes because they were huge and they ended up being the perfect side dish size for the 6 of us.  Thanks for sharing...theses were fabulous."
52543,43908,2003-02-27,5,"I've never made potato skins before ...but I will definitely be making these again! However.......I made the mistake of using my Pampered Chef cheese grater & fresh parmesan; since it wasn't grated fine enough, it was difficult to ""brush"" on the skins & when I turned them upside down on the baking sheet, a lot of it fell out. Next time, I'll use the grated parmesan in the can or grate the fresh with my microplaner.  "
37636,43908,2004-09-01,5,"These are excellent, and taste quite similar to the ones I usually make, although I cook those under the broiler. Baking at this temp gives close to the same result, with a nice crunch to the skins. I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for posting!"
131021,43908,2007-01-03,5,"These were outstanding, fabulous, a keeper all the way. I liked them better than any I have ever had at a restaurant. I used small potatoes and then cut them into quarters. The oil mixture truly is the key to these wonderful potatoes. I made a big batch so I tripled the recipe and now I have a few leftovers. Yum."
29782,43908,2007-02-05,4,"Narrowed this down for 2 people. Turned out really good. I added a Tbs. of minced garlic instead of garlic powder to the mixture.
Great little appetizer! Thanks for sharing!"
316717,43908,2007-07-22,5,we enjoyed this very much. just like the restaurants if not better because of the oil you brush on. thanks for sharing!
59780,43908,2007-08-07,5,I made these as a special treat for DH and we all enjoyed them! thanks for posting!
248023,43908,2007-10-10,5,"What's not to love??? Hot crispy potatoes, creamy cheese, bacon and lots of sour to dip in?  This is the best (and easiest) potato skin recipe ever... We are addicted... I serve these at every football party we host!   Thanks for sharing!!!"
229524,43908,2008-01-21,5,"WOW, these are FANTASTIC!!!  Made them for the play-off games on Sunday.  Loved the coating for the skins :)  The skins came out nice and crunchy.  Will definitely make for the Super Bowl."
132383,43908,2008-04-06,5,These were some of the best potato skins I have ever had...thanks so much for posting!
140132,43908,2008-06-25,5,Winner of a recipe.  I made these for my family and my DS (5 yrs old) asked me what happened to the inside of his potato!!!  He was thoroughly confused until he started eating his.  Delicious.  We all got a chuckle out of that and devoured our potate skins.  Thank you for posting.
64583,43908,2009-01-11,5,We just loved these potato skins.  I made them exactly per your recipe and they couldn't have been better.  Great flavor on the skins and the bacon and cheddar inside was so yummy.
355637,43908,2009-01-22,4,"Very good! I totally forgot to dip them, but they were good as is!"
353131,43908,2009-02-17,5,Made for kids. Used butter instead of the oil.Broiled the skins first. Then added toppings and broiled again. Wonderful recipe. I think the flavored butter really added to it!WIll make again
222433,43908,2009-02-21,5,"Just figured out I never reviewed this. I made it for new years eve. Really, really good. Definitely will go into make again file."
653438,43908,2009-06-28,5,These were fabulous! I made these along with Recipe#85201 and will be making these quite often. Used the potato filling for corn chowder soup so everything was used. Thank you!
439797,43908,2009-11-28,5,My husband says these were the best potato skins ever!  So crispy and delicious.  I will make them again soon.
15521,43908,2009-12-30,5,"Apparently I saw what I wanted to see when I chose this recipe.  For some reason, I believed this was a sweet potato variation on the good old potato skin appetizer.  I went ahead and made them with the sweet potatoes I had bought, and served them to my teenage daughter and her friends.  They were quite good.  The only problem I had was that too much potato came off when I scooped it out, leaving the skins a little thin.  I patted some of the sweet potato back on the skin and they worked fine. Another ""accidental"" hit.  Sometimes I make myself laugh."
173314,43908,2010-02-07,5,yummy! forgot the parmesan cheese but was great! thanks so much
226863,43908,2010-02-14,5,Yummy!  Really easy and delicious!  Thanks for sharing your easy recipe.
1506604,43908,2010-03-04,4,"It was okay, there was an excess of oil, and too salty. I used turkey bacon and i don't know if that made a difference. I'll try one more time, there has to be a secret way dig out the potato because it took me FOREVER!!"
227607,43908,2010-10-21,5,These were VERY good.  They were as good or better than at any restaurant.  I am going to make these the next time my husband smokes a pork butt and put some of that meat in them like the local barbeque restaurant does.
135887,43908,2011-02-06,5,Super yummy!  Made as directed.
88099,43908,2011-12-24,4,"These were just wonderful and so full of flavor because of the vegetable oil combination.  I baked at 450 and so glad I did as they were very toasted for the stated baking time.  I lost the cheese from inside when I turned them over to bake the second 8 minutes, but not sure that mattered. Loved the bacon and cheddar cheese and I added the optional green onions and DH added the optional sour cream.  Will be making these again.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for ""Let's Party 2011"""
222564,43908,2012-01-22,5,Absolutely scrumptious!
447123,43908,2016-04-25,5,Love love love this stuff!!! I think what really hit it out of the park was the Parmesan cheese. I will make them again and again. Thanks!
7108,50144,2005-12-02,5,"I give this 10 stars!  Oh my goodness, was this soup ever good!  My dinner guests asked for seconds.  The broth is fairly thin while cooking until you add that cream cheese then viola, out comes a tasty, thick and creamy soup.  I added some salt and pepper to taste.  I also used cream of celery soup instead.  I topped with some shredded cheddar, along with the bacon and chives.  Next time I will make more bacon, personal preference.  I cooked this on Low for about 3 hours then on High for about 5 hours then added the cream cheese and went back down to Low setting for about 1 hour.  I served this with slices of a baked ham and cheese sandwich and some sour dill pickle spears.  It's freezing cold here and this recipe was the perfect warming element.  Wonderful recipe; thank you so much for posting!"
28649,32058,2002-07-01,5,This cake has a good combination of flavors.  I didn't have any vanilla pudding so I used banana cream pudding instead.  It was very light.  I will make this again as it is a good cake for the summer.
169969,50144,2005-12-09,5,I needed a recipe for lunch for someone who works outside in the bitter cold (thermos)that would be ready and hot at 5 AM to throw together. This recipe fit the bill. He said it was delicious! I put the bacon pieces and chives in a plastic baggie and he added them as he ate the soup. I love the ease of this recipe! Very simple and still has wonderful flavors!!! Thank  you for posting!
53932,50144,2005-12-10,5,"This is very good!  As I was eating it I was thinking it would taste even better with onions--Sheesh, I left them out!  I did use ham instead of bacon and sprinkled a little shredded cheddar on the soup when serving.  "
119466,50144,2005-12-15,5,This was delicious and so simple. It was nice to have the soup simmering all day with only the addition of cream cheese  left to complete the dish. I did add a couple of handfuls of shredded sharp cheddar along with the cream cheese which added extra flavor and thickened the texture nicely. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
98919,50144,2005-12-20,5,"Made this last night and me and my husband thought that this was very tasty.  After following the cooking directions, I drained a good deal of the liquid and then mashed the potatoes in the crockpot before adding the cream cheese.  I also added about 1 1/2 cups of sour cream and gradually poured back some of the liquid that I had taken out. (The rest I froze.)  I added 2 lbs of hamburger also, which I do once in awhile to my potato soup...I think it would be just as good without it.  Used Lawry's Garlic Salt and Morton's Nature's Sesoning and added 1/2 stick of butter...VERY GOOD AND EASY!!  Thanks for sharing! "
168462,50144,2006-01-17,5,This was a hit in my house. In order to reduce calories I skipped the cream cheese. I used my hand blender and roughly pureed the soup. Thanks for such an easy recipe.
184723,50144,2006-02-06,5,"I made on the stove top because we just moved and I hadn't unpacked my crockpot yet.  I cooked the bacon, sauteed the onion in the bacon drippings then added the rest like directed and ended up simmering for over an hour and thickened it up a bit with cornstarch.  We topped with cheddar and green onions.  DH loved this recipe!"
331557,50144,2006-10-20,5,I will add to the chorus that this was fantastic and a big hit in my house.  I followed the instructions exactly with the exception of adding pepper at the beginning and it turned out fabulous.  If you have problems with the cream cheese melting make sure to cut it up small and plan to put it in about 30-45 minutes before serving to give it time to all melt.
74652,50144,2007-01-05,3,This tasted pretty good but seemed to break down and seperate leaving a consistancy we didn't like.  We also did not like the addition Cream of Chicken soup in it.  Maybe Cream of celery soup would have been better. I might try it again with the cream of celery soup and it was very easy to make. Thanks for sharing!
51011,50144,2007-01-26,0,"I made a batch of this last weekend, and accidentally ruined it (a bag of brown sugar fell into it).  Wanted to post my comments so I could remember to remake it soon.  I was really looking forward to it.  Thanks for sharing!"
251917,50144,2007-02-05,5,"Delicious!! This was easy to make - my hubby peeled the potatoes, I cut them and my 4yr old tossed them in the crockpot!! In the last 30 minutes I added some cooked ham because I needed to use it up - yummy! Thank you for such a wonderful, easy and filling recipe!!"
80998,50144,2007-04-10,3,"Very good soup.  It was super simple to make.  However, my husband and I both thought that it felt like something was missing.  I will add abit more onions next time and maybe some other seasonings.  This is comfort soup and will be great on a cold day."
111291,50144,2007-10-24,4,"This is good soup, however, I did have to add some spices to give it more flavor.  I added some seasoned salt and pepper.  Also, I added the bacon while it was cooking.  Thanks for posting."
203325,50144,2007-11-13,5,"This chowder was so easy to make, with so few ingredients, it is hard to believe it was so good!  My daughter does not like onions, so I chopped them up fine and they pretty much disintegrated into the chowder.  They added a great flavor but she never knew they were in there!"
529278,50144,2007-11-17,3,"This had a good flavor, but we feel it needs some work to be more to our taste.  We added the cream cheese and then stirred it up until it was blended in, but after doing that, we wondered if the directions actually meant to put the soup in to a blender.  There was too much broth in it, and next time we will cut the potatoes smaller, which should help make thicker.  The cheese we added on top and then stirred in did help make it a bit thicker.  We topped with cheese, bacon, and green onions.  I may add some sour cream on top next time, too.  I do think there will be a next time, we just need to work on thickening it up to fit our tastes."
482376,50144,2007-11-19,5,"My kids went crazy over this soup. I made it on a Saturday, refrigerated it, and then served it for lunch on Sunday. I really think that the flavor and consistency was better the next day (I had tasted it when it was finished on Sat. night). Sprinkling it with bacon was the icing on the cake. Yummy!!"
125640,50144,2007-12-12,5,"This soup was delicious. I used cream of chicken with herbs soup, reduced-fat cream cheese, and added 1/2 tsp pepper. Great, simple recipe. Perfect for a cold winter night. Will make this often. Thanks for sharing."
294000,50144,2008-01-07,5,"Half the neighborhood gathered in a house across the street during some extreme weather and tornado activity.  Fortunately I had this cooking throughout the day.  I went home, grabbed my crockpot and ran back to my neighbor's basement.  The whole crowd gave it rave reviews!  Thanks for making a rough night a little more bearable!  I'll make this often in the future... regardless of the weather."
180090,50144,2008-06-02,5,Such a great easy recipe! Even my husband who doesn't like cream cheese enjoyed this. Thank you!
579298,50144,2008-09-04,4,"Very easy, very delicious - and it still tastes great the next day for lunch!! I used Onion Powder instead of fresh onion. It turned out great!!"
318235,50144,2008-10-07,4,"I made this yesterday morning so that I would have dinner ready to eat at the end of a yucky work Monday. I came home at lunch and I could smell it before I even unlocked the door! Overall the taste was great, I didn't add any spices while it was cooking which in hindsight would have been better I think. I did add a can of drained whole kernel corn that I thought was a nice addition. I added paprika, salt, pepper, and some seasoning salt after blending and served with the bacon and chives as suggested. The only complaint I have is that mine after blending was more like a potato puree, or even mashed potatoes. It was WAY to thick to actually be a soup or chowder but the taste was very good anyways. I served this with salad and some hearty homemade bread. Thanks for an easy but delicious meal at the end of my day!"
353131,50144,2008-10-09,5,"I made this for my DD(7) who adores potato soup. I took out some of the potatoes and mashed then added them back to thicken it. I also added celery salt and black pepper. Served in bread bowls. It was SO GOOOOOD!!
DH liked it really well also and took some leftovers to work today. My DD(10)and DS(9) wouldn't  try it."
49304,50144,2009-01-23,5,"Very easy to make. I halfed the recipe, added 1 stalk celery & extra onion also a little garlic powder & pepper. This recipe does need the little extras. My DDIL also DGDIL has made this recipe several times before I did, (I gave them the recipe.) We ate it at out DDIL. They also added celery & 1 or 2 carrots.
My DH loved the chowder, I will be making this again."
810787,50144,2009-11-16,5,"We really liked this ""as is"". I wouldn't change a thing...super yummy!"
426903,50144,2010-02-10,5,"This was delicious!!! When I went to throw in the cream of chicken soup, I realized that I had none. So I threw in a can of cream of mushroom instead and it still turned out tasty. I also only had a few hours so I cooked it on high and I misread the directions and put the cream cheese in with everything else, whoops! Still turned out delicious. Thanks for posting."
15521,50144,2010-11-18,5,Yummy!  Very easy and the finished product is delicious!  I used cream of celery soup and vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and it was a big hit.  Very creamy (used reduced fat cream cheese) and flavorful.  Will definitely make again!
191533,50144,2011-03-28,4,"Very delicious; but needs tweaking. The cream cheese doesn't stir in well and the soup is much too thin, so I run a stick-blender right in the crockpot after adding softened cream cheese, which takes care of both problems. Then, to add texture back into the soup, I put in canned corn."
2041603,50144,2011-10-26,5,"We loved this! Added a few more potatoes, used onion powder, and made our own broth using sodium free bullion. Topped it off with turkey bacon and it was quite tasty!"
407007,50144,2012-11-16,5,Amazing! :) I used a package of frozen hashbrowns for the potatoes... even easier ;) and I used all low-fat ingredients. Delicious! Great for those cold nights. Thank you so much for sharing!
2549237,50144,2013-01-28,3,"This was a good base recipe but my husband and I both felt like it was missing something.  I added shredded carrots, bacon, garlic powder and pepper about an hour before serving and that helped a little but we still felt like something was missing compared to the potato chowders we get in restaurants.  I will have to fuss with this a little to find the perfect combination for our family.  Thanks stacylu for a good start."
285039,50144,2014-09-22,5,Quick and tasty!  I used low fat cream cheese.
81611,31750,2004-07-17,5,"This is my 2nd time to make these. I left out the vanilla this time, just followed the recipe exact, and I thought the flavor was even better. I almost knocked off a star b/c they don't hold together for me, but the taste is right around 10 stars, so...
and when I added fresh blueberries they fell apart more but tasted even better. My little family (2 adults, 4yo and 2yo) ate up all but one waffle."
56087,31750,2004-10-08,5,"These have pretty much become my Grandsons Friday morning meal.  I found it when I couldn't find my old standby one morning and these are now the New standby.. After reading other reviews, I did change the sugar to 2 T's instead of tsp.  Outstanding.. thanks for sharing."
138429,31750,2005-01-07,5,"Oh my, these are wonderful. The recipe I have searched for -- for years. I made them for my grandson when he was staying with us while going to football camp. He told his mom that Grama made the most awesome waffles. (that says a lot for a 15 yr old) I did't change a thing. Thank you!"
101823,31750,2005-02-12,5,"Wonderfully crisp waffles with great flavor. Easy, quick and yummy. Who could ask for more? ***editted to add***I reheated the leftover waffles in the toaster and had a great breakfast for a couple of days later.  These were perfect waffles."
158086,31750,2005-02-21,5,Very easy recipe...puffed up beautiful....a real keeper
227607,31750,2006-04-15,4,These were just ok for us.  The taste was pretty good but we like a thicker waffle.  These came out more like pancakes. I give 4 stars because the taste was pretty good and it is just personal preference for the texture/thickness.
377581,31750,2007-01-06,4,"I served the waffles with real maple syrup. They were very easy to put together and I'll grant that they were airy and fluffy and tasty, but not the best waffles I've ever had. Though I will probably make them again. Thanks for posting."
222055,31750,2007-01-15,5,I think you are right! These are the best. They are soooo good. I will be making them again and again for breakfast. I am also excited to be able to try them for Recipe #136739. They remind me of the soft home-made waffles my dad used to make. Thank you *Elaine*!!!
173579,31750,2007-01-30,5,These are the best waffles you will ever put in your mouth.  So tasty and delicious!  Will be making these from now on.  Thanks for posting such a fabulous recipe.
64203,31750,2007-03-01,5,"These were great! There isn't much more that I can say that hasn't already been said... I added a dash of vanilla, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.
Thanks!"
182624,31750,2007-06-18,4,"I made these for breakfast on Father's Day per DH's request.  They were very good!  A bit more time consuming to make than other waffles, but well worth the extra effort.  I served them with a homemade peach sauce and they were a hit!  Thanks for sharing!"
37779,31750,2007-06-26,4,"A good, basic, all-purpose waffle recipe. This does take a little effort but produces tender waffles with a nice crust. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
92886,31750,2007-07-08,5,"These ""won"" my waffle tasting experiment.  I made 5 different waffle recipes and this one edged out the others.  The others had great qualities as well, but since my ""tasters""  prefer non fussy food, this recipe was prefered due to just being a nice light, uncomplicated, tasty waffle."
64583,31750,2007-07-29,5,Great waffles - baked up nicely with just the right amount of crispness.  Thanks for posting.
177933,31750,2007-08-22,5,"Just adding one more glowing review!  I've had a belgum waffle maker for awhile and haven't used it, so tried this recipe out with it this morning and it was a hit...there is no need to go looking for a better recipe, this is wonderful.  We all enjoyed!  Thanks!"
316717,31750,2007-11-02,5,i've tried 3 waffle recipes and so far this is the best. a little more work than the basic waffle recipe but so worth it. this will be my standby waffle recipe to use from now on.
231054,31750,2008-01-03,5,"These waffles sure have the right name!!!  They ARE the best!  My husband wanted one of the ""Waring Pro Waffle Makers"" for Christmas and Santa complied.  So we tried this recipe last night for dinner and had the lightest, fluffiest and ""bestest"" Belgium waffles ever.  They were extremely easy to prepare and our new waffle maker worked like a charm.  It's an appliance I would highly recommend -- pretty fool proof.  Thank you, Elaine for sharing this great recipe.  I'm going to tape it to the inside of one of my kitchen cabinet doors!"
140132,31750,2008-02-21,5,"We love waffles on Sunday mornings.  (who am I kidding, we love them ALL the time...lol)  I made these and they turned out perfect, crisp outside and soft inside....delicious.  thank you for posting....Stephanie"
188119,31750,2008-11-29,5,Very good! light and fluffy!  All I did was ad some vanilla and it was great.  Thanks a lot :)
359220,31750,2009-01-06,3,"Easy batter to mix right up, tasted good, but not a whole lot of flavor to them.  Would have added either more sugar or a touch of vanilla so they taste a bit more like you get at a restaurant.  Thanks for posting."
121185,31750,2009-02-08,1,"Sorry!  I am in the minority on this one.  The batter was SO thin and the end result almost tasted ""fried"" due to the high butter content and the waffles were so too thin with no body to them.  We ended up pitching the whole bowl and starting over..."
470351,31750,2009-02-28,5,"DEELISH!!!!!!  Aside from the fact that I never managed to thicken my egg whites (how long do you beat it anyway?), this was the lightest, fluffiest, perfectly cooked waffle I've ever made.  I added a dash or two of Vanilla extract.....everyone loved it!  Perfect recipe."
18391,31750,2009-03-19,5,"Excellent waffles! Very light and airy. I will try reducing the butter next time because although they taste great, they aren't exactly healthy. Thanks for a great recipe!"
333017,31750,2009-04-18,5,"I have made something similar to these for years, but instead of butter, I was using oil.  I loved my version....but, I think I would like your version better!"
447123,31750,2009-07-04,5,Wow can't believe I forgot to review this recipe!!!!! Well it really is absolutley AMAZING!! very yummy melt in your mouth taste. I did add 1 tep of vanilla and it just sent it over the top. Dont be afraid to add blueberries or banannas or anything you want!!!
140806,31750,2009-10-29,5,Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. We were going to make extra to throw in the freezer but we ate them instead. It tastes great with vanilla too.
176615,31750,2010-03-21,5,"Fantastic waffles! Buttery and light, crispy on the outside. The family ate them with warm maple syrup as fast as I could make them. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1269015,31750,2010-07-31,4,"I subbed the eggs with 1 Tbs flax seed each. They took a long time to cook relative to other waffles I've made -- coming out more of a pale yellow-cream than that nice golden-brown, but they tasted really great. Very buttery, we actually really liked them with a topping of preserves better than the usual butter syrup."
839492,31750,2015-01-06,2,"The butter content is too high for the ratio of dry ingredients making for a very thin batter and a rubbery waffle. I think if you halve the amount of butter (and even replace with canola oil), it would probably be an outstanding waffle. The flavor was good, just the texture wasn&#039;t what we&#039;d hoped it&#039;d be."
265954,31750,2015-08-12,3,"I followed this recipe exactly and, while the waffles were good, they weren&#039;t fluffy at all. I thought that maybe it was something I had done wrong until I read how many other reviewers had the same problem. I will say the taste was really good--I did add vanilla and cinnamon. My daughters thought these waffles tasted like regular pancakes. The measurements in this recipe seem off--it calls for a lot of baking powder, a lot of butter, and the flour-to-milk ratio also seems off, resulting in a very thin batter.  In any event, these flat waffles tasted good with the addition of vanilla and cinnamon, and they were gobbled up in our home. Thank you for posting."
2549237,31750,2016-12-12,5,"These are most definitely The Best Waffles I have ever made. I have made them several times and they always turn out crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Tonight, I made these as &quot;Brinner&quot; (Breakfast for Dinner) and I subbed in buttermilk because I needed to use some up and they still turned out magnificently. Thank you for a great waffle recipe Cooking Creation."
1581225,31750,2017-02-13,5,"These were great waffles. I have a new top of the range waffle maker and this recipe worked well with it. I do find the recipe that came with the machine a bit easier, as it didn't involve beating the egg whites. I know that step made them lighter and fluffier on the inside, but I'd prefer quicker and easier early in the morning. I'm still giving it five stars though because I still think the fluffiness is worth the extra effort if that's important to you."
51011,46501,2003-01-22,5,Oh my gosh! Anyone with fears about making bread totaly needs to try this recipe! I will never buy store bought french bread again! I made the dough in my bread maker and then followed diggy's tip about cooking it in the oven.  Thank you so much for posting this! It is soooooo good!
8688,46501,2003-04-01,5,"I concur with all the other reviewers!  This bread is fabulous!  Excellent texture and flavor for a French Bread! I baked as directed, but next time, I will follow Diggy's excellent instructions!  Thank you Ricky, for posting this on Zaar for all of us to enjoy!"
39835,46501,2003-04-08,5,Wonderful bread! I made it as directed in the recipe but next time I will make it the way Diggy suggested. By the way rickv what is a bow knife?
47907,46501,2005-04-18,5,I tried this over the weekend and was very happy with the results.  I baked in the bread machine because of time and it worked wonderfully.  Next time I use dough cycle and bake on a stone.  Thanks for posting!
147109,46501,2005-04-29,5,"All I can say is wow!  I don't think I will be buying French bread again!  I originally tried this in the bread machine and was very pleased with the results, but it wasn't any more note worthy than some other basic recipes I have for my bread machine.  Then last night I tried the recipe using Miss Diggy's suggestions and I would give it off the chart stars!!  My DH was drooling!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!"
29782,46501,2005-05-17,5,While reviewing the reviews this morning I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did too. It is GREAT! I made mine on the dough cycle and put in a greased pan and let rise and than added  melted butter over top and baked in oven. LOve the texture and how easy it was to make. THanks for sharing your recipe!!!
47559,46501,2005-08-01,5,"Add another 5 stars to this fabulous recipe.  It has everything going for it.  A minimal number of ingredients, practically no effort (in the bread machine), and fabulous texture and taste.  A winner all around."
53932,46501,2005-11-14,5,"Great bread!  I completed the entire process in the bread machine and to my surprise, it really was good.  Next time I will try baking it in the oven as suggested by Miss Diggy."
37305,46501,2005-11-21,5,"This is incredible bread!  Not only is this the best French bread I ever baked, it's also the best French bread I ever ate!  I used the dough cycle on my machine and took it out after rising.  I then shaped into two loaves and sliced slits in the tops.  I let it rise until doubled and then baked in the oven at 425* for 20 minutes.  I placed a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven to get that classic French bread crispy crust.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!"
169969,46501,2005-11-21,5,I agree with all the reviewers - this bread is simply awesome! I used the dough cycle and then rolled it into two small loaves and baked it in the oven. Super easy and Super tasty!
9869,46501,2006-01-05,5,"What lovely bread! I followed Miss Diggys instructions as well and it turned out perfectly, smells pretty darn good too.  Thanks for sharing. "
52125,46501,2006-01-21,5,Let me add another 5 stars to this recipe.  This is a really great recipe and taste wonderful. This is a keeper. Thanks rickv....
55578,46501,2006-03-06,5,Great bread!!(Like you didn't already know!!)DS says it's the best bread I ever made!
173579,46501,2006-11-17,5,This was very good bread.  Thanks for posting.
394077,46501,2007-01-10,3,"Crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside.  I don't have a bread machine so I made them by hand. After the dough rose the first time,  I punched it down, formed into 2 rolls and let them rised slowly for about 1 hour.  I then sprayed them with water and baked them at 375 for 25 minutes.  Thank you for the recipe."
255338,46501,2007-01-10,5,"On a whim, I decided to try out this recipe because of its lack of sugar and oil, and because of the wonderful reviews it had gotten. Not having a bread machine either, I just mixed everything up in my KA, let it rise twice and baked it as per other reviewers' suggestion, and my reward was a delicious french bread as french breads should be. Thank you so much for this recipe, it will be made over and over again."
377581,46501,2007-01-31,4,"This bread is good. It has a crisp outside crust with a tender inside. The flavor is plain and would be good for soaking up soups or sauces. I subbed one cup of whole wheat flour, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. Excellent that is so simple to make. Thank you!"
173314,46501,2007-08-20,5,This was delicious!  I used bread machine for dough cycle and finished in oven at 375 degrees for 35 minutes.  I took it out and brushed with some softened butter.  Loved it!  may make mini rolls and use for subs one night. thanks again!
402559,46501,2007-08-30,5,"Used the dough cycle as well, after baking I brushed #218888 Olive Oil and Parmesan Garlic Bread ""low Fat"" over the top and in the cracks and baked for another 10 minutes, it was superb and I will be making this often. Thanks!"
461834,46501,2007-11-25,5,"I made this in my bread maker on the dough setting.  I then took it out and kneaded it for a few minutes and then pressed it into a rectangle and then rolled it up, let it rise again and then baked.  This made a beautiful french bread and tasted wonderful also!!!  I wish I would have taken a picture of the loaf, hopefully next time!!"
632249,46501,2008-01-20,5,"Great bread but boy am I glad that you cannot see how funny my loaf looked. I decided to bake in the oven because I don't like the shape of the loaf that my bread machine makes. Well, how ironic but apparently my machine shapes a loaf better than I can. I am new to this bread making and even though the Zaar recipes taste great, my buns and loaves tend to look a bit odd.  I even followed Diggys instructions below, but still managed to goof it up.  Not to worry, I will master this some day. Thx for the yummy recipe."
132383,46501,2008-04-06,5,My husband and I cannot keep our hands off this bread.....we followed Miss Diggy's instructions for making a loaf....WOW.  Thanks for posting!!!!
40961,46501,2008-06-07,5,5 Stars for an easy to prepare bread with excellent results. Delicious and a wonderful crust with a tasty soft inside. thanks for sharing:)
240552,46501,2008-07-20,5,Wonderful large loaf of French bread! I mixed and kneaded with my KitchenAid mixer and then let rise for 1st rise overnight in fridge.  Then I shaped into loaf in the morning and let sit for a couple hours until rose for 2nd time.  I used this with recipe #274631 for breakfast this morning.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
439797,46501,2008-11-28,5,I cut the recipe in half and it was great.
218535,46501,2008-12-09,5,great recipe. I followed the recipe as is.
126440,46501,2008-12-22,5,"I have made this many times but most recently for Recipe #33752.  DH loves bread and it is the best!  Very easy using the bm.  I rolled it out, let is rise, brushed egg white on it and baked at 350 deg. for 35 min. Delicious!"
470351,46501,2009-03-14,5,This was FABULOUS!  My husband wanted to make french toast for the kids this morning but we didn't have the right kind of bread in the house.  I went in search of a bread machine recipe that could cook in the machine during the night and came across this one.  I baked this on in my machine and set the timer to be ready for 6:30 this morning.  FABULOUS!  I almost hated to waste this on french toast but it made a great french toast AND the bread alone was perfect!  Why buy it in the store when it could be made so incredibly at home?  THANK YOU!!
140132,46501,2009-03-24,5,Very good bread recipe.  DH came home from work and his mouth started watering as soon as he shut the door....lol.  I love how easy this recipe was and the taste was fabulous.  Thank you for posting.
324621,46501,2009-07-20,1,"Total flop on the quick-bake cycle. Didn't rise at all and baked in one big lump. Extremely crusty on the outside, dense and chewy on the inside. Bummer."
184723,46501,2009-08-31,5,"Seriously, this was the BEST BREAD ever!!!!!  My whole family devoured the first loaf I made, then I made another when we had company over for dinner the next night.  My son begged for it tonight with dinner so here I am pulling up the recipe once again!  I followed Miss Diggy's advice and this couldn't be any better.  DELICIOUS.
Thanks for posting!!!!!"
637486,46501,2010-08-02,5,This is one of the best breads I have made with the bread machine so far!  I loved how it didn't have any oil or sugar in the mix.  I served this alongside a salad for dinner and it was delicious!  Thanks for posting.
789516,46501,2012-02-16,5,"This made a great, basic loaf of bread!  I used 3 cups whole wheat, 1 cup white flour.  I set my bread maker to whole wheat - light setting and removed it about 15 minutes before the timer.  Perfect for sandwiches.  Update:  I made this today with 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour.. what a difference from my first attempts at this bread!  With 3 cups of whole wheat, the bread alway sunk, what a difference with the extra cup of white flour.  Also I set my bread machine on medium crust."
13796,46501,2013-11-06,5,They say that bread making is a science...   and I can tell you now that just THAT little bit of flour or salt... or NO oil.. makes a huge difference. I&#039;ve been experimenting for a while now with different bread recipes and you&#039;d think that just a 1/4 cup of this or a 1/4 tsp. of that wouldn&#039;t change it much... well... let me tell you..   it is a difference of great proportions in taste. This is THE recipe ........  I made 3 different recipes today (for the football playoff game) (each has been reviewed here previously) and hands down.. this is the winner. I didn&#039;t bake this in the machine.. I split it into two long loaves and baked at 400&deg; for about 25 minutes (I sprayed the oven with a spritz of water when I put them in).. Thanks for a taste that we&#039;ve been searching for. I think I need to bake it a bit longer for a crispier crust. YUM.. :-)&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE: 11/06/13 This is still a terrific recipe. I&#039;ve replace one cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of white bread flour and added a little Vital Wheat Gluten. I made two baguettes and they turned out beautifully.
136997,100526,2005-12-03,5,"I have to agree with all the other reviews, wonderful taste and so very easy to put together. :)"
50969,100526,2006-01-18,5," let me say my first mistake was,that i only made half. i wished i had made the whole recipe.it was just the right taste i was hoping for.now,i won't have to go to KFC for cole slaw.thank you for posting. — Jul 21, 2005, 1 member found this helpful.UPDATE:i've made this several times since i posted my first review of this back in July 2005 and just gets better each time i make it.to make it quicker i've started to use a bagged cole slaw mix,and i also cut back the mayo to 3/4's of a cup.but otherwise i've kept to the original recipe.thanks again for posting.
"
191533,100526,2006-04-27,5,FINALLY- after 3 tries with cole slaw I find one that we like! This is your average slaw; very basic recipe. But I like it because it's simple and tastes just right! I use soy mayonnaise.
402559,100526,2007-02-23,5,"I added a small can of crushed pineapple and served this with my Caribbean meal, delicious! Thanks."
8629,100526,2007-03-24,5,This is just how we like our coleslaw.  I appreciate the tip that the dressing amounts can be adjusted but to keep the ratio of vinegar to sugar at 1:1.
92816,100526,2007-04-14,5,"This is a very nice tasty coleslaw.I used the bag coleslaw mix and it made enough for 1/2 the bag,depending on how creamy you want your coleslaw.I also added 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice and a little bit of pepper.Thanks for posting."
29782,100526,2007-05-16,5,"WOW! I have to say that this was the best coleslaw I have had in ages. I cheated and used store already shredded cabbage. I used half the bag and only used 1Tbs of white vinegar (I don't like vinegar that much)I also added a couple shakes of celery seeds. It was a sweet creamy slaw and one I know I will make again :)
Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!"
60989,100526,2007-05-29,5,"Awesome. I couldn't believe that something so simple and easy could be so darn good. My husband, who claims to not like coleslaw, had two helpings! Thanks!"
350750,100526,2007-06-20,5,This is great! I've made this 3 times now and it always turns out to be great!  I'll keep this simple and tasty recipe handy.
27643,100526,2007-07-03,5,"Excellent! I made as directed, very easy. Crisp and tangy. Will definitely make again. Thanks Marg!"
439797,100526,2008-02-08,5,delicious!
126104,100526,2008-02-09,2,"I used the bagged slaw and followed the recipe exactly.  It was quite bland for me.  I added celery seeds later, and it's still bland.  Sorry, Marg.  I had really hoped this would be one I liked.

Maybe I just need a little more vinegar."
140132,100526,2008-04-02,5,"Perfection, I made this for hubby to take on work trip.  He said the guys thought it was great.thank you....Stephanie"
248023,100526,2008-04-27,5,"Simple slaw to throw together with really great flavor...  I was tempted to add in more vinegar, but refrained until I had tasted the slaw after it had chilled for a few hours.  I am glad I waited.  It was PERFECT!  We topped off some pulled chicken sandwiches with this delicious slaw and my BF even had some as a side.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!"
368078,100526,2008-05-20,5,"yumm, yumm, yumm!!! We used the bag of slaw mix instead of shredding the cabbage ourselves, but other than this didn't change a thing. We made this recipe to eat with ""My Family's Favorite Sloppy Joes Recipe"" #63689. We kept snacking on it before the sloppy joes were even done - it was that good! Thanks for a great recipe we will make often!  Update - we have made using a bag of broccoli slaw instead of slaw mix.  That was very good as well!"
218535,100526,2008-08-01,5,Just the right mix of ingredients. It's my default coleslaw recipe.
131021,100526,2009-03-13,4,I really liked this. We had it on pulled pork sandwiches and it was a great compliment. I might like to add a little onion and celery seed. I used half the mayo but kept the vinegar and sugar the same.
242484,100526,2009-03-31,5,"I have made this a few times already and it is now my turn to recipe for coleslaw! Perfect balance of sweet, tart & creamy!"
81611,100526,2009-05-30,5,"You can't buy deli coleslaw again after preparing and eating this! It is too easy and too good, and of course open to interpretation and experimentation. My kids ate it without complaining; one had seconds. The entire bag of premade slaw was gone, just w/2 adults and 4 small kids!"
55729,100526,2011-03-27,4,"This turned out well. I used 4 carrots. Used the food processor to shred everything. My husband came behind me and added some cider vinegar, so I don't know how it would have tasted in it's original form. Maybe next time I will just use the cider vinegar alone. There is nothing fancy about this - it is just simple and easy (and inexpensive)."
620763,100526,2011-07-06,5,"I loved this coleslaw, it's so easy to make and tastes delicious. I used a bag coleslaw mix to make it super easy. I added a little salt and pepper."
52543,89207,2005-03-08,5,Using 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa resulted in a mild milk chocolate flavour that was perfect on your Deep Dark & Delicious Chocolate Layer Cake! It was a hit at a birthday lunch for a fellow Zaar Chef. Thanx Kitten!
146047,89207,2005-05-24,5,"Quite frankly, I'm flabbergasted that I actually made this delicious frosting myself. What a great recipe. Foolproof. I went with 6 T dutched cocoa powder, and I lightened the calorie load just a smidge by Splenda for baking (1 c) and nonfat dry milk (1/3 c) for a chunk of the powdered sugar. I also used fat free half and half, and went with half butter, half non-hydrogenated shortening. This went together so quickly in my food processor! I now have a beautiful tub of glossy, smooth, thick frosting which will go perfectly with Graybert's Chocolate Zucchini Cake recipe #20658. Thanks for posting! -- posted Dec 28, 2004  UPDATED: I've now made this a second time and once again it's excellent. I forgot to mention last time that I added 1 T corn syrup in order to achieve a glossy finish. It's so smooth, rich, and creamy, even with fat free milk this time!"
8688,89207,2005-07-03,5,"Another winning recipe submitted by our gracious Kittencal!  This frosting is the perfect complement for my chocolate cake.  Easy and quick to prepare for a chef in a hurry ; )  Thanks again, Kitten!"
121185,89207,2006-03-04,5,I used 1/2 cup cocoa and fat free half n' half - this is sooooooooooooooo good - I planned on saving whatwe didn't use but everyone ended sneaking a fingerful here and there and then we had none to save!  Yum!!
52262,89207,2006-03-26,5,"What an easy, delicious chocolate icing!  I doubled the recipe and it was more than enough to ice a two-layer dark chocolate cake.  I went with the medium chocolate using 1/2 cup cocoa per batch.  I had a little confusion on step 2 so instead I put in all of the listed ingredients in the step except the cream.  Then I put in the cream a little bit at a time to be sure I didn't pass the desired consistency.  I ended up adding more cream to make the icing more spreadable on the cake.  Also, I used fat-free half and half since that was what I had in the house and it was perfect.  Why use the extra fat when you can't tell the difference? :)"
81611,89207,2006-08-25,5,"Most excellent. Made to go w/your cake mix brownies. Beautiful texture, great flavor, and easy. THE frosting recipe I have searched for!"
347822,89207,2006-11-02,4,"Frosting is pretty sweet.  I had to use 2/3 cup whipping cream.  1/3 cup was too little to add texture. Also, I suggest sifting the powdered sugar and the cocoa powder, otherwise its hard to get rid of the lumps (especially the powdered sugar since its white and its stands out).  I used 1/2 cup of cocoa because I used it to frost a chocolate cake. Overall, pretty good. "
131021,89207,2007-02-05,4,"I made this for cupcakes for my son's birthday party and I thought it was good, definately better than store bought but it didn't really wow me. I will try again when I have more time to really taste it. My niece actually made it for me and we used whipping cream and 1/2 cup cocoa powder."
128473,89207,2007-06-20,5,"This frosting is delicious, thick, light, rich, creamy and chocolaty. The perfect blend of chocolate, butter, cream and icing sugar. I made the medium version with half and half cream, wonderful just wonderful... Kudos Kitten for another winner, I can't wait to try the other versions, thanks for sharing."
91392,89207,2007-07-12,5,"Fast and easy and you really can get the degree of cocoa you want, I started lite, then added more. Easy to mix with an electric mixer and room temp butter."
294000,89207,2007-07-17,5,"Just get me a bowl of this and a spoon.
I used the 1/2 cup cocoa (medium) and skim milk with perfect results.
DH says it's more addictive than... well, he's a cop so he should know.
This recipe will be my ""go-to"" recipe from now on."
140132,89207,2007-08-15,5,"MMMMMM  I loved this frosting.  I made this to go along with #2496 Dark chocolate cake and it was wonderful.  I've never made a buttercream frosting before and I'm not sure why i waited so long. Delicious.  Thank you , this was great......Stephanie"
185285,89207,2007-08-21,5,"I actually used this frosting to go with Recipe#32204 for a company BBQ. Super easy frosting that can go with anything. Not too sweet, and just rich enough. Definately fail-safe if you're looking for a frosting that won't risk conflicting tastes."
176615,89207,2007-09-12,5,UMMM! Used the dark rich version and highly recommend it. Could have eaten the entire bowl with a spoon but managed to save some for the recipe #2496. Suggest sifting cocoa and powdered sugar together. Why buy the gross stuff in the can when this is so easy and uses ingredients you can pronounce? Made for DH's birthday and will use again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
142367,89207,2007-11-11,5,Excellent & easy -- thanks Kittencal!  I used this to frost a 13 X 9 cake and there was plenty of frosting. Thanks for sharing.
383346,89207,2008-01-24,5,"I did for dark rich.  I used unwhipped whipping cream cause I didn't have enough half-and-half.  I put this frosting on the cake recipe#262773   But since I did half the cake, I should have done half frosting.  I have leftovers in the fridge.  I guess I'll have to do another cake LOL  Thanks Kit :)  Made for Zaar Star Game."
264017,89207,2008-02-21,5,"This is perfect frosting in every way! I frosted my daughter's 18th birthday cake with this. I did need a double batch to completely cover the 2 layers. I sure didn't want to be blamed on skimping on this special cake! Try using this on Kittencal's ""Recipe #218794"" for your chocolate indulgence."
353131,89207,2008-03-02,5,What a wonderful frosting!! I made this to go on my daughter's birthday cake! It was easy and simply scrumptious!! Very creamy!
218535,89207,2008-03-05,5,This is a very good chocolate buttercream. Smooth enough to frost. I had enough to frost 18 cupcakes.
620763,89207,2008-03-15,5,So good!  I used 1/2 cup of cocoa and heavy whipping cream.  I can eat this by the spoonfuls!
55578,89207,2008-06-15,5,"Great recipe, just like my mom used to make!  I did the medium cocoa powder and it turned out perfect!"
146486,89207,2008-07-18,5,I doubled this for a three layer cake and it was awesome!  I used 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening in place of the butter but besides that didn't make any changes.  This will be my go to chocolate icing recipe from now on.  Thanks Kittencal!!
92816,89207,2008-08-26,5,"This is the best homemade icing I have ever used.I put all the ingredients into my food processor and it was done within a couple of minutes.I used 1/2 cup of cocoa and milk.It made enough to frost a large tube-pan cake.
I made this again for a baby shower.I doubled the recipe and it was enough to frost a double layer rectangular cake.It was perfect!"
666723,89207,2008-09-11,2,"What did I do wrong?  I'm not sure!  I measured everything exactly and followed directions to a T!  Mine came out runny... too runny to frost cupcakes!  I had to add more powdered sugar just to get it semi creamy.  I also had to let it sit in the fridge for 30 min before I frosted my cupcakes.  And I could only frost 12 at a time b/c they started to melt and drip down the side (didn't use much either!) After frosting 24 cupcakes, I have a TON of frosting left over.  The taste is great though, I just don't know how to fix the texture.  Sorry!"
312577,89207,2008-10-18,5,"Kitten,
Excellent recipe for frosting.  I knew I could count on you.  (I just made your fabulous french bread #256722 last night again for the 20th something time).  Thank you for another 10 star recipe!"
168462,89207,2008-10-23,5,Excellent icing. I had to make a cake today for the fun fair at my daughter school (for the cake walk).  This was so easy to make and spread beautifully. It wasn't too sweet either. Thanks for the recipe.
47559,89207,2008-11-23,5,"This is the best chocolate frosting I've ever made.  I used heavy whipping cream instead of the half and half, and 1/2 cup of cocoa powder.  It was wonderful.  Everyone at the birthday party raved about it.  Thanks for sharing with us!"
180090,89207,2008-12-19,5,"Very sweet yummy frosting! I first made it with 1/2 cup cocoa but added more because I thought it tasted a lot better with more, more chocolately and it toned down the sweetness of the powdered sugar a little. I used a hand mixer, but next time I'll use my Kitchenaide stand mixer to see if it is easier. Also I used nonfat milk, but would like to try to use half n halfcream next time. Thank you for the recipe Kittencal!"
172369,89207,2009-03-06,5,"Thanks for another great recipe kitten. I could not find my vanilla and I know its here, so I used Kahlua instead and it was fantastic. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
74281,89207,2009-04-03,5,This recipe is very easy and delicious. I made it for Recipe #2496 and it really complimented the cake perfectly. I made the medium version and as suggested by Kittencal did need to add a bit more cream to get the right spreadable consistency.
1122161,89207,2009-04-26,5,"This frosting was really light and creamy. I used this to frost the side of my German chocolate cake. I used the lightest version, and will definatly be using this recipe again! Thanks!"
324621,89207,2009-04-27,5,Yummy! Worked out great to frost cupcakes for my hubby's birthday!
520150,89207,2009-06-03,5,"Wonderful!  I used this to make a teddy bear cake for a baby shower.  Used a basting brush to dab at the frosting & it looked just like fur - so cute!  This is & will always be my go-to chocolate frosting recipe.  Thank you so, so much Kitten!"
329638,89207,2009-06-08,5,"How had I not tried this before?  Made a perfect icing for Easy Chocolate Snack Cake X Two
Recipe #326961.   We enjoyed the leftovers straight out of the bowl too :)   My new chocolate icing recipe...can't wait to try it with the coolwhip!  Thanks Kittencal!"
92886,89207,2009-07-15,5,"So easy to make. A wonderful consistency to ice your cake with, not too thick not too thin, just exactly what I needed!  I kept it at room temp and did not  have a problem with melting, but my office is pretty darn cold!  I think this will be my go to buttercream recipe now."
529278,89207,2009-07-25,0,"I was planning on making this to top Kittencal's Extreme Chocolate Brownies but had a question first.  When looking at the ingredients, it seems to me that this needs refrigeration, but I don't really think cold brownies sound good.  I was wondering what other people did.  I don't want to make everyone sick."
140806,89207,2009-08-15,5,"This recipe threw me off a little bit. I only had 1% milk so the amount of confectioner's sugar I needed to use almost doubled! As other reviewers suggested, I whipped this up in the food processor, which I probably won't do again. It made it more difficult to get a feel for the consistency I wanted. Despite that, this is a beautiful, glossy and creamy frosting. I opted to go for a medium richness, which is delicious! My little trick is to add a small pinch of salt to bring out the flavor. Thanks, Kittencal!"
318235,89207,2009-08-24,5,Delicious! Made the medium richness and will next time go for the dark rich. I made a double batch and needed to add about 3 more tablespoons of butter because mine had too much of a powdered sugary taste at first. I had planned to make more and freeze but I had a cake disaster and so I needed lots of extra frosting to try and make it look presentable... I think we ended up with more cake than frosting but thats another story...:?
59163,89207,2009-09-09,5,"Very similar to what I've been making for years, a devilshly good frosting.  Sifting the powdered sugar is the secret to it."
8629,89207,2010-01-24,5,Just wanted to add another 5-star review for this recipe. I made the medium flavored version for recipe #264752. I also took the advice of another chef and added 1 T. corn syrup in order to achieve a glossy finish. The frosting was so soft and creamy. Really delicious.
142559,89207,2010-02-07,5,FANFLIPPINGTASTIC!!! This is oodles of noodles better than that canned frosting! And so easy to make! I doubled the recipe and added a little espresso powder to it and it came out so good!! I even caught my friend eating it straight from the bowl! Thanks for making me look so good!! :)
58836,89207,2010-02-14,5,Made this last week to frost recipe 11799 and it was delicious.  Took to board meeting and leftovers were put in lounge next day.  I had lots of requests for the recipe.  I'm sure I will make this one again...Thankd Kitten!
879716,89207,2010-03-21,5,Wow!  I used the minimum amt of cocoa and a touch of almond extract (I was out of vanilla) and the frosting tastes like milk chocolate ice cream.  Yummy.  I also used less sugar since my cupcakes were already on the sweet side.
362983,89207,2010-05-11,5,"This frosting is wonderful! I used 1/2 cup of cocoa and it was so delicious and chocolatey. I used this to frost the Dark Chocolate Cake (2496) and everyone loved it! I had just run out of vanilla extract, so I subbed rum extract and it was delicious! Very easy to make and worth the extra calories! ;) Thanks!"
1133190,89207,2010-08-27,0,"Update -  I recently made this with a mixture of half and half and milk, and used 3/4 c. cocoa.  Very good!  I also added a bit of salt, like 1/8 tsp and would highly recommend it (you probably don't need to if you use salted butter but I used unsalted).  I made this with 1% milk and 1/2 c. coco.  I think I""ll try 3/4 c. next time for fun.  Perfect! Thanks!"
789516,89207,2010-12-11,5,Halved the recipe for 12 cupcakes and used 1/3 cup cocoa.  Very nice and easy icing!  Thanks again!
1179225,89207,2011-09-09,5,"Fantstic! So smooth and rich, just loved it. I used milk and 3/4 cup of cocoa. I can't imagine it turning out any better made with cream, but I'll try it next time just to be sure. Thanks so much for posting this perfect chocolate frosting recipe!"
485151,89207,2011-04-06,5,Best chocolate frosting recipe ever! Replacing my old stand-by recipe from the back of the hershey's cocoa can. I used this on a chocolate cake I made for a friend's birthday and it disappeared fast. Even my son who isn't a fan of tons of chocolate ate a piece & went back for more!
198154,89207,2015-06-14,4,"When trying this frosting right out of the bowl, we weren&#039;t crazy about the flavor. But when we tried it on some scraps I had trimmed off the cake, we all liked it.  I had to make it twice to have enough for a 2 layer 9inch round cake.  Which worked out well, because the first time the texture was way too soft. So the second time as I was mixing I left out the cream. Instead I alternated between adding powdered sugar and the soft frosting of my original batch.  Still not the perfect texture for piping, but useable. Lucky for me it was for my own family and not someone else, so it was fine."
1581225,89207,2017-02-05,5,"Beautiful frosting! Makes a good amount for up to 24 cupcakes. I used it for only 12 but I piled it on and ate some myself, hehe."
174991,26210,2008-10-09,5,Very tasty and they come together quickly.  Nice and crispy.
383346,98415,2011-03-31,5,Great taste and texture. Thanks x0xMandYx0x :)  Made for cookbook tag game
140132,106627,2009-02-22,4,This is a good squash recipe.....thank you for posting.
39835,53198,2003-03-07,5,"Superb! The salmon was delicious--even my ds that doesn't like fish ate every last bit of his piece. One change to the recipe I made was I used ground mustard (1 tsp) instead of prepared mustard, because I was out of wet mustard and the second change I made to the recipe was cooking the fish at 425-degrees so I could cook potatoes in the oven with the fish--ofcourse we also had to cook the fish for close to an hour (our fish was 3-inches thick). Thanks SueJ for posting this keeper recipe."
55578,53198,2003-04-05,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe. It was fancy, but easy.  I didn't believe the salmon was cooked at the given time, and cooked it longer, shouldn't have!! I added the cheese at the end and thought it added a lot.  Excellent!"
37636,53198,2003-08-06,4,The sauce gave the fish a nice creamy flavor without too much dill or mustard imparted. Very simple to make and quick to finish. Thanks for the recipe!
222564,53198,2006-08-16,5,"Really good salmon, the sour cream sauce on top is not overpowering the subtle flavor of salmon at all, but bringing it out to the best. I did reduce the cheddar to 2 tbs, same amount as parmesan, and that was enough cheese, we thought."
55729,53198,2006-10-25,5,"Absolutely wonderful, and so easy! I will definitely make this again. (I have one fish-hater, and unfortunately this didn't change his mind, but the rest of us loved it.)"
312577,53198,2006-12-02,5,"Yesterday I printed this recipe out for the future and it so happened that my bf brought home a big piece of salmon from Costco.  So I cooked it right up using this great recipe.  Great way to eat salmon. I followed the cooking time and my salmon came out moist and delicious.  I omitted the cheddar cheese on top, but did add the parm. cheese."
362983,53198,2006-12-05,5,Mmm I loved this recipe! I used yogurt and I even left out the dill (I just used parsley) and left out the cheeses and it was still so good! The salmon was perfectly done and the flavours were just wonderful. Definitely making this again!
280271,53198,2007-02-03,4,"DH and I both loved this salmon dish. I did use all low fat. Yogurt instead of the sour cream, with lowfat mayo and cheese. Came out great. It did come out moist. We thought that with all the added ingredients it took away a little of the salmon flavor. But over all a great dish. I plan to make again for something different. Thanks, Paja for posting."
46660,53198,2007-02-15,5,"Outstanding!  Another salmon recipe that has proven to me that salmon doesn't have to taste gross and fishy!  I made this with lowfat ingredients and omitted the cheddar/broiling part.  I also mixed the parmesan right into the sauce.  I used tarragon instead of dill (personal preference).  My husband told me that if I made him choose only 10 things to eat for dinner ever again, this would be one of them!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
168462,53198,2007-02-28,5,Weloved this. Easy and lots of flavour. Definetely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.
173579,53198,2007-03-03,4,We thought these were really good. Nice topping.  Thanks for posting.
482376,53198,2011-11-04,4,This is a great way to prepare salmon. We enjoyed the flavor and loved that the salmon stayed moist. Thank you!
81611,53198,2007-09-14,2,"Forgot to add the salt & pepper. The topping didn't seem to penetrate much, leaving the fish dry."
331557,53198,2007-11-05,4,This is a good way to prepare salmon.  I did not add the cheddar cheese either as I did not think it was necessary.  I agree that the sauce does overpower the fish but with the amount of salmon we eat it is nice to have something different.  Thanks for posting!
53932,53198,2007-11-25,5,Excellent.  I used yogurt and omitted the cheddar.  The topping is just wonderful and adds great flavor to the salmon.
248023,53198,2008-03-20,3,"We love salmon and trying different ways of preparing it...  I used 4 4oz filets and thought the amount of sauce this recipes makes was overkill for this much salmon, IMO.  We like to taste the fish itself and let the sauce enhance it.  The sauce was delicious... but just a little too rich for us.  I will make half the amount of sauce next time and spread on a thinner layer.  We didn't bother with the cheddar...  the fish was delicious without...  Thanks for sharing..."
227607,53198,2008-03-30,5,Very good!!! I did not have sour cream or yogurt so I just added a splash of lemon juice and a little extra mayo.  I did not use the cheddar but did use the parmesan then a few panko breadcrumbs and some paprika.  It turned out wonderful
76951,53198,2008-04-27,4,"Great recipe!  It was SO hard to deviate from our old standby recipe for salmon, but decided to go out on a limb and try something different.  Boy, am I glad we did.  The sour cream/dill sauce was wonderful.  I had a little extra and didn't want to overwhelm the salmon, so I didn't use all of it but did serve it on the side.  I will do the same next time.  Thanks for a great, quick recipe."
789516,53198,2008-05-15,5,It would be very hard for me to deviate from this recipe.  Perfect flavours.
184723,53198,2008-05-16,5,"We loved, loved, LOVED this salmon!!!!!  THANK YOU for posting this wonderful recipe!  My whole family gobbled it up.
The only thing I will do next time is use the lower fat ingredients."
218535,53198,2008-05-19,5,Delicious and easy. I didn't have dill weed and didn't use cheddar cheese either. But it is still very good.
8629,53198,2009-01-19,5,"I loved every flavor in this recipe.  The topping makes an excellent dill chip dip, too.  I just realized that I forgot the cheddar cheese at the end.  I'll do that next time.  This is a 5-star recipe."
355637,53198,2009-01-19,4,"Sometimes salmon can be a bit bland in my opinion, however this recipe was quite tasty."
199020,53198,2012-01-23,5,Delicious! We loved the sauce! We've never had salmon prepared anything like this before.
347822,53198,2010-01-09,5,"Very easy, simple and moist.  I used fresh salmon (w/ skin) and fresh dill (2 tsps). I baked it only 15 minutes - as for the cheese - I only sprinkled the parmesan - it was good, but the cheese is not really necessary because the sour cream mixture is nice and light with subtle but refreshing touch of dill. The moisture was amazing, easy to cut and the skin just slid off. Thank you for a easy and good recipe."
879716,53198,2010-01-31,5,"Loved this!  I didn't have any dill so I used a little bit of chopped fresh cilantro instead.  I did add the cheese on top but it really didn't need it.  If I add it next time I'll just bake it until it's gooey instead of broiling it into a crust.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it all through dinner.  Baked and served it on a bed of spinach moistened with a little bit of chicken broth and seasoned with salt, pepper, and onion powder.  The spinach really complemented the fish and the fillets were perfectly cooked."
140132,53198,2010-06-20,5,"I love salmon but DH and DD's do not.  Well, they are all out of town adn DS and I are left to ourselves.  So we made your recipe and were not dissappointed.  It was so delicious I was practically licking my plate clean.  I loved loved loved the mustard cream sauce on the fish.  I used fresh dill weed instead of the dry but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We can't wait for them to leave again....lol.....and we already know what we are making.  Thank  you so much for one of DS and my favorites."
1052873,53198,2011-04-23,3,Guess I don't like tartar sauce on my salmon. Seems like it made healthy food unhealthy. The people in my family that don't like fish liked it. 4 4oz filets frozen solid 25 minutes.
2041603,53198,2011-10-27,5,YUM!!! This was fantastic!
136997,53198,2014-04-26,5,"Very much enjoyed this dish. I used fresh dill, as I don&#039;t like the dried very much and shallot instead of the regular onion. Keeper for sure. :)"
126440,53198,2015-01-11,5,Loved how easy and such good flavors.
198154,53198,2016-09-04,4,We enjoyed this recipe. Not everyone in our family is a fish lover. The ingredients in the sauce is the main flavor that comes through instead of the fish. I served this with steamed broccoli and cheddar bacon bread that I got from the local farmer's market.
133174,136997,2006-06-20,5,"I normally cook with brown rice.  The brown rice has a nutty texture that is missing from white.  When I saw this recipe, I knew I needed to give it a try.  It has a nice combination of flavors that blends together very well.  I served this as a side to Pan Seared Moroccan Salmon recipe 158351."
27643,26210,2002-07-05,5,"These were really delicious!! I used new potatoes right out of the garden. Boy were they tasty! I used 1/2 cup parmesan, and let them get really crisp. Great flavor, easy to make, I'll do these again! Thanks, Tara!"
49304,26210,2003-09-04,5,"Great,easy, way to do red potatoes. Every one loved them no leftovers. I used olive oil. Browned them, Yum. Recipe is a KEEPER. Thank you Tara."
22015,26210,2003-12-04,5,Great - I too let mine get a bit browner than called for because I like the crispiness.  Great taste and easy to prepare.  A definite hit even with my picky eater.
8629,26210,2007-08-28,5,Simply delicious. The family loved it.
180090,26210,2007-02-20,5,"Great potatoes! I loved the mild, yummy flavor of these. I cut them pretty small and they baked up well in the recommended time. Next time I'll reduce the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup, since I found 1/3 cup to be a little too much. Thanks for the great recipe!!"
47907,26210,2007-02-28,5,I used to make a very similar recipe but I never added the Parmesan and we really liked that addition.  I think I will also add less oil next time as they were still a little oily for me ~ everyone else thought they were fine.  Great flavor and very easy to throw together.  Thanks for posting!
158086,26210,2007-08-21,5,Loved these potatoes....I cooked them at a higher oven temp so they would get nice and crispy on the outside but soft in the inside...turned out perfect...
184723,26210,2007-09-23,5,"These were really good!  I halved the recipe with perfect results.  My husband loved them and requested I make these again.  Next time I think I'll try with Olive Oil, though... would there be a big difference?  Thanks!"
666723,26210,2008-03-17,5,"I really wanted to try these out but didn't have any onion soup mix. I followed the rest of the recipe, but added dried, minced onions (a handful), and some italian seasonings and some red pepper flakes for heat. I really liked the parmesan on these potatoes and there were no leftovers. This was a great way to use up some of the last red potatoes I had.. yum!  ***Update*** I tried these again last night exactly as directed with the dry onion soup mix.  They sure were delicious!  Easy recipe to make again and again."
189616,26210,2008-04-10,5,"Great spuds! In the past I used to just use a recipe that was on the back of Lipton onion soup mix. The parmesan in this brings the recipe to the upper level. I agree with the previous posters, the amt. of oil was too much. Did use olive oil, and nuked the leftovers for my DH for breakfast along with scrambled eggs and toast."
203325,26210,2008-08-23,5,We have these potatoes often when we grill.  The whole family loves them.
218535,26210,2008-12-30,5,This is very good.
81611,26210,2009-04-08,4,"I enjoyed these. I used homemade onion mix; it was a great flavor. The potatoes stuck to the glass pan, but that was because I didn't stir enough, I guess. I enjoyed the crispy parts, and it was easy enough to whip up (though it takes time to cook). The instructions at first don't say to cover, but then say to uncover; I almost missed covering them for the first part of cooking, but I think it keeps them from drying out (?)."
357358,26210,2009-04-26,4,"Delicious and easy. These were a bit on the salty side but, what with using onion soup mix, that was to be expected. I baked these along side my chicken, uncovered for 20 minutes at 450Âº F, then 55 minutes at 400ÂºF and they were browned and a bit crispy - perfect for us. PS - If I had known how much grated cheese to use, this would have been a five star review. Thanks for sharing."
76951,26210,2009-09-27,5,Delicious and oh so easy.  Everyone in the family agreed on 5 stars.  I will definately be making these again!
140132,26210,2009-10-05,4,"I really liked these potatoes.  The onion soup mix adds so much flavor to the potatoes.  I baked them for the written time, then turned the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp them up.....so good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with me we loved it."
126440,26210,2009-12-17,5,Great side dish.  Used recipe #24952 for the dry onion mix and they turned out great. Served with Recipe #188049.
426903,26210,2010-01-17,5,"Very nice potato recipe, they turned out nice and soft. Thanks for posting"
470351,26210,2010-03-18,4,Very good!  I cut the EVOO to 1/4 cup and followed the rest as stated.  I used EVOO rather than vegetable oil.  I had to cook this WAY longer than stated and still didn't get this to my desired level of crispness.  Great flavor...but will definitely try again.
1122161,26210,2010-07-02,5,"Great recipe! I would use less oil next time though and just cook on a cookie sheet the whole time to get them crispy, but really nice idea and I'm so glad to have tried these! Thanks for posting!"
1506604,26210,2010-12-12,4,"Very nice. It took me another forty minutes for it to bake through but after the long wait it was delicious. I would recommend steaming the potatoes for about ten minutes first, I think that will allow it to bake quicker (Next time I will try it). I used the envelope mix as directed and it was a bit salty but not so much to complain about so maybe next time I'll add an extra potato or minus a little of the packet."
914720,26210,2011-03-12,5,"This was a huge hit at my house.  My son said ""This is good enough to put on Recipezaar"", and my husband is talking about how he's going to parade around the office with his leftovers on Monday.  I cut the oil to about 2-3 tablespoons, and baked uncovered for about 35 minutes at 350, then turned the slices, added (a lot) of shredded parmesan, and turned the oven up to about 425 for another 10-15 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing."
168462,26210,2011-09-30,5,So simple and so good. Even my 13 year old who really dislikes potatoes ate these and claimed they were excellent. Thanks for the recipe
50969,26210,2011-12-19,4,"This recipe was made on 12/18/11 for the "" Let's P-A-R-T-Y 2011 ""Event and most importantly mine and my SO's dinner.I only had about 1 1/2 lbs. of red potatoes on hand,but used the full amount of oil and onion soup mix. For the amount of cheese 1/3 cup was used along with a generous amount of black pepper.Both my SO and I found the taste went very well with the steaks we had.Thanks for posting a recipe that will be made again and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
133174,26210,2012-02-12,5,These are very good and they reheat nicely.  After they were uncovered the oven temperature was bumped up to about 425 degrees.  I used recipe #89857 for the onion soup.  I made half the recipe for the 2 of us and had enough leftovers that we enjoyed them warmed in the toaster oven for breakfast this morning.
369715,26210,2012-05-22,4,These were good and easy to make. Next time I would cut back on how many potatoes I use (I did follow the recipe exactly as written) because some potatoes had good flavor and others didn't have any at all. I cooked these on the grill for 50 minutes. We enjoyed them but wish each piece had more flavor.
653438,26210,2013-02-21,5,Made this up to go with recipe#194375#194375 and used recipe#89857#89857 for the lipton onion soup mix....this was delicious!  I will definately make this again DH ate most of them so there was no leftovers.  Defiinately a favorite and going into my Favorites of 2013.  Next time I might try to cut the oil back just a little.  Thank you for posting.
456858,26210,2013-02-26,4,These were good....I would make again.
198154,26210,2017-05-31,4,I used this homemade onion soup mix: http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-dry-onion-soup-mix-110331 My oven was at a higher temperature (400 degrees F) because that was the temp my main dish needed to cook at. Even at the higher temp. my potatoes were not quite done and required an additional 10-15 minutes bake time. But they turned out fine and the family liked them.
36944,34881,2002-08-02,5,"This was an easy recipe to put together and it has a delicious blend of flavors! I used regular cheese as that is what I had on hand. I served it with condiments of picante sauce and sour cream.  (I will probably add a bit more tomato suce next time, but that is just a personal preference.)  If my family is any indication I would plan on this serving 4-5 people, not the 6 indicated in the recipe.  I guess that's a statement about the recipe in itself!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
52543,34881,2004-02-27,5,"Quick, easy & delicious! I used 12 ounces of my home-made tomato sauce which is fairly spicy, whole wheat tortillas & a combo of cheddar & monterey jack cheeses - with salsa & sour cream on the side. Thanx Meow! "
95743,34881,2004-03-05,5,Better than our local Mexican restaurant!  That's Dh's verdict and mine as well.  Just terrific made with whole wheat tortillas.  I used Mexican style stewed  tomatoes and it's juice rather than the tomato sauce.  This is too good to serve 6 people.  Four diners will gobble it up in no time.
101823,34881,2004-08-14,5,"Very good comfort food.  In order to satisfy my carnivore hubby, I added some of the shredded chicken leftover from Tahiti's Chicken Tacos (recipe #94613).  Because of this addition, I also needed a bit more tomato sauce in order to keep the filling moist (and soften the tortillas as they baked).  The flavor of this dish perfectly fit the comfort level.  It wasn't too spicy, but had a nice subtle heat...it could easily be spiced up (addition of jalapenos or cayenne pepper to the bean mixture), for those times when you just feel like more heat.  :)  Good weeknight  or even casual entertaining fare.  "
68960,34881,2005-10-12,5,"Fabulous recipe - Being in Australia I found dried 'Black Turkey Beans' in my health food shop. To use these black beans in this recipe I followed ketchupqueen's advice ""You can soak beans overnight in cool water, or bring to a boil, boil for 20 minutes, turn off heat but leave the cover on, and soak for at least 2-4 hours. If you have hard water, you should add a tsp. of baking soda"". Other than that I followed the recipe exactally except to subsitute the fresh tomatoes and sauce for a tin of tomatoes. Thanks you meow! for introducing us to black beans and for posting a recipe that I will use often."
176615,34881,2007-01-29,5,"Excellent and very quick to fix. I made exactly as directed, and DH and I loved it! Precooking the sauce ingredients really helped the flavors come together quickly. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
280271,34881,2007-02-03,5,"Excellent dish! I made it as posted with the exception of adding in an extra can of tomato sauce, I used the hot mexican style by el pato to add some extra spice to the dish. I will be making again. Next time I plan to try using whole wheat tortillas to add even more fiber, maybe some jalapenos... This is a recipe that you can play around and be creative with. Thanks spatchcock for posting."
68884,34881,2007-02-20,4,"Perfect for a quick weeknight meal. DH loves meat, but I have been making meatless meals at least once a week - and we both really liked this one. I didn't have any cilantro and I used full-fat cheese; I think this recipe is easily adaptable to what you have on hand. We topped it with a little sour cream and served with baked chips & your Recipe #36401."
362983,34881,2007-03-08,5,Delicious! So simple and quick and so tasty. Some of my family/friends still can't wrap their head around the idea of using tortillas in a dish like this but they're always pleasantly surprised when they try it! Thank you!
236170,34881,2007-04-10,5,Simple and delicious! My DH was hesitant to try this once he found out there was no meat - but he decided he couldn't even tell the difference. He doesn't like tomatoes so I substituted 1 cup salsa and it turned out perfect.
187281,34881,2007-07-11,5,This is very good... it's one of the best mexican-style casserole that we have had.  I used a 13 by 9 inch pan and did two layers.  It helped keep the tortillas from getting too soggy and was much easier to serve this way.  I enjoyed the strong cumin and chili powder flavors.
160974,34881,2008-05-01,5,"I made in a smaller casserole dish and used a combo of wheat, corn, and flour tortillas (they all tasted the same when baked). I added some chopped broccoli into the simmering tomato juice (used 2 small cans V-8). I didn't bake for very long, since I wanted it more ""saucy."" This was nice and hearty tasting. Thanks Spatchcock, for posting.
Roxygirl"
810787,34881,2008-08-12,5,I've been holding off making this recipe for a while. I honestly thought it wouldn't be that good. I was WRONG. It was very tasty. Since I'm watching calories/points I used the low-carb tortillas (1 point each). It helped to lower the caloric/fat content. Super great recipe worth keeping.
355637,34881,2009-01-02,4,"I added some ground beef to this recipe, just to make it more intriguing to my hubby... he likes meat! Very tasty!"
125640,34881,2009-01-06,4,"Good casserole. I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, doubled the garlic, and added just a bit of cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp sugar (to cut the acidity of the tomatoes) all of which I would do again. Black olives would be good in this. Beef would also be good, but DH didn't even notice the lack of meat which is unusual for him with a meatless dish. Thanks for sharing."
844554,34881,2009-04-15,5,"You've got a winner here! When hubby says I really liked what you made last nite, let's have this again, you know it's good. I did use whole wheat tortillas (needed to use them up). I also added corn and salsa and used 2 layers of tortillas at a time. Will go in the keeper file. Thank you! UPDATE 4-14-09: Made this again and it was just as good. I used regular flour tortillas and I think I'll go back to the whole wheat tortillas. Better texture. I didn't have cilantro and used salsa instead of tomatoes. Yummy!!"
768828,34881,2009-06-27,5,"I really liked this, my dh not so much, however, I made it with whole wheat tortillas as that is what I had on hand.  I think he will also like it as much as I do when I make it with corn tortillas.
I also did not use cilantro as neither of us likes it.
Thanks for a great recipe."
377581,34881,2009-07-14,4,"This is a good everyday recipe. It was very easy to put together and tasted very good. I added pinto beans and pureed the tomatoes. I think next time I make this, I may try adding frozen corn. Thanks!!!"
222564,34881,2010-02-17,5,Love this!
146486,34881,2010-03-01,5,Well here's another 5 star review to add to the many!  This was really good and was even better as leftovers.  I used flour tortillas and omitted the green onion.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!
1269015,34881,2010-05-18,3,"This was really good, but it made all 3 of us sick! Too much cumin, I suspect, in conjunction with the beans and dairy... Definitely not a dish for sensitive stomachs. I might try making something similar with different spices, less beans and dairy, and more veggies, because we did like this...."
168462,34881,2010-08-03,5,This is fantastic. I used 1 tsp chili and 1/2 tsp of cumin and tostitos in place of the tortillas. We loved it. This is easy to make  too. Thanks for the recipe.
140132,34881,2010-11-06,5,"Thank you, we loved it.  Family didn't miss the meat at all (yeah)."
2041603,34881,2011-10-27,4,My husband really liked this but I prefer less onion. Not a fan of the crunchy stuff!
39301,34881,2012-12-16,5,Loved this!  I've been trying to go primarily vegetarian and so I especially love this because it works as an entree for me and a side dish (with salsa chicken or something similar) for my family.  Then the leftovers make for a tasty lunch the next day.  We all really enjoy this one. Thanks for posting!
937635,34881,2013-03-04,4,"Good but a little dry. Next time I would double the sauce (but not quite double the beans). Easy and quicky vegetarian dinner, thanks!"
191533,34881,2014-08-21,4,"Very good... modify the bean/sauce mixture until it tastes the way you want it. As is, I didn&#039;t think there was enough flavor. I added some salsa and also smoked paprika, more chili powder, and a Chipotle spice mix. This is the first tortilla casserole I&#039;ve made that holds its layers when cut- yet with the extra salsa I didn&#039;t think it was too dry, either."
60260,48760,2003-02-07,5,"YUM! Quick and easy is a real bonus too.  I cut the red pepper back to 1/2 tsp. (for the kids) and let my husband add more for himself later.  It had a nice bite but for the kids' taste I might put even a little less next time.  Even with the spice their reaction to the dish was good.  My husband loved it and wants it kept in the ""make often"" section.  Thanks for sharing!"
91392,48760,2003-10-02,5,"Made this last night, only change was to use rice noodles.  We loved it!  It was tasty, cheap, easy and super fast, once you got everything out on the counter, even faster with the rice noodles which don't need to cook.  It will be a keeper.  I made it with very good quality ground steak--just yummy!"
56087,4627,2003-03-10,5,"This recipe deserves more the 5 stars...absolutely delicious.  Only change I made was to add a can of niblets corn and I too, used two cans of Rotel tomatoes and omitted the whole tomotoes.  Thanks for a great recipe."
101034,4627,2003-12-17,5,"I made this soup tonight and followed the recipe to a T. It was wonderful. I wish I had made a double batch of it though, it was sooooo good. I had roasted a chicken the other night, so I made the broth from the chicken carcus and had plenty of leftover chicken for the soup. The blend of flavors in this soup were excellent. We ate like little porkers!!! Thanks Eddie for a great recipe."
47559,4627,2004-11-01,5,"I sure thought I'd already reviewed this fabulous recipe, but since I don't see it, will do so now.  What can I add that hasn't already been said?  It has great flavor and texture, and is filling enough for a main meal."
47907,4627,2004-11-09,5,"Wonderful soup!  As the other reviewer said, it is VERY similar to the Tortilla Soup served at Red Robin.  I made exactly as posted except I had to let it boil about 30 minutes after the addition of the corn tortillas.  The recipe makes ALOT of soup so it would be great for a potluck.  Thank you for posting ~ it's a keeper!"
42720,4627,2005-01-19,5,"This soup is excellent! I was very glad to read other reviews which stated it freezes well because this recipe makes about 4 quarts of soup.  I followed the recipe exactly. I stewed fresh chicken thighs and used the broth instead of canned broth.  BTW: 4 cans of broth @ 14.5oz per can comes to 7 1/4 cups of broth. I also used the Masa Harina instead of soft corn tortillas and my soup was not grainey or lumpy. I took a hint from another reviewer and mixed the masa with a cup of cooled broth then stirred it into the simmering soup.  Overall, I was very pleased with the taste and texture of this soup.  The picture submitted by @ngdarlen looked so tempting, I also served sliced avocado along with the cheese & crushed tortilla chips to garnish, and I'm very glad I did.  The avocado with this soup had a surprising and delicious taste contrast. My dh said when he came in the door the aroma of this soup reminded him of our favorite Mexican Restaurant.  I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks Eddie!!

173314,4627,2005-02-13,5,My other tortilla soup recipe is history!  Thank you for such a delicious recipe....we loved it.
103876,4627,2005-02-13,5,"This is indeed the real deal!  I have been looking for a great tortilla soup recipe for a while and this is definitely it.  It takes a little while to put together, but the results are well worth it.  Very rich and creamy with just the perfect seasoning.  Thanks for posting.  I will be making this again for sure."
177933,4627,2005-03-09,5,"Not that this recipe needs another review, but, it was just so wonderful!  I will treasure it forever!  I followed the directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I will add that just toasting cut up corn tortilla strips in the oven instead of crushed chips is much better & nice for presentation.  Also, you must add diced avacodo a garnish- just fabulous! "
140132,4627,2005-09-25,5,"This is a very delicious soup.  I have never tried any other recipes for tortilla soup and won't be trying any either. We all loved this recipe. It was so easy to prepare , and you gotta love that .  A big thank you from yet another satisfied chef..."
137911,4627,2005-11-10,5,"This was fantastic!  I agree that it's very similar to the restaurant totillia soups.  I followed it pretty much exactly, except I had to add dried minced onion (1 Tbs) in place of the 1 cup onion as I forgot to buy it at the market.  I'm so glad I found this recipe. I plan on making it for dinner for company at Christmas time and for the Lent soup suppers at church next year!  Pam"
95743,4627,2006-01-13,5,"I suppose the last thing this recipe needs is another long-winded review, so I'll keep this brief; AWESOME."
49304,4627,2006-10-29,5,"YUMMY, YUMMY, Delicious soup. I made the recipe just like it is stated, but, added more garlic powder. The 10 tortillas worked great for a nice thick soup. Eddie, thank you for posting this delicious Tortilla Soup!"
185285,4627,2006-12-04,5,"No.. really?  This is not a starter soup, but a fantastic meal!!!  I agree with you Eddie, THIS is the real deal. It's not brothy and tasteless.  This is great.  I did 2 versions - One using low fat ingredients (Cheese, Tortillas & LF Margarine) and both turned out spectacular.  Even better the next day when the flavors meld. I marinated my chicken in Recipe #102598 before popping it under the broiler. Total comfort food."
26512,4627,2006-12-07,5,"Absolutely fabulous. Have been meaning to try this for ages and wish I'd done it sooner. I used Hot taco seasoning, but we like it spicy, so I also added a bit of chipotle powder & cayenne. I sauteed the chicken in a large stock pot, then added the veggies. Chopped them VERY finely in the processor. Seemed to work out fine and less steps, IMO. Very thick, great flavor. Husband loved it, not an easy task. Will be making this many times in the future, thanks for posting."
294000,4627,2007-02-01,5,"This is my new, favorite soup of all time.  We were recently stranded without power (for 12 days!) during the midwest's disastrous ice storm.  A friend with electricity took us in and this recipe received rave reviews from both families!  It truly does taste like something you'd order at a great restaurant.  Thanks for making even an ice storm bearable."
359220,4627,2007-02-16,5,"Very tasty and perfect for a cold, cold night.  I did make a few changes such as:  used garlic salt and bold taco seasoning from Penzeys, added 2 cans broth and 1 can water (I ran out of broth)and cut down on the simmering time after the initial 20 min boil with tortillas added.  I added cheese, simmered a minute or two, then the milk, followed by another min or two simmer and then served.  Delish and hearty and fairly healthy too!  Served with cheesy corn bread for one great meal!!!"
222564,4627,2007-02-22,5,"This soup is awsome, I mean REALLY awsome! The flavor is simply fantastic! I happened to taste it before adding the milk and cheese, and it was already superb, so it can be had cheesy or not. We had it as written and used tortilla chips, sour cream and cilantro to garnish. Yummyyyy."
394077,4627,2007-04-22,5,Love this soup.  Followed pretty much exact to the recipe except used half/half instead of milk.  Also fried some tortilla chips to put on top.  The chopped cilantro and sour cream added something very special to this soup so  don't forget to use them.  So delish!!
125640,4627,2007-05-17,4,"Very tasty. I used 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper and grilled the chicken. The only change I made was to use fajita seasoning instead of taco cause that's what I had on hand. This makes a lot (filled my stock pot all the way to the top) so I would halve the recipe next time, but will make it again. Thanks for sharing."
158086,4627,2007-07-18,5,Waht an easy weeknight soup recipe....I added some corn to it but otherwise followed recipe...we really enjoyed it....
226863,4627,2007-09-20,5,"This soup deserves all the 5 star ratings!  It was delicious before adding the cheese and milk, so you could reduce the calories that way.  I used low sodium taco seasoning to make it healthier, and used 2% cheese and fat-free half and half to lower the calories.  The recipe was still delicious.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it over and over again!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!"
231054,4627,2007-10-04,4,"We enjoyed this soup very, very much.  I followed your directions -- changing nothing.  I would have given it 5 stars but didn't because I had to wonder if I was using the right size cans.  Chicken broth comes in a couple different sized cans -- the same with diced tomatoes.  As far as I know the Rotel only comes in one can size.  It might be good if you edited the recipe to make those ingredients a little clearer.  I added all the garnishes -- and used fat free half & half in place of the milk.  We look forward to having this many times in the future."
229524,4627,2007-10-20,5,You certainly called it when you said this was the real McCoy.  It doesn't get any better than this.  My DH and I couldn't stop ooohing and ahhhhhing over the taste.  It is soooooooo good. I used chicken thighs and since they weren't cooked I cooked them in the oil and then added the onions and celery. Then followed the rest of the recipe as written. Served it with Best Cornbread Ever (18947).  Thanks Eddie so much for sharing such a fantastic recipe.
377581,4627,2007-12-03,5,Very Good! My family loves the taste and spice level of this. It was delicious and very easy to make! Thanks for posting - it's a keeper!
497077,4627,2007-12-26,5,"This soup is WONDERFUL! Followed recipe as written plus I added some frozen corn and garnished with chopped avocado, cilantro, and tortilla chips. Fast, easy, and delicious!!!"
13796,4627,2008-02-01,5,"Delicious! I more than doubled the recipe (I think)and used some black beans in my soup. I also added cilantro at the end. Simple, easy and delicious. I used about 5 quarts of chicken broth. There is no can size for the chicken broth in the recipe as stated at this time. No can size stated on the size of tomatoes at this time, either. Maybe the chef will change that soon?"
180090,4627,2008-02-09,5,This was very good! I followed the recipe exactly except I added the chicken later on with the milk so it wouldn't get dried out and over-cooked. I served with a dollop of sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Very easy to make and made a delicious light meal and great leftovers for lunch. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be making it again.
37779,4627,2008-02-12,5,Very flavorful soup. The texture was thicker and richer than I expected. Not brothy at all. I served with broken tortilla chips and shredded jack/cheddar blend on top. Made for a filling lunch. Thanks for posting the real McCoy.
229850,4627,2008-02-20,5,"This was totally awesome ! Never had any kind of Tortilla Soup before, just didn't appeal to me, so I thought LOL
Made it exactly as shown, but did follow the hint for the crock pot. I also did add heavy cream instead of milk. Thankyou for broadening my horizens !"
160974,4627,2008-10-11,5,"This was really excellent! The whole family loved. I used a rotisserie chicken and pureed two fresh tomatoes for the canned (I did use the diced with chilies as required). I went pretty light on the spices, but it still had a nice kick. I did toast the chopped tortillas in the skillet. I used shallots for the onions and did not have celery.

Roxygirl in Colo."
55578,4627,2008-10-23,5,What a great recipe!.  This has to be one of my most favorite recipes on zaar.
264017,4627,2008-11-09,5,"Well, let me be the 232nd reviewer to say this soup is SUPERB! From the very first step, the aromas were mouth-watering. The only change I made was to add a can of rinsed black beans and used 8 rather than 10 tortiillas. Topped each bowl with more cheese, sour cream and cilantro, we were full and delighted! Eddie, wherever you are, thanks so much for giving us this recipe!"
315055,4627,2009-02-12,2,"The consistency was horrible, I used whole wheat tortillas and it turned out to be a soggy tortilla mess...the flavor was okay but I couldn't get over the texture.  I'm not sure if using white tortillas would have made a difference, but I'm not going to try again."
126440,4627,2009-04-04,5,"I made half a recipe using one can of Rotel but no tomatoes, and masa for thickener. The flavor was great but next time I wouldn't use as much masa.  I used 1/2 c. masa and let it warm for about 30 min.  that could have been the problem.  I served with a quick cheese quesadilla."
176615,4627,2009-04-10,5,Really enjoyed this soup. Made as directed and it was perfect. My son also likes corn and black beans added which is a nice variation. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
198154,4627,2009-09-05,4,The rating for this varied from 3 stars to 5 stars by my family.  So we averaged a 4. The carrots were not as soft as I would have liked but the onions and celery were done.  I think that next time I will saute my carrots a little while before adding my other veggies.  We had never had tortilla soup before.  Thanks for giving us something different for dinner!
1179225,4627,2009-10-24,5,"We all loved this soup. I have made other tortilla soups and have always been disappointed. Not this time. I used masa and loved the flavor it added. I'm really looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks so much for posting your delicious recipe, I'll be making this again for sure."
145352,4627,2009-11-06,5,"Good...this makes a ton!!!! I mostly eyeballed the ingredients, but it was fairly close to as written. I loved it. And put the leftovers in the freezer!"
637486,4627,2009-11-29,5,"This was really good!  The only change that I made was that I grilled the chicken instead of poaching which is just a personal preference.  I used mild Rotel and it was still quite spicy.  I might try using velveeta next time as the shredded cheese gets lumpy when mixed in, but even with that, it had great flavor.  I will be making this throughout the winter!"
52262,4627,2009-12-05,5,"Everyone ate this soup, including my kids!  Yummy and easy to make! I used less oil (vegetable), low-sodium, nonfat broth, low-sodium tomatoes, 1 c. Masa four, skim milk, and crunched up tortilla chips on top when served.  I also added about 12 ounces of black beans I made.  My only confusion came from reading some of the reviews that didn't match up to the listed recipe.  My thought is that Recipezaar combined this recipe with another similar recipe and added the reviews from the other recipe here."
80998,4627,2009-12-29,5,A great recipe.  Super easy to make.  I made as stated except with no carrots.  I also used leftover turkey instead of chicken.  We topped with a drop of sour cream.  Very comforting when we were all sick.
132383,4627,2010-01-25,5,"I had high expectations for this recipe with all the reviews...and boy were my expectation exceeded.  Excellent soup.  I made it as directed, adding the optional diced tomatoes (used fire roasted).  Prep time is more than 10 minutes (it probably took me 30 minutes, including poaching the chicken).   This is a keeper!"
203325,4627,2010-03-27,5,"Not that this recipe needs one more review, but this is better than 5 stars!  I have been searching for a really good tortilla soup and this is it.  Even my husband, who does not typically like soup for dinner, ate it up."
847160,4627,2010-06-18,5,"wow , i didnt expect that to be that good ... thanks"
252816,4627,2010-09-23,5,"Today was one of those rainy, cool days,a perfect soup day..I had alot of fresh tomatoes from our garden so I peeled and diced them and added a can of green chiles in place of the rotel.I didnt read correctly about  saving 4 oz mexican cheese for topping,but added all to the soup pot...I always have leftover corn tortillas in the freezer from pervious meals so was glad I could use them all up...This soup was absolutely delicious..Wouldnt change a thing...I will be making this recipe often..Thank U for a great recipe....."
355637,4627,2010-09-30,5,Yum!!!!
1133190,4627,2010-10-08,5,"Really good!!  I boiled the chicken as directed from #4627 Shredded Chicken for Enchiladas, Tostadas, Tacos... and used the broth for part of my chicken broth!  Boiling the chicken then cooling it makes it easy to shred as well! I tasted the soup before I added the cheese and milk and I thought it tasted amazing even at that point.  If you wanted to save some time and make it a little healthier you could probably omit the cheese and milk and it would still be amazing.  Thanks!"
482376,4627,2010-11-05,5,"FABULOUS! Loved this recipe!! The flavor for an excellent chicken tortilla soup is ""spot on"" here. The only change I will make next time is to try omitting the cheese from the cooking process and just using it as a garnish. I thought the soup was already perfect before adding the cheese! Thanks for posting. :)"
8629,4627,2011-02-14,5,"I  have tried 3 times to get the 5 stars to show up on my review but it has not worked yet. If the 5 stars do not show up, please consider this another 5 star review. This is my first attempt at making chicken tortilla soup.  I made half a recipe and that filled up a 4 quart stock pot.  I didn't realize that the tortillas in chicken tortilla soup melt down and thicken the soup.  This soup has alot of flavor. I would be proud to serve this to guests.  I made this for the Best of 2010 tag game."
400420,4627,2011-03-07,0,"I'm not going to give any stars yet, because I wasn't able to follow the recipe.  Let me start by saying that we really liked the soup, but I'm not sure how close I came to how it should taste.  When I started cooking, I thought I had both a can of Rotel and a can of diced tomatoes, but when I went to add them to the soup, I had neither!  I subbed about 25 oz of crushed tomatoes and 3 tbsp of verde salsa.  Also, I had no carrots, and I think they woud definitely have added some good flavor.  I used bbq grilled chicken breast and a combo of sharp cheddar and jack.  I'll definitely make this again with the right ingredients and probably be adding another 5 star review.  Thanks!"
2041603,4627,2011-10-27,5,"Yum! We reduced the onion, omitted the celery and used vegetable oil. Very tasty soup with cheese and chips!"
59163,4627,2013-12-14,5,"The air is beginning to &quot;crisp,&quot; up and this was a wonderful soup for fall weather.  It has a great flavor and I loved the ease of putting it together.  I had never made a tortilla soup before, sorry I waited so long to try it.  Everyone I served it to really enjoyed it."
269331,4627,2014-03-29,5,I used a store bought rotisserie chicken for this dish and just added 8 tortillas.  The remaining 4 tortilla I cut into thin strips and fries in oil to make my own chips.  Don&#039;t forget to garnish with sour cream and avocado.  PERFECT!
2549237,4627,2016-10-17,4,"Followed this recipe exactly and my family was very happy tonight. I used the sour cream option, instead of milk in this. I like my soup really thick, so I did add about 12 corn tortillas. I served this with tortillas, green onions and sour cream. Thank you for a great soup Eddie!"
1581225,4627,2016-11-07,5,A very tasty soup. I had plenty left over to freeze and take to work.
29014,48760,2003-10-08,5,"This has such great flavor!  Fast & easy, too!  I had to reduce the red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon so it wouldn't be too spicy for Mark.  Also took the liberty of adding a can of sliced water chestnuts with great results.  Thanks, Sharon, this is a great weeknight keeper!"
101034,48760,2004-01-16,5,"Quick, easy and delicious. This was really good, we liked the different flavor it had and it's such a good way to use chop meat. It's a keeper here. Thanks Sharon"
42720,48760,2004-02-07,5,"WOW!! This recipe is great!  I also had to substitute Oyster Sauce for the Hoisin Sauce because it is all I had on hand.  No idea as to what extent this change made in the flavor, but you have a hit recipe, either way.  Absolutely delicious and I will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing!!
"
68960,48760,2004-06-27,5,"Quick, easy dinner with ingredients that I had on hand.  Exactly what I look for in a recipe.  I cooked the meat and sauce mixture in the morning and then that night heated some noodles on the stove and reheated the meat mixture.  I did omit the dried chilli as we have a 2yo and she's not a great chilli fan yet but then just sprinkled the flakes on top of the ones that like chilli.  Next time I'm at the butchers I will be buying some ground beef in bulk and cooking a large batch of this meat mixture to freeze for times when I need a quick easy meal.  Thanks Sharon for a keeper. "
9869,48760,2005-06-15,5,"This recipe was mentioned on one of the 'what's for dinner' threads and when I looked at it I knew it was going to be something my family would like.
It's one of those a little bit of meat goes a long way type recipes..not to mention the great flavours.
Quick and easy to put together.
Thanks for sharing."
4470,48760,2005-11-17,5,"Nice heat- spicy but not ""take your head off spicy""  I used fat noodles instead of vermicelle.. Lovely to have this tasty meal on the table in under 30 minutes.  Recipe made as posted except I used 1 tbsp Sesame oil.  I made the full recipe and have 3 servings ready for the freezer. I did not put the noodles in with the beef.  When I defrost one I will try it with the rice vermicelli  ThanksSharon123 - great recipe"
160974,48760,2006-01-03,5,"I've made this twice and the family loves it. The first time I didn't have fresh ginger and that makes a huge flavor difference. I use 1/4 hoisin sauce and that is enough for our tastes. Just as good with spaghetti noodles, too. We will make this regularly. Thanks, Sharon!

Roxygirl"
60992,48760,2006-01-19,5,"Very tasty! I used just three shakes of red pepper however and Dh thought it was too hot (wimp!). I used whole grain pasta (and only half the amount) to cut carbs and added about 1 1/2c. chopped cabbage in with the onions. I did add a little more soy and hoisin sauce than the recipe required. I thought it was great, and I will make it again!"
168462,48760,2006-01-22,5,"This was very simple to make. I only had ground pork on hand so I used that. Also I only had a little bit of hoisin sauce so I used oyster sauce instead. Everyone in our house loved this, even my daughter who does not like meat. I made this in the morning and it reheated well for supper. Thanks for the recipe."
136997,48760,2006-06-30,4,This was very good and I think it would taste even better if I remember to put in the ginger the next time. LOL!
174991,48760,2006-07-14,5,"This doesn't need another review, but here it goes.  I followed the recipe as stated and then add a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables.  great tasting and very easy.  "
218535,48760,2006-07-14,5,"Very yummy, although I found it a bit oily. I think I'll reduce the sesame oil to 1 tablespoon next time."
203325,48760,2006-07-17,4,This was a really simple dish to make.  The heat was just right.  I found it a little dry so I added a little soy sauce at the table.
169969,48760,2006-08-10,5,"Delicious! This recipe is perfect for busy weeknight chefs or chefs on a budget! It is quick to put together and is really delicious. It is one of those recipes that  further your meat without sacrifice to the flavor - nor does it leave you feeling that it is a budget meal. This will be made again and again in our household. The Asian spices and condiments are a wonderful addition to the ground meat and noodles... who would have thought?! I did not have cornstarch so I subbed a Tablespoon of flour and this worked well and did not interfere with the taste of the recipe. The heat was perfect for us at 1 1/2 teaspoons. BTW, I had to make this recipe after seeing peacefulnightdove's photo! Thank you so much Sharon."
145352,48760,2006-08-13,5,"Very delicious!!!! A dish I'll be making again and again, cuz it's very fast and great!"
51011,48760,2006-08-20,2,"I guess that we are the only people in the world who didn't like this recipe... Dh ate one bite & asked for something else.  I really wanted to like it, but the flavor was off for me.  I had never used hoisin sauce before, so perhaps that is why we didn't like it.  Sorry for the low rating!"
89831,48760,2006-09-15,5,"I wish I could rate this way more than 5 stars, this recipe is FANTASTIC! I pretty much made this as stated only with a couple minor amount adjustments, I am going to try this using pork or beef strips next time, we loved this, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten:)"
347822,48760,2006-10-25,4,"Great meal.  I used ground pork instead of beef.  Also, 1 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper is great for those folks that like an extra kick, if not, slightly reduce the amount but do omit it - it works well with the ginger (in my opinion the secret ingredients). "
59473,48760,2006-11-16,5,We really enjoyed this nice spicy dish. I did cut back a little on the crushed red pepper and hoisin sauce. Both DH and I thought it would be better with regular noodles or rice which I will try next time. Thanks for a great recipe.
39835,48760,2006-12-30,4,"Very good over rice. This is a good emergency meal, as I have most of the ingredients on hand all the time and it goes together quickly. Thanks for sharing!"
140132,48760,2007-01-30,5,Yummmmmmmy!  I printed this recipe a while ago and finally got around to making it.....what was I thinking!  This is fantastic and we loved it.  I was a little concerned it would be a bit too spicy for my youngest but he had two helpings.....We will be making this alot. I used spaghetti instead of the vermicelli and only used half the crushed red peppers and it suited us perfect.....thankyou for a great recipe....Stephanie
46660,48760,2007-02-19,5,"This is GREAT!  What an awesome way to use ground beef!  I omitted the red pepper flakes since my heat-sensitive son was eating it, and I left out the green onions.  I did everything else as directed.  My onion-hating son chowed it down, and my ground beef-hating son did as well!  An all-around winner!  Thanks!"
280271,48760,2007-03-01,5,"1st review: Excellent dish that came together with ease. I had all the ingredients on hand. DH gave it a big thumbs up. It had a nice spicy kick to it. I will be making this again. Thanks for posting. Update: 3/1/07 Here I am again! This time I made it with ground Turkey and whole wheat vermicelli. It still came out excellent! Whenever DH says ""This is really good!"" I know I have a winner. This has such a great flavor to it. It's also so easy to make. Happy cooking! Thanks, again Sharon123 for posting."
178742,48760,2007-04-09,5,"We ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! It was such a different thing to do with hamburger. And it was simple and quick. I would totally do it with a sliced beef, such as flank, or round steak. I didn't have any fresh ginger, and could not find it in the grocery store, so I used the ground ginger I have. I used alot more garlic, like 2 tablespoons, cause we love garlic (well, I do, because Husband said ""I know you put more garlic then required!""), I used minced garlic from the jar. I also used about 2 tablespoons of dry crushed red pepper flakes, because we like heat.. Instead of vermicelli pasta, I used whole wheat spaghetti. I cooked my onion, garlic and red pepper flakes with my hamburger. Lastly, as others mentioned, the directions did not say where to add the sesame oil? So I added it after I tossed everything into the hamburger, and added the pasta last. This was a quick no hassle meal. The kind I like to do on a Saturday  if we do not order out. Thank you for sharing!"
158086,48760,2007-04-26,5,What this does to plain old ground sirloin is unreal....I was told this was orgasmic....so I take that as good....will be making this often with the reaction I got from it...haha
74281,48760,2007-05-01,4,"I only gave this 4 stars becasue after making the sauce and tasting it, I really expected it to be sweeter and so I was a bit put off by the taste. I added 3 packets of Splenda and that fixed it for me. I also left out the green onions my DH can't digest, used a Low Carb thickener instead of cornstarch and used Dreamfield's pasta for a low(er) carb version. This turned out to be really good! I'm sure we'll have this again soon."
182624,48760,2007-05-22,5,"This was AWESOME!  I've been eyeballing this one for some time and I'm so glad I finally got around to trying it!  I used turkey instead of beef and used the entire 1 1/3 pounds of meat; I didn't increase other ingredients but it still worked out okay.  I only had a scant 1/3 cup of hoisin sauce but thought the sweetness was just right so I'll do it that way again next time.  I also used angel hair pasta.  This was simple and very, very delicious!  THANKS!"
278113,48760,2007-05-23,5,"I really enjoyed this meal, what a great change of pace for ground meat!"
286851,48760,2007-05-26,4,"My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make, came together quickly and I had most of the ingredients on hand. I followed it as written, using extra-lean ground beef. It truly is quite spicy (maybe a bit too spicy for me), but my husband, who loves especially spicy things, thought it was perfect. It was definitely too spicy for our two young children, however. I may cut back on the crushed red pepper next time, so they can enjoy this too. But we will be making it again. Thanks for sharing!"
97579,48760,2007-06-04,4,I like the taste of this dish and that it is a one dish meal.  I doubled the recipe and there was enough to serve 10 people.  Next time I will triple the sauce as it wasn't quite enough for our liking.  Thanks!
230557,48760,2007-06-07,4,"I followed this recipe exactly, except only used 1/4lb. of ground beef.  The flavor was great, the texture a little strange for an oriental dish (not bad, just a texture I usually associate with spaghetti sauce). Thanks!"
255338,48760,2007-10-31,5,"Made this last night for two teenage boys, along with 3 other dishes. I served this with rice instead of noodles, and it went together splendidly. This was the dish that was finished first, so it seems that they loved it. Very simple to make. Thank you for posting."
137911,48760,2007-11-16,5,Delicious and easy.  I added some broccoli to mine to make it a one dish meal.  Everyone loved it. I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.
125640,48760,2008-01-15,4,"Quick and different. The first time I made this it didn't go over very well. The general concensus was too spicy, way too much onion, and the hoisin sauce overpowered the rest of the sauce; everyone wanted to trade half of their dinner for something else. This time I used only 1 tsp red pepper, subbed cabbage for half of the onions, and for the sauce I used 3 tbsp hoisin sauce, 2 tbsp + 1 tsp oyster sauce (for a total of 1/3 cup), and 3 tbsp soy sauce. I also used rice noodles instead of vermicelli. Definately did the trick; my family thought it was very tasty this time and there wasn't a bite leftover. Thanks for sharing."
222564,48760,2008-02-04,4,Very tasty and quick to prepare!
369715,48760,2008-02-10,4,We had this for dinner tonight. We thought it was really good. I first doubled all the ingredients other then the hoisin sauce and red pepper. We didn't think it had enough sauce though so I then tripled the sauce. This suited our tastes and we all thought it was good. I also didn't add the green onions on top as my kids wouldn't have eaten then :)
447123,48760,2008-02-23,5,WOW!! What a great way to use some hamburger meat. I didn't have the green onions on hand BUT I did use something called broccoli slaw. I cooked it a little bit and threw it in with the mix. YUMMY!!! A GREAT way to trick thoes who dislike veggies. I definently will be making this again!! Thanks SharonBTW I used cabbage in this as well(about 2 cups) and it was GREAT!!)
13796,48760,2008-03-14,5,"Just yummy! This is a great recipe. I really enjoyed it. I cut the hoisin back to just 2 tablespoons and added 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce, too. I just about doubled the liquid because the sauce was just a little too thick for me. I didn't think it was spicy enough so I added some habanero peppers, too. I like things really spicy. This is a keeper, thanks."
55578,48760,2008-03-16,5,I had to add a bit of oyster sauce to the hoisin to make up the amount I needed (I doubled the spicy beef part).  I used 1 tsp of crushed red pepper which was plenty.  A nice Asian recipe.
199020,48760,2008-03-24,4,"Tasty - with a very unique flavor.  I think it would be better with more vegetables (maybe cole slaw mix, mushrooms, water chestnuts, you decide).  Thanks for sharing."
331557,48760,2008-04-29,4,This was pretty good and relatively quick to make.  I found that it took about 45 minutes as opposed to the 30 listed.  I used light soy sauce and about half of the hoisin sauce and crushed red pepper called for and it was spicy and sweet enough for our tastes.  I will make this again and serve with some mushrooms and broccoli as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks for posting!
59163,48760,2008-06-21,5,"Followed the recipe exactly, very easy and quick to make, nice blend of flavors.  The leftovers were also very good the next day for lunch."
497077,48760,2008-06-27,5,Delicious! What a great dish that is spicy and sweet and so flavorful-DH especially liked it. I followed recipe exactly except I served over white rice (didn't have vermicelli). I also added stir-fry vegetables and mini carrots to the meat mixture and frozen peas and corn to the rice. Served w/ hot and sour soup and salad w/ Recipe #1985. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!
250031,48760,2008-08-05,5,"Very good! My family is not a big ground beef fan so I cut up thin round steak into strips, browned them with the onions, garlic & ginger and used this sauce with the noodles and beef.  This goes on the ""make again"" list!"
532289,48760,2008-10-16,5,I have to give this 5 stars.  I asked DH how he liked it and he said it was excellent.  (I don't get that very often).  He wanted to eat the batch last night but the leftovers were already planned for his lunch today.  I had to substitute oyster sauce for the hoisin sauce.  (I have never used it).  I wasn't sure  if anything would work as a substitute but I read through the reviews and others said that it had worked.  I will try this again with the hoisin sauce.  I can't imagine it could be any better.  Thanks.
226863,48760,2008-12-09,5,"This was a very unique recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  I love the convenience of ground beef, although I used ground chuck because that is what I had.  But next time I think I will slice some sirloin really thin and use that.  I will also double the sauce and add some vegetables...broccoli and carrots, maybe some red bell pepper.  I absolutely love the flavor of the sauce, there just wasn't enough of it!  Thanks for posting a really tasty recipe!  Made for Everday is a Holiday tag."
969481,48760,2009-01-10,4,Made this the other night for dinner and it turned out pretty good. I think next time we make it will add another half pound of ground beef (per DH request). I did add a teaspoon of garlic and red chili paste too for some zip (again for the DH). A keeper for sure. Thanks!
142335,48760,2009-05-16,4,Great change of pace for ground beef and easy weeknight meal. I measured with my eyes and it still came together nicely....my kinda recipe. The addition of various vegetables could transform this into many different dishes. I added hot chili sauce...yum!
879716,48760,2009-05-27,4,"This was good but I think I need to tweak it a bit for it to become a favorite.  I didn't care much for the sweetness of the hoisin sauce so I think I may leave it out all together next time.  I love cooking with fresh ginger though so I'll definitely have to try this one again when my husband isn't sick and can handle the kick of spice!  I think it had the right amount of red pepper in it, but I may decrease it next time since it won't have the sweetness of the hoisin to temper the heat."
146047,48760,2009-07-02,5,"Loved this. So easy and definitely a nice change of pace with ground beef. I used sriracha rather than dried crushed red peppers, and about 2 tablespoons of the hoisin. I also sauteed 3 small sliced yellow squash with the onions to make it a one-dish meal. Tasty! Thanks for posting."
126440,48760,2009-07-12,5,Great Szechuan noodle.  I made this minus the beef and served it with Recipe #187477.  Very filling meal.
142367,48760,2009-08-19,5,"Thank you for sharing this simple, tasty recipe!  I used whole wheat spaghetti -- it worked great."
810787,48760,2009-09-11,4,"We really enjoyed this dish. Next time I would do a few things different. I would double the sauce so there is more to cover the pasta. I would also add veggies, such as mushrooms. Definitely worth making again!"
80998,48760,2009-09-14,4,My husband really enjoyed this.  It was super easy to make.
355637,48760,2009-09-16,3,A little sweet for my tastes... would maybe leave out the hoisin or at least decrease the amount.
55729,48760,2009-09-29,4,"I do not often make Szechuan-style dishes (nor order in restaurants) so my comments might be out of place. I thought this was very one-dimensional. Even with the smaller amount of red pepper (1 tsp.) it was all heat, without any other flavors (except the slight backup of beef). The portions were also a little light, but since there are few vegetables in it, perhaps a side dish would be appropriate. I would have been inclined to award only three stars, except that my husband and my son both ate every bite - no mean feat."
37868,48760,2009-11-05,4,I love this recipe!! Great for something different to do with hamburger! The only thing I will do next time is cut back on the Red Pepper. But I must tell you I still love it..But only me and I have to find someone that will eat something a bit spicey!! Great Recipe! Thank You for sharing with us. Hugs
37779,48760,2009-12-30,4,"My kids thought we were having regular spaghetti and meatsauce and looked at me like I was koo-koo when they tasted it. A great ""gotcha"" moment. They now call this Chinese spaghetti. I used 1 teaspoon pepper flakes and that was just right for them. We liked the flavor, but I will probably add just a bit more ginger, for my taste. Thanks for the post."
1269015,48760,2010-12-01,4,"I made a vegan version by subbing the hoisin for soy sauce and the beef for red beans. Good meal! Just the right amount of spicy, easy to prepare, and the beans stand in really well for the beef. Thanks for sharing!"
240552,48760,2011-08-15,5,"We have this at least once a month.  It is an easy and yummy recipe that we love!  We generally use whole wheat noodles and add in extra carrots with the onions for some extra nutritional value.  Thanks for the great recipe, Sharon!"
103876,48760,2011-10-15,5,This turned out really good! My daughter was in the mood for lo mein and we had some leftover cooked pork loin so we put it together with this sauce. Easy and flavorful. Thanks for posting.
176615,48760,2012-12-20,5,"Made a good, quick dinner. Served with edamame. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
135887,95743,2004-09-04,5,Excellent!!  I made one for my daughter to take to her college apartment.  I have strict instructions from her roommate and neighbors that she is not to return from the weekend without another one!  Today I made it for home and everyone loves it!  Very rich.
169969,21363,2004-11-24,5,"I really am NOT a casserole fan....but boy was I pleasantly surprised!!! My BF said it was a 6 or 7! This dish was so good! I used some of the suggestions in the reviews as to the ingredients to add some more flavor;I used about a 1/4 cup of chopped onions, a tad more garlic,Italian Seasoned Tomato Sauce, Sargento's 4 Cheese Mixture and Shredded Parmesean. I served it with 4 cheese garlic bread and a side salad. Not one noodle remained! Thank you for such a quick, easy and tasty recipe!"
184723,21363,2005-01-29,5,"I have to say that you are my favorite chef on this site.  I've made a lot of your recipes and need to start reviewing them.  This was SOOO good!!!!!!!  I know whenever I make one of your recipes I can invite people over to eat without having to try it first, always turns out wonderful!!!! Thanks so much...  I added mozzarella too with this..."
50969,21363,2005-10-21,5,"i'm giving this 5*'s for the taste, it was just so great.i didn't know when i was supposed to add the sugar, so i added it when i added the sauce to the hamburger.it was really easy to make.we had gotten alot more than 4 servings,as a matter of fact we got 8 servings out of this.this would be a great dish to take to a potluck dinner.this will be made again at our home.thank you for posting."
278113,21363,2006-03-08,4,"Really good, and much easier then making the lasagna!!"
22015,21363,2006-03-24,4,"I got mixed reviews from my family.   One really like this, two said it was okay and the fourth didn't care for it.   It seemed like it was the kids that loved it and the adults that were so so."
55729,21363,2006-05-20,5,This was so good! I also passed the recipe on to a friend who made and loved it as well. I did use some spaghetti that I had on hand.
178742,21363,2006-07-31,5,"I made the hamburger noodle bake Saturday, and we really really enjoyed it. The cream cheese and the sour cream made it creamy! It was quick, simple, and not from a box! I did as some of the others that reviewed it did by adding the cream cheese and sour cream to the sauce. Much easier! I added mushrooms, and onions to my sauce, and I used fresh mozzerela and sharp cheddar cheeses. This was definitely a winner and thank you for sharing!"
222433,21363,2006-09-21,4,"My teenage boys thought this was a little too sour creamy, but my husband and I thought it was great. I doubled the recipe, but kept the hamburger at one pound and it was plenty meaty. Definitely great with salad and bread! Thanks MizzNezz"
255338,21363,2006-10-15,5,A great recipe that will surely be a mainstay at our home. Followed directions to the letter and was rewarded by a yummy meal. Thank you so much for posting.
173579,21363,2006-11-08,3,My family really didn't care for this so much.  Thought it had kind of a sour taste.  Thanks for posting.
55578,21363,2007-03-27,5,"I made this up for DS.  He loved it!!  I added some frozen peas and some sliced black olives for a little umph.  I also halved it and it will be enough for 2 meals for him.  By the way, he ate like crazy the first day!! All he could say was UMMMMM! Thanks for the recipe, very easy to throw together."
125640,21363,2007-08-14,4,"Overall this was good; however, I wasn't totally sold on the sour cream/cream cheese layer. I think I would really love this dish using ricotta cheese (maybe mixed with a little heavy cream) instead for that layer. Thanks for sharing."
486718,21363,2007-12-10,4,"This was pretty good. I made as is and it was a little dry for my taste so I will probable increase the tomato sauce next time. Also, I will add more spice to give it more of a lasagna taste.  Very simple to put together and was even better the next day. Thanks!"
632249,21363,2007-12-16,4,This dish went together quick and easy.  We found it had a bit too much sour cream taste so next time I will decrease the sour cream  and maybe add a bit more tomato sauce. It is definitely a nice dish.
620763,21363,2008-01-31,4,I reduced the sour cream to 4 oz as others suggested. The combination of the sour cream and cream cheese makes this dish really tasty. I topped mine with parmesan cheese.
579298,21363,2008-02-01,2,"This was OK - I LOVE cream cheese and sour cream, but I really didn't fancy the sour cream taste in this meal."
377581,21363,2008-02-05,5,Yum...this is sooo tasty. This recipe is very fast and easy to make. Good reheated in the microwave as leftovers too. I  would definitely make this again. Thank you!
248023,21363,2008-02-11,4,"I love the taste of homemade lasagna but hate the work involved in making one... This was the solution!!!  I used extra lean ground beef and elbow noodles.  When I went to get the sour cream and cream cheese, there was barely any left, so I took some low fat cottage cheese and pureed half of it until it was thick and creamy and stirred in what little I had of the sour and cream cheese.  It was yummy!!! I think I may add more tomato sauce next time b/c my BF and I like our lasagna very wet...  Thanks for sharing!!!"
142367,21363,2008-03-02,4,This was good and easy to put together.  I think it really needs some oregano or basil or perhaps both to jazz it up a bit and will try adding these next time.  Thank you for sharing.
368078,21363,2008-04-20,5,"mmmmm...mizznezz's recipes are always so good, and this one is no exception!  We made this using ground turkey, but that was the only change we made.  It turned out amazing!  We thought that the sour cream/cream cheese combo was just the right amount, although it does make it very rich, so a little bit of this dish is very filling.  I would agree with another poster that it is 4 generous servings and I feel it could easily serve 6 if you served it with salad and bread to make a full meal.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe - this one is going in our ""keeper"" file! :)"
131021,21363,2008-12-22,4,We enjoyed this a lot. I mixed the cream ccheese and sour cream into the noodles so I only had 2 layers. I think next time I am going to mix in some parmesan cheese with the cream cheese mixture. I also used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I think we will make this again as it is so easy to make quickly.
140132,21363,2009-01-05,5,"Wow, great dish.  I love the simplicity of the whole dish and my family loved it.  Thank you for posting."
173314,21363,2009-01-20,5,added taco seasoning to meat w/water as required...all else same... great make ahead meal. thanks
229524,21363,2009-02-02,4,Very good.  Easy to make.  Used Ziti for the pasta.
789516,21363,2009-03-04,4,"Nothing fancy, but it was quick and easy to make, I had all the ingredients on hand.. and there was little clean up."
126440,21363,2010-05-09,5,Very good.  I made half a recipe but used onion and chive cream cheese.  Delicious.
653438,21363,2012-12-20,5,"Made for Zaar Cookbook tag game...this was an easy and tasty dinner.  I did cut the recipe in half and added more garlic, chopped onions and mushrooms.  I also combined all the ingredients and put in a dish to bake.  The grandkids gobbled this down with no complaints.  Thank you for posting."
35526,43023,2003-02-28,5,I added fresh mushrooms to make a main course.  Very good!
52125,43023,2006-09-14,5,This tasted so wonderful and yet it was so easy to fix! This is a winner. Thanks Karen=^..^=....
37036,43023,2004-11-15,4,"My family really enjoyed these noodles.  I followed the directions exactly, using chicken broth.  I felt like it was missing a little something... perhaps one more clove of garlic more cheese next time around.  Will make again!  Thanks Karen! "
176615,43023,2005-10-08,5,"Delicious, quick side dish. I doubled the garlic and otherwise wouldn't change a thing. Creamy without being heavy. Homemade stock will add the best flavor. Thanks, Karen, for posting!"
222433,43023,2006-08-23,5,Really good and fast. Great with sauted zucchini from the garden!! The whole family loved it! Thanks Karen! Will be making this again!
47907,43023,2006-08-28,5,"Very good and quick to make!  I served it with <a href=""/112368"">Paula's Smoked Boston Butt Roast</a> and it was the perfect accompaniament.  I did add another clove of minced garlic just becasue we like garlic otherwise I made as posted.  Thanks so much!"
188119,43023,2006-10-08,5,"I forget when I made this recipe, but it was really quick and very easy to make.  It also tasted great too!  Thanks"
51011,43023,2006-10-11,5,"Yum yum yum!! I have to admit I am very spoiled/lazy and usually drag out a boxed pasta mix to go with dinner.  Well it was the night before grocery day, and I was out of mix, so I decided to try this since I already had everything to make it.  So easy and good!  Only change was that I omited the parmesan cheese (dh's request)."
191533,43023,2006-10-17,5,Delicious!
236170,43023,2006-11-16,5,We loved this! My DH even went back for thirds! Next time I will make more sauce as it could've used a little more moisture. But even a little dry it was still delicious! Thanks Karen!
347822,43023,2006-11-16,4,"Great sauce, as recommended, I doubled the recipe.  Also, I used 2 tbsp of freshly chopped parsley and freshly grated parmesan both in the sauce and as a topping.  Note - use patience when thickening the sauce, it takes more than a minute of whisking to see any results."
362983,43023,2006-12-01,4,"I enjoyed this, and I think everyone else did because it all disappeared pretty fast! I added spinach and chicken (30391) and red pepper flakes but it was still sort of bland to me though. I'll probably play around with this recipe a bit to make it more interesting. This was definitely fun recipe to try since I've only made pasta with red sauces before; thank you!"
373817,43023,2007-02-13,5,"I made this today for lunch. I really liked it, as did my 2 year old! I made it exactly as directed, except I cut the recipe in half. I'll definitely make this again!"
329638,43023,2007-04-24,5,"Delicious!!  I threw in some chopped steamed broccoli at the very end, and everyone loved it.  Even Dh (who can be pretty picky) requested it to be included in our regular rotation.  Thanks for posting!"
59780,43023,2007-04-25,5,This is a great side dish that comes together fast. We all really enjoyed this and we'll be making this again soon!
251626,43023,2007-04-26,5,Really good. I doubled the sauce as others suggested and it was really nice. A ton of possibilities here. It would be great with almost anything.
189616,43023,2007-07-09,5,"Karen this was awesome-how awesome? Well my eldest DS wanted me to give him 2 more helpings!
Served this with recipe#19967 and recipe#119010
Thank You Karen!"
158086,43023,2007-07-23,5,loved this recipe...I made it with beef broth and added a little shallots....was a great side dish and so easy....everyone raved about it...
125640,43023,2007-08-01,4,"Quick and easy. To make it a complete meal I added 1/4 frozen peas, some sliced mushrooms, and 1 lb pork sauteed with garlic salt and pepper. Tasted good. Thanks."
229524,43023,2007-10-20,5,"Love, this recipe.  The flavor is so FANTASTIC!!!!! I couldn't stop eating it :).  I did double the sauce and added some fresh mushrooms and peas as others had suggested.  I had some 1/2 n 1/2 that I needed to use up, so that's what I used instead of the milk. Will be making this often and this will certainly be in our top 10 favorite recipes."
231054,43023,2007-10-22,5,"I don't how this review slipped by me.  I was sure I had submitted one -- but I came back to print the recipe off again and noticed there was nothing posted.  This is a fabulous recipe -- it goes with so many different dishes.  My grandkids really liked it -- it's very, very kid friendly.  My oldest grandson is coming to spend the weekend -- so that's why I wanted to print it off again!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with so many of us."
632249,43023,2008-01-20,4,We liked this but I was out of my usual brand of chicken broth so substituted it with a store brand which I think affected the taste. Will try this again as it is a great base with alot of possibilities.
294000,43023,2008-04-18,5,Fantastic and easy.  My husband made this as I was headed out the door.  He did end up doubling the sauce and adding chicken.  Will definitely make again.  So glad we found this.  Thanks.
100526,43023,2008-04-22,5,"This is an excellent dish that lends itself to many additions. I followed others remarks and added more than twice the amount of cheese in the recipe. I did not have any fresh Parmesan cheese to grate, but will be sure to use the fresh cheese next time. I also put a bit of Pecorino Romano Cheese in place of some of the Parmesan cheese. It adds a nice ""tang"" to the sauce!

I also added bit more garlic to my families ""taste"".

Next time I am going to add some Sun Dried Tomatoes and some grilled chicken strips to the dish.

Easy, quick and delicious! This recipe makes you feel like a real chef!"
145352,43023,2008-05-06,5,"Great!!!! I used some advice from previous reviewers and added chicken, roasted bell peppers, and doubled the sauce!!! My family loved it!!!"
377581,43023,2008-07-15,4,"It was pretty good. The flavor reminded me of Lipton alfredo noodles. I added cubed chicken breast and more garlic. It was fast, fairly healthy and I had all the ingredients on hand. I will experiment with different seasonings though, as I feel it was a bit bland. Thank you.

I tired this again with 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon each pepper and Italian seasoning, and 4 cloves of garlic. Delicious!"
140806,43023,2008-08-11,4,"I battled with DH about what rating to give this recipe. The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken. As a vegetarian, I loved it tossed with baby peas and extra cracked black pepper. Dh felt it was a good foundation but needed a protein or some extra flavor. He actually added bacon bits. A bit embarrassing, but he really like it that way. This recipe is a great and light alternative to fettuccini alfredo."
470351,43023,2008-10-19,4,"VERY rich, creamy and tasty pasta side dish!  I made this with salmon and cajun cauliflower and it was a nice pairing.  This is VERY rich, even using 1% mil.  I increased the garlic and followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  Very nice.  Will make this again."
60992,43023,2009-04-09,4,"The family did enjoy this recipe. I doubled the sauce after reading several reviews and used chicken broth. I also added a generous dash of red pepper flakes. While we enjoyed it, we did feel it was lacking something that we couldn't quite put our fingers on, but would have a good time trying to figure out what!"
180090,43023,2009-06-13,5,"Great recipe! So easy and I always have the ingredients on hand. I used half the amount of pasta but kept the sauce the same. I could eat this all the time. The garlic gives it a wonderful flavor and the sauciness is delicious. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, it's now one of my favorites!"
27643,43023,2009-10-17,5,I love these quick and easy recipes! This one has a lot of flavor. I made with chicken broth. Dh is already ready to have this again. Just need a simple salad on the side. Very good recipe! Thanks Karen!
937635,43023,2009-10-21,5,This is a great basic recipe because it is easy and quick and tastes great. I think I'll add mushrooms next time and maybe some red pepper flakes. I'm looking forward to hearing more about how other people have modified it. Thanks!
1269015,43023,2009-12-30,5,"I used olive oil instead of butter, wheat flour, and veggie broth, and this stuff was great! And very easy to make. Absolutely my favorite pasta dish. We've served it with lightly breaded asparagus spears, and with broccoli mixed in. Yum!"
810787,43023,2010-01-10,3,Has potential but we thought it was bland.
15521,43023,2010-01-23,5,"Very good, simple to make and a hit with my kids!  It does have a very mild flavor, so next time I might add some extra herbs to spice it up a little bit more."
13483,43023,2010-02-02,4,I really liked how simple and easy this was to do.  I did find it a little bland though.  Perhaps a bit of hot sauce or stronger cheese will help next time.
333017,43023,2010-02-22,0,"I am not going to rate this because I did exchange enough of the ingredients to change the recipe.  Instead of the penne, I used a good quality dried fettuccine and used whipping cream for the chicken broth and part of the milk (because I had to use it up).  As much as we did like it, I did find it a little on the  bland side, so next time, I will up the salt and pepper and add a bit more parmesan cheese.  Adding lemon juice might give it a nice zip too."
33159,43023,2010-04-27,5,"This is an absolutely amazing recipe!!  Sooooooooooo much flavour!  So easy to make!  I used skim milk, low fat parmesan & fat free chicken broth so it worked out to only about 6 grams of fat per 1 cup and still tasted rich & decadent.  I served with a grilled & sliced chicken breast & it looked beautiful, too!"
371738,43023,2010-09-05,0,"Truly an easy and tasty pasta!!  Kids loved it.  A definite keeper, though I did halve the pasta amount and kept all other measurements as directed, and thought it was perfect that way.  Thank you!!!"
124190,43023,2011-01-12,5,So good. Great way to have alfredo without all the fat and calories! I highly recommend!
928301,43023,2011-06-24,5,"Very good!  The strong garlic smell during the first few steps had me scared, but it turned out great!"
789516,43023,2011-04-29,4,A very good base recipe.  I added blackened chicken to it and it made the dish!
203111,43023,2011-07-19,4,"Decided to try this for my Meatless Monday and really liked it.  Reduced to 1 serving, used ziti rather than penne and added 1/2 small can of drained mushrooms, otherwise followed recipe.  It was nice and creamy and very tasty.  Thanks!"
2041603,43023,2011-10-26,5,Wow! I made this when friends came over and they gobbled it up! Great dish!
847160,43023,2011-11-22,3,that was ok and super fast
173579,43023,2012-04-15,5,I had this for a family gathering.  Everyone loved it.  It was so simple to make.  Thanks for posting.
1179225,43023,2012-08-30,4,"This was a very simple and tasty sauce. I served with it over spaghetti and topped with meatballs. I only used a 1/2 lb. of pasta, but made the full recipe for the sauce.Thanks for posting."
198154,43023,2012-09-29,3,"We are big garlic lovers in our house so, like I do with every recipe, I doubled the garlic.  Even with that change my family didn't find it had enough flavor.  They gave it three stars. They liked it better when we added additional garlic salt with parsley, fresh cracked pepper, and topped it off with additional fresh grated parm.   I served it with steamed broccoli."
540346,43023,2013-01-25,5,"I really liked this and my kids all ate it without complaint.  I made as directed, adding a bag of frozen broccoli stir-fry to the sauce and cooking about 5 minutes.  This was very easy and I will make again."
203325,43023,2013-05-12,5,What an awesome side dish and so easy to make.  We will be making this again.
315055,43023,2014-01-29,3,"This turned out pretty bland.  The sauce was pretty thin, and it didn&#039;t taste like much more than noodles.  =/"
32058,43023,2014-06-30,5,"Amazing.  I used evaporated D Milk because I had some on hand, but otherwise did exactly as recipe stated. Perfect side dish to round out any meal."
620763,43023,2016-02-08,5,This is a great  pasta dish! I added peas. I used 1/2 box of pasta but made full amount of sauce. Delicious!
35526,21882,2004-02-17,5,"This is Low Carb Heaven!!!!I left off the breadcrumbs, didn't need em, IMO.  Simple preparation, I had all the ingredients on hand and we had a main dish that tasted like I spent alot more time and money on it.  I served with fresh steamed veggies and some white beans.  Great dish!"
169969,21882,2004-12-29,5,"This dish was so good I just had to post another 5 star review! Great flavor and so easy. I prepared it exactly as written except I put the mushrooms under the cheese and used prepared pesto. I covered the dish for first 20 minutes with a sheet of foil so the cheese would not burn. Excellent! I served it with bowtie pasta with pesto,  Artichoke Bruschetta(#103152) and Walnut/Cranberry salads. Thank you for posting this great recipe!"
119466,21882,2005-03-08,5,"A nice, simple dish with wonderful flavor.I started with frozen breasts so I gave them a 15-20 minute head-start in the oven before I added the toppings.I used Trader Joe's prepared pesto and the breasts were pretty large so I used a full slice of cheese on each one. Next time I think I will put the mushrooms between the pesto & the cheese & also wait until a little closer to the end to put the cheese on. Great recipe--thanks for sharing it!"
184723,21882,2005-03-26,5,"I made this exactly as directed.  My six year old ate it, too!  It was GREAT!!!!!!!!! The only thing I wasn't sure of was whether to actually simmer the pesto like the pkg said.  I did before pouring over chicken and it turned out just fine!"
160974,21882,2005-05-08,5,"I made this for our Mother's Day dinner. I did coat my chicken with flour, egg wash, and seasoned bread crumbs and sauteed til almost done, and baked with the sauce. I added freshly sauteed mushrooms on half of chicken pieces. I really thought the mushrooms made it special, but not everyone in my family appreciates mushrooms the way I do! I did use Knorr packet of pesto sauce. Even though my chicken didn't need to bake long to cook through, I covered it with foil so it would stay ""melty."" I served this with my Giardiniera Lasagna  recipe #117371, which complemented each other nicely. This is a great chicken dish for company.

Roxygirl in Colo."
95743,21882,2005-07-02,5,"Scrumptious. Skipped the breadcrumbs, used fresh mushrooms and homemade pesto.  I put the chicken in the dish, topped with half the pesto, raw mushrooms, remaining pesto and then provolone.  Twenty minutes seemed plenty of time to bake the breasts. The liquid from the mushrooms waters down the pesto but sauteing them first until dry would avoid that problem.  "
222970,21882,2005-07-05,5,"Wonderful! Skipped the crumbs and used Classico prepared pesto and fresh sliced mushrooms. The second time making Chicken Pesto, I cooked it in the microwave, which didn't turn out as well, so I recommend using the oven method. A five star hit in here!"
470351,21882,2007-06-22,1,I think this recipe is only as good as the pesto you use.  I used pre-made pesto and had really high hopes for this recipe based upon the reviews and the ingredients...but I did not like the taste at all.
178742,21882,2007-08-06,5,"Another winner on RECIPEZAAR.. There is no other place I go for recipes, and if I do it's because I saw something on foodnetwork. Anyway, this recipe was sooooo delicious.. The only change I made was when I put the cheese on. I waited til there was about 20 minutes left.. However next time I think I will put it on when there is about 10 minutes to go.. It's just that I prefer my cheese bubbly, not golden brown and bubbly, which is the way it was.. It was fine though, I just know to do it differently next time. To go with my Chicken Pesto, I made linguini and tossed it with pesto and grated parmsean cheese.. I can't wait to try this dish out on family and friends.. Thanks soooo much for sharing!"
248023,21882,2008-01-31,5,"Wonderful dish!!!  I used Classico jarred pesto and swiss cheese as that is what I had in the house.  My chicken breasts were on the large side so I pounded them out slightly and cut them in half.  I used panko for the breadcrumbs and loved the crispy texture.  Since I cut my breasts in half I also cut the cook time in almost half.  Five minutes before taking them out, I sprinkled with a little mozzarella... YUM!  I served it with Recipe #167126 and a simple green salad.  Thanks for posting!!!"
389431,21882,2008-04-07,4,"This was good... nice and fresh tasting.
I only used 4 chicken breasts so I used the other half of the pesto sauce on spaghetti noodles and served the chicken on top... it looked very pretty and tasted just as good! Thanks so much!"
774665,21882,2008-07-13,5,We really enjoyed this! Next time I'll make my own mushrooms but other than that it came out perfect.  I served it with Recipe #26440 and it was a perfect meal.
26512,21882,2008-08-05,5,"Wow, I loved this recipe! We both did! I used homeade pesto from this site. I was concerned the bread crumbs would get soggy, but the chicken comes out crispy and moist from the cheese. I also used fresh, sliced mushrooms. Oh, I used monterey jack as well. Loved it, will be making this one many times in the future. So easy!!"
32058,21882,2008-08-21,5,GR8!  Used refrigerated pesto however.
80998,21882,2008-09-05,3,This was a quick and easy way to make chicken.  I used mckormick pesto mix.  This was a good easy meal.
969481,21882,2008-11-28,4,"This was good. I thought it was OK, but the DH said it was a keeper (and coming from him, you bet it stays in the rotation!). I served this with Penne Arrabiatta #22941 a salad and some sweet rolls. Thanks for posting!"
914720,21882,2008-12-07,5,"This was fabulous, and amazingly easy.  I omitted the mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Most of the cheese melted off the chicken into the pan, but I just scooped it up with the sauce and served it over bow tie pasta.  This would be a nice, impressive dinner for company, as well.  Thanks for sharing!"
269331,21882,2009-01-30,5,"FABULIOUS!  I used thin sliced chicken filets and my own homemade pesto.  I also used the suggestion of another reviewer and dipped my chicken in melted butter, instead of water :-)  Definitely company worth!"
140132,21882,2009-03-06,5,DELICIOUS!!!  I love pesto and adding it to chicken is amazing.  My family really enjoyed this dish and has requested it to be made often.  Thank you for posting.
637486,21882,2009-06-02,5,This was a great new way to cook chicken!  I omitted the mushroom just because I don't like them and it turned out great!  I used Classico jarred pesto sauce and swiss cheese since that's what I had on hand!  Thanks for sharing.
158086,21882,2009-06-04,5,Add us to the list of the many people that have loved this recipe...I too put the mushrooms on before the cheese...I doubled the pesto sauce and glad I did...I used chicken tenderloins and it turned out perfect...looking forward to the leftover tonite.
937635,21882,2009-06-08,5,"Great easy recipe! I liked it a lot, but my SO thought it was too cheesy. I used chicken tenders and dipped them in butter like a PP suggested. I also used the Italian Bread Crumbs Recipe (http://www.recipezaar.com/Italian-Bread-Crumbs-54348). Yummmm! Thanks!"
126440,21882,2009-07-03,5,"I made this for two and used pesto, and fresh sauteed mushrooms.  Very easy to do and has wonderful flavor.  Served it with Recipe #30051."
44383,21882,2010-12-28,5,"This has quickly become our favorite way to do chicken breasts. I made it for the third time tonight and it is absolutely delicious.  I could not find packaged pesto either and used a jar of it instead and also use the entire package of provolone, 2 slices each breast.  So good and impossibly easy to prepare.  This is a great beginner cook's recipe to impress friends and family with.  A simple side of asiago stuffed ravioli and we ate like royalty tonight."
810787,21882,2011-01-19,5,Amazing. So simple and SO good!
64203,21882,2014-04-16,5,I really appreciate how simple this was to put together... in the summer I&#039;ll even make my own pesto which will make it even better! Thanks for the recipe!
839492,21882,2015-03-18,4,"Made the http://www.food.com/recipe/speedy-spinach-pesto-176624 recipe from this site (which is excellent, btw) and used it in this dish. I left out the breadcrumbs completely (low carb) and followed the recipe with the addition  of purchased fresh 3 cheese ravioli, a little wine, chicken stock and placed in the same skillet in the oven, covered for about an hour. I was delicious and one pan clean up made it that much better!"
9869,98415,2005-01-16,5,"These go straight in to my very favourite zaar recipe folder.
Light, fluffy and delicious.
Served with a knob of butter and maple syrup.
Thanks for sharing."
52543,98415,2004-09-27,5,"I haven't been to IHOP in years so I can't compare but these were excellent pancakes - light & fluffy! Since I had only 1 cup of buttermilk, I topped it up with 1% milk. Delicious with warm Blueberry Sauce (#78222). Thanx Mandy!"
146047,98415,2005-06-07,5,"These pancakes are really tasty, Mandy! They're even amenable to messing around a bit with the flours. I used 1/4 c soy flour and about 1/3 c whole wheat pastry flour for part of the all-purpose type. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1/2 c plain yogurt and 1 c vanilla soy milk (which I soured with some ascorbic acid). I let the batter sit for about 45 minutes or so before cooking them up, and they were indeed light and tasty. The batter's quite sweet, but the end result is just right, delicious with syrup and a few walnuts sprinkled on top. Thanks!"
60992,98415,2005-10-12,5,"Tender, tasty and easy are three adjectives that would describe these pancakes. I have not had IHOP's pancakes, so I cannot compare them. The family gobbled these up in no time flat. I did not have buttermilk but substituted buttermilk powder with no ill effects. I also added a splash if vanilla as my family loves the flavor it adds to the batter. This is a keeper for sure."
145352,98415,2006-02-28,5,"Delicious!!!! I followed it to a ""T"" and it made 10 pancakes!"
185285,98415,2006-04-27,5,"Pretty good pancake! I used LF buttermilk, which may have made them a bit thinner than I would have liked, but they tasted delicious."
29782,98415,2006-07-09,5,YUM! love this recipe. Turned out great! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
173579,98415,2006-07-21,5,These were so nice and fluffy.  Will make these again.  Thanks for posting.
64583,98415,2006-07-25,5,"Great pancakes!  They have a bit of a sweetness and a very nice fluffy texture.  I've tried several pancake recipes on Zaar and liked them all, but this one is now the only one I'll be using.  My daughter requested chocolate chip pancakes, so I threw some chocolate chips in some of the batter and it worked out great.    "
8688,98415,2007-10-06,5,"This is a superior recipe for buttermilk pancakes!  We like ours a bit thinner than most buttermilk pancake recipes, so I added about 3/4 cup more buttermilk to  the batter.  The results were exceptional!  I served with real Canadian maple syrup and blueberry syrup.  This recipe will go into my permanent cookbook for future use.  Thank you so much, Mandy!"
58836,98415,2007-11-09,5,"I've found the best pancake recipe in this one.  They were very good, even dh said so.  I know I will use this from now on.  Thanks!"
347822,98415,2007-11-15,5,"Great pancakes! In one bowl, I mixed the dry ingredients, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  In another bowl, I mixed my wet ingredients, egg, buttermilk, vegetable and 1 tsp vanilla (my addition).  Once mixed, I gradually added the dry ingredients, to prevent the batter from getting lumpy. The reason why I don't throw all the ingredients into a bowl and mix is because the recipe calls for baking soda and powder, to prevent the batter from potentially tasting powdery, I mix it with the flour first then with the rest of the ingredients.  Thank you for a great recipe."
126104,98415,2008-03-02,5,"That's right, I've never been to IHop.  I've only seen commercials on TV.

These were very good.  I had only 2 eggs this morning, and knew that meant nothing to have tomorrow.  I decided I'd just mix up pancakes, and since I had buttermilk here that's about to spoil, I thought I'd use that up to.  I was VERY happy with the results.

They were nice and fluffy and just most enjoyable.  I might add blueberries the next time, because that just sounds like a nice addition."
359220,98415,2008-04-10,5,Can't believe I forgot to rate these!  DH and I like to have breakfast for dinner every once in a while and these were great sprinkled with blueberries.  I always add a bit of lemon juice to all my pancakes and between that and the buttermilk these had a nice subtle tang to them.  These are the standard now!
37636,98415,2008-05-01,4,"These were good! The batter does remind me of Ihop as their batter runs a little thin. I recommend letting the batter sit for 10-15 minutes to thicken up so the pancakes won't be so thin they tear apart. Makes ten nice pancakes if you use 1/4 cup batter per. Give them room as they spread on the griddle. Thanks for posting, Mandy!"
111291,98415,2008-06-30,5,"These are delicious! I did add 1 tsp. vanilla, but other than that, I made them just as posted and was not disappointed! As others suggested, next time I make them I will let them sit for at bit to make them even better. Thanks for posting! NOTE: I'm making these today for the 3rd or 4th time and was out of all-purpose flour, so I used bread flour instead and also added 1/2 tsp. salt. These turned out the BEST out of all the times I made them. They were extra fluffy and full of flavor!! I will continue to use bread flour and 1/2 tsp. salt when making this recipe!"
394077,98415,2009-01-24,5,"This morning, I made this pancakes for one person only.  So I tried to half the recipe with all the ingredients except keeping 1 egg.  Well, the pancakes came out so good.  They are light and fluffly with a perfect sweetness.  I was able to make 3 nice size pancakes out of half batter.  The guest loved them and asked for the recipe.  I called the ingredients out to her and guess what?  I forgot the oil in the batter.  DUH!!! Anyway, this recipe is very forgiving and turned out great even with my big mistake.  Thanks for posting it."
140132,98415,2009-02-10,4,"Very good pancakes.  I think I have found my pancake recipe of choice.  Thank you for posting, I will use often."
298447,98415,2012-03-13,5,"These pancakes hit the spot!  I dunno if they taste like IHOP's, but nevertheless, they taste great.  My family especially enjoys having these pancakes when we have breakfast for dinner.  I never have buttermilk in the fridge, so I always use Recipe #430334 which works like a charm.  Thanks."
168462,98415,2012-05-28,5,These were easy to make and tastes great. Thanks for the recipe.
285039,98415,2012-08-11,5,"Excellent!  Next time I would probably decrease the sugar by 1/2.  I used these as the foundation for a breakfast for dinner sandwich with egg, ham and cheese and it was absolutely delicious!"
126440,98415,2013-07-16,5,Great pancakes.  Just perfect to flip.  Served with homemade chokecherry syrup and sausage.  YUM.
305531,98415,2013-09-13,5,Great pancakes. I made a buttermilk substitute and we really enjoyed these light fluffy pancakes. Thanks for sharing. Made for Zaar Alphabet Soup Tag.
222564,98415,2014-10-17,5,Light and fluffy and just perfect!
176615,98415,2015-06-16,5,Very tasty pancakes. Thanks for the recipe!
198154,98415,2016-01-25,5,"When schools were closed for a snow day, meetings were cancelled and DH gt to work from home, replacing our crazy, hectic weekday morning with a yummy breakfast just sounded like the thing to do. We had buttermilk that needed to be used up so I searched the recipes for one we hadn&#039;t tried yet and this is what we came up with. Served them with either powdered sugar or real maple syrup. These are very close to IHOP pancakes.  DD said all we needed was IHOP&#039;s strawberry syrup (her favorite) and they would be perfect."
101823,106627,2005-01-01,5,The roasting brings out the wonderful sweetness of the butternut squash.  This is an excellent side dish that would compliment many meals.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar slightly and the dish was still scrumptious.
8629,106627,2005-03-13,5,"This was really great!  I thought making half of a recipe would be enough but now I am sorry that I didn't make the full recipe. I accidentally left the pan in the oven for about an additional 10-15 minutes after it was done and after I had shut off the oven.  So my squash was really, really carmelized.  It was great, though. This is a keeper.  Thank you. "
35526,106627,2005-03-20,5,"This is by far the best recipe I have ever tried for butternut squash.  It came out perfect, not too sweet.  Went perfectly with my turkey burger but I can see that it would work with just about anything. 45 minutes work perfectly for me. "
4470,106627,2005-09-01,5,"Delicious - I cut back on the sugar, roasted for 50 minutes cooked perfectly outside still firm lovely soft centers. great flavor  Thanks for a Keeper Piano lady"
124190,106627,2005-09-26,5,"Very good, despite my mistakes. I halved the recipe, but forgot to half the amount of sugar. It was still good though, just gooey. Next time I make this, I will half things properly. Very, very good, and very, very easy. Thanks!"
13483,106627,2005-10-17,5,I've been roasting just about any veggie except squash. . . until now!!  These were really good.  I used olive oil instead of butter and a little less sugar as the squash were plenty sweet on their own.  Great veggie dish.  Thanks Pianolady.
119466,106627,2007-01-30,5,About all I can think of to say about this dish is that it is absolutely delicious! :) Thanks so much for posting!
176615,106627,2005-10-21,5,"Excellent! I can't think of a vegetable I DON'T like roasted, but this makes butternut squash fantastic. Be sure to let the outside of the squash get nice and brown, I think it adds a great deal more flavor. What a wonderful fall side dish. Thanks, Pianolady!"
52543,106627,2005-11-18,5,"We're big squash lovers & we loved this version! Since I hate to get my hands all sticky, I mixed everything in a large bowl with a rubber spatula, then scaped onto my baking tray. I think that Geema is right ........ I'm lazy & lined the tray with parchment to reduce cleanup time. But next time, I'll put up with a messy tray to get more caramelization; I'm sure it will be worth it. Thanx PianoLady!"
160974,106627,2005-11-30,5,"The carmelization that occurs with the butter and brown sugar really makes some ""magic"" in the oven. A lot of times I skimp on salt, but have found that Ina Garten knows the right amount for her recipes. It really accents the flavors.

169969,106627,2006-03-16,5,Add me as a fan too! This was super easy and really good! The picky four year old actually ate it without argument! I did not find it as sweet as I thought it would be. It was perfect! I tossed everything in a bowl and then spread it out on a baking sheet. Thank you for a great squash recipe.
47907,106627,2006-08-25,5,I can't believe I forgot to review this recipe!  This is such a yummy recipe  The squash comes out of the oven tasting like candy!  The hardest part is peeling the butternut.  I made as posted and I will be making it often this fall and winter.  Thanks for posting!
278113,106627,2006-10-09,5,"I chose this recipe to use for my first time ever preparing/eating butternut squash..and man, am I hooked!! So easy, and YUMMY!!"
27643,106627,2006-11-09,5,"I loved this! My DH went bonkers! We've found out he has type 2 diabetes, and it's been hard to adjust some recipes. This one was easy. I used a mixture of Splenda and brown Splenda, followed cooking directions as posted. It worked really well. He told me not to lose this recipe. :)"
280166,106627,2007-02-14,5,"Absolutely wonderful.  I only used 1 squash and had to stop myself from nibbling every time I went by the pan.  By the time my husabnd came home, there was barely enough for two servings.  Next time I will make the whole batch, but like other reviewers I think I will reduce the sugar and butter.  Definitely 10 stars and went perfect with the pork loin I cooked for Valentine's Day!"
324621,106627,2007-04-09,4,"Made this to go along with our Easter lunch yesterday, and I thought it was pretty good. I had a small 1 pound Butternut squash, so I had to adjust the recipe accordingly. Overall, I was pleased with the results."
158086,106627,2007-09-26,5,This is out of this world....We loved it...going to put this recipe in my holiday cookbook as it would be great for thanksgiving and you could make it ahead of time....the hardest part is peeling that darn thing... I used splenda brown sugar and it was perfect.
174991,106627,2007-10-17,5,"This is the first time that I used butternut squash and I'm very happy with this recipe.  It's easy to put together, after you peel it, and is so tasty."
60260,106627,2007-10-28,5,"Oh wow!  I was going to make soup out of my squash and then decided to try this recipe instead.  We loved it, the kids gobbled it up like there was no tomorrow.  I cut my pieces a bit small so the cook time should have been cut back - my pieces were pretty soft. The sweet/salt/pepper is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing and look forward to making it again soon."
177933,106627,2007-11-01,5,"Amazingly wonderful!  I had one squash, used 6 tbl of butter and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I loved it and am stuffed with it.  My husband enjoyed it and my kids tried it, but they didn't love it...what is wrong with them, it's like candy!  Anyway, thank you this is a keeper for sure!"
222970,106627,2008-01-20,5,"Boy, this one should get 10 stars.

Even though I made it myself, it was a little disconcerting to eat at first since it looked like sweet potato but sure didn't taste like it!

Very excellent. Some of the kids didn't try it, but they missed out.

I mixed the squash, butter, sugar, and salt and pepper in a gallon bag before dumping in the pan.

Mmmm. I found a couple of sources for big butternut squashes at a dollar a piece and thought I had enough to store through the winter, but now I'm wishing I'd purchased more!"
125640,106627,2008-02-13,4,I used olive oil in place of half of the butter. Simple and really good. Thanks for sharing.
377581,106627,2008-07-14,4,This was very tasty. Thanks for posting.
394077,106627,2008-11-04,4,Mine didn't carmelized but the squash stills tastes great. Keeper.
499050,106627,2009-01-26,4,Very Good!
579298,106627,2009-02-25,5,"I didn't have an hour upon realizing that I wanted to cook butternut squash, so I decided to take a different approach with the cooking method. I peeled and diced the squash and put it in a microwaveable safe bowl with the seasonings and a few tablespoons of water and microwaved it for 10 minutes. Next, I put it in a baking dish omitting the butter and spraying it with olive oil spray instead. Lastly, I put it in the oven on 450 for 15 minutes until lightly browned. DELICIOUS!!"
637486,106627,2009-06-18,4,"This is really good...perhaps a bit on the sweet side, but still good!"
620763,106627,2009-11-12,3,This was OK. I cut mine into large chunks but they turned to mush. I would suggest a cooking time closer to 30 minutes.
250031,106627,2009-11-19,5,"made this, halving the recipe (as it was just for me) and the butter/brown sugar mixture began to burn--maybe because I halved the recipe and there was just too much room on the baking sheet. It also only took about 30 minutes to cook. I added cinnamon. It's delicious!"
969481,106627,2010-01-11,4,This was the first time I ever cooked squash. I read through the reviews and decided to add cinnamon and nutmeg because of family and kids preference. These turned out better than I expected. Thanks for sharing!
789516,106627,2010-02-18,5,"Wow.. this was superb!  I halved the recipe, it turned out great!"
1072593,106627,2010-07-11,5,"I had a butternut squash in my pantry for about 2 weeks and everytime my grandson would see it he'd say, ""Why you have Jerry?"" I'd think who the heck is Jerry?!? Come to find out he's a cartoon character. Well, I loathe the thought of telling him, Jerry's now a goner. On a happier note, this recipe is magical. Turns squash into candy."
126440,106627,2010-11-13,5,I have made this a number of times and just love it.  I usually only do one squash for the two of us and we still have leftovers for snacking.
103876,106627,2010-11-14,5,"Wow!  Where have I been that I haven't seen this recipe until today.  I was going to make the same old boring squash in the oven, but saw this and decided to try it.    It looked beautiful before I cooked it, but I wasn't sure how great it would be when finished.  Well, it was amazing!  It takes more time to prepare, but after having this way, I will never be able to go back.  I cut the recipe in half for one large squash and it was perfect.  Even used a bit less butter.  Already thinking about making it for Thanksgiving.  Thanks for posting!"
653438,106627,2011-01-26,5,"Made this last night and it was a big hit with everyone.  I cut the recipe in half and the salt a little but followed the rest of the instructions.  I am putting this into my Favorites of 2011 book.  Served this with Tri-tip steak, green beans, paprika/butter fried potatoes and the Realtor's Italian Salad Dressing#384154/salad.  P.S.  I will add a little more brown sugar for my own sweet tooth."
529278,106627,2011-09-14,5,"My husband and I really liked this.  So did our 1 year old.  The older two weren't so sure, but they aren't used to squash, so that could have been it.  It was a nice change from just cutting open a squash and baking with butter and brown sugar.  It did take a while to cut the squash (and since I'm already having problems with dry hands, I used gloves as someone suggested, which did slow me down some), but it was so easy.  And I love how by cutting it up and mixing the sauce in with my hands, I was able to coat all sides of every piece.  Delicious!"
145352,106627,2011-10-23,5,Delicious!! I used one butternut and one acorn.  MMMM!
126104,106627,2011-10-24,5,"I can't tell if the stars are showing up, but I'm rating this 5*.  It was really good.  My only issue is that I purchased squash that was already cut, and there were some pieces that were too small, and so the squash around the edge of the pan were a little burnt.  Next time, I will make sure that I check it a little sooner, and maybe just remove the smaller pieces.  Very easy; quite nice.  Next time, I'm going to try the Splenda substitute and see if it does anything but turn into a hard little ball."
222564,106627,2012-12-09,4,"Very good basic recipe, herbs and garlic etc. could be added. I like the notion in a review about not peeling the butternut squash. Most of the goodness is in the peel usually."
218535,106627,2013-02-17,5,Delicious. followed recipe as written.
42720,7108,2005-03-11,5,"I made this using Andouille which is highly seasoned Cajun smoked sausage.  I did not have creole mustard which would have spiced it up even more.  Instead, I used honey mustard and served this over rice as a main dish.    My guys really enjoyed it.  This is easily prepared and makes a quick evening meal or a great hearty appetizer.  "
54678,83524,2004-02-11,5,MMMMM Sometimes we forget how the most simplest preparation delivers comfort to the soul.
22015,83524,2004-06-17,4,"This is how I normally make cabbage for a side dish.  It's just plain, simple recipe that allows the flavor of the cabbage to come through without competing with other flavors."
55729,83524,2004-06-19,5,"I love this recipe! This was my first experience with cooking cabbage, and it is the one preparation I use most often (usually with extra butter!). I think the key is lower heat on the stove, as I like it when it caramelizes, too."
43083,83524,2004-06-19,5,This is THE recipe for cabbage! I am overzealous with the butter & salt and pepper..MMM simplicity at its best!
49304,83524,2005-01-18,5,"We love cabbage fixed this way, we like the edges carmlized. I sometimes add celery seeds to it, also like to add noodles. Thank you for posting a delicious recipe so that others may enjoy  cabbage fixed this way."
175824,83524,2005-01-23,5,"My mother always made this. She would fry her cabbage and then mix it with noodles, then bake it in the electric roaster. I know she used more butter. Sometimes she would also make her own dumplings and mix those with the fried cabbage. Yummy, what comfort food.
"
103876,83524,2005-01-30,5,"This was such an easy and delicious way to enjoy cabbage.  I have never made it this way before, but am sure I will be making again.  Thanks for posting."
68460,83524,2005-02-27,5,"There's no way I could not give this 5 stars!  I was the only one in the house who liked cabbage, so I rarely got to have it....I made this tonight and my husband ate more than I did!  My daughter liked it too!  I followed the recipe as written and I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks so much for posting this Boxerwing :)"
7108,83524,2005-02-28,5,"Yum!  For the family, as a side to Pork Schnitzel, I made this as directed then added some cooked egg noodles, mixed well and heated through, then served.  I've always made the ""cabbage and noodles"" dish, but only cooked the cabbage done enough for ""softness""; not actually ""carmelizing"" the cabbage.  I'll be making my cabbaage and noodles this way from now on.  I used about 3 Tbsp butter.  For me, on the South Beach diet, I ate as is before I added the noodles; this makes a tasty veggie low carb side dish.  Thanks for posting!"
133174,83524,2005-03-19,5,I will add my review to the 37 that have posted already.  This is so simple and delicious. I have used something similar for years.  I did add a sprinkling of fennel and some dried minced onion flakes.  Cooked it in my treasured cast iron skillet and served it with left over corned beef.  This is a keeper.
132764,83524,2005-03-20,5,This was great! So sweet and crispy and yummy. I will make this often.
51011,83524,2005-03-20,5,"This is super good and easy! We caught cabbage on sale last night, and dh remembered seeing this photo for cabbage as I surfed on zaar.  The instructions are easy, and the only change I made was to add a bit of sliced onion.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
9869,83524,2005-03-22,5,"Oh this is so tasty! What an easy delicious way to serve cabbage, thank you for sharing..it will become a favourite."
147109,83524,2005-04-08,5,"Wow, so I have to echo everybody else this is just a great way to make cabbage.  My husband has never had cabbage before, and was shocked at how tasty this was.  We had it with Baked Steak and seasoned baked potatoes. Thanks for this recipe!"
126104,83524,2005-05-14,5,"This is my favorite side dish now.  Some weeks, I follow the recipe exactly.  Some I add curry or caraway.  I usually fix an entire head of cabbage, and just warm it up all week.  Best leftover ever!!!"
59473,83524,2005-05-18,5,This was such a simple recipe but it was so good. I did add a little bit more butter than stated. Actually it was margarine. I will be making this again. The next time I think I might add some chopped onions. Thanks for a great recipe.
68960,83524,2006-01-12,5,This style of cooking is excellent. Very flavourful. I added caraway seeds. A definite make again recipe. Thanks for posting.
60992,83524,2006-01-29,5,This was good. I added a sliced onion to the cabbage and a sprinkling of creole seasoning just before serving. It went wonderfully with rotisserie chicken. Thanks for sharing this easy side dish.
101823,83524,2006-02-02,4,"This is simple comfort food for my husband.  He loves cooked cabbage.  I used half of a head of napa cabbage for the two of us, and he gobbled it all up.  It paired nicely with Turkey Meatloaf (recipe#77992) and Garlic Mashed Sweet Potatoes (recipe#123557)."
76951,83524,2006-08-29,5,"Great way to use cabbage.  It's just the two of us now, so I always have unused cabbage after making cole slaw.  I fried with yellow summer squash and it was fantastic.  I imagine a little onion next time would also be delicious.  This is going into my permanent addition cookbook.  Thanks, Boxerwing!"
37868,83524,2006-10-18,5,I must rate this high!!! I love cabbage and love butter and this is the way I do it. I gave up the bacon fat. This is really great..thank you for posting. Hugs
373817,83524,2006-12-18,5,Yum!!! Even my two year old loved this cabbage!
35526,83524,2007-01-11,5,Great simple low fat side dish!!!  I used low fat margarine to cut the fat even more.  We loved this!
125640,83524,2007-01-17,5,Delicious and easy too. I minced a clove of garlic and partially cook it before adding the cabbage. I used 1/8 teaspoon black pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt. This is one of those cases where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Even my cabbage hating husband liked this. We both thought it tasted quite a bit like brussel sprouts. Definately a keeper. Thanks.
226863,83524,2007-01-30,5,"This is the way my grandmother taught me to cook cabbage.  She always loved it with pork chops, corn bread, and fresh crowder peas....with homemade fried apple pies for dessert!  But I have found you can adapt this recipe to a lower fat version using Smart Balance spray or Pam to coat the pan.  If it starts to stick, add a little water.  It will still carmelize nicely if stirred occasionally.  Chopped green onions or minced garlic also adds a nice flavor.  This is a wonderful recipe as is....everyone should try it.  I didn't know it as ""frizzled cabbage"", just as plain old fried cabbage. It's always been a staple at my house."
47907,83524,2007-03-06,5,"I have made my cabbage just this way for many, many years.  I love the flavor!  It's very easy to make.  Thanks for posting!!"
377581,83524,2007-07-24,4,Delicious cabbage! Loved the consistency and flavor. I did add some garlic. Thanks for posting! I'll be making this a lot.
307214,83524,2007-10-12,5,The best way to make a head of cabbage disappear!  (I used 2 tbsp butter with 1 small head)
91392,83524,2007-10-30,3,"If I had to eat cabbage, this would be the way to cook it.  I was hoping for something miraculous, and, alas, it is still cabbage, but much better than boiled or anything else I have ever done with it."
64642,83524,2007-11-15,4,Very nice and VERY easy (especially if you use bagged slaw mix).  We both thought it might be nice to use bacon grease instead of butter.
294000,83524,2007-11-18,5,"DH took one bite and said, ""This cabbage is awesome!""  I had never actually cooked cabbage before but have only used it in salads.  This is easy and tastes great.  Thank you.  This will be in our regular rotation from now on!"
520150,83524,2007-12-05,5,I really liked this!  I love lots of veggies my DH won't try.  So I will often make them just for myself.  Having a simple recipe is great. Thank you very much for sharing this lovely recipe that I will make again & again.
359220,83524,2007-12-19,4,"I could eat and eat and eat and eat this all up myself!  Very buttery and sweet.  I've always like cabbage, but have never wanted to bake it like my mom used to when I was a child because I remember it smelling up the house.  This cooking method was easier and quicker, but IMHO, was just as yummy.  I made this for DH to try cabbage and was glad I picked it because he said he would eat this again as well-Success!  Thanks Boxerwing!"
353131,83524,2008-01-15,5,This was so good!!! DH loved it and I thought it was easy and delicious!
499050,83524,2008-01-21,5,Yum!
140132,83524,2008-02-21,4,"Very good.  I made this for dinner last night and my family enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling it.  We loved it ,thank you for posting"
229850,83524,2008-03-25,5,"This was delicious! I never eat cooked cabbage except really in corned beef, or a soup. I thought this was interesting and easy, it was great! The simple ingredients was perfect, what a great tasting side dish !
Thankyou so much"
470351,83524,2008-05-23,4,"I had really high hopes that I would love this dish (since I love raw cabbage) and based upon the reviews I thought I couldn't go wrong....but it was just ""Ok"" to me.  I won't dare rate a recipe based upon my opinion of cabbage because I've never been a cooked cabbage fan.  That being said...I'm rating this based upon my mother's review of it who's a cabbage fiend and she liked it a lot and liked it even reheated the next day.  She thought it was very flavorful and liked the carmelizing of it.  She took the recipe home with her and while she has another recipe for cabbage that she likes a bit more...she feels this is a great change of pace and one she'll make again.  Thanks for posting!"
240552,83524,2008-07-21,5,"Delish! I'm not a fan of cooked cabbage, but this looked interesting and from all the great reviews I thought I would give it a try.  It was wonderful! :D  I used a light butter for it.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
439797,83524,2008-08-06,5,"This was something new to us, but we enjoyed it.  Thanks!"
632249,83524,2008-10-07,4,I was hoping this would get the DH and kids interested in cabbage but it didn't work.  I thought it was pretty good myself but would add onion or garlic next time. Thx.
402559,83524,2008-11-07,5,We love this stuff! I also added some chopped onion and used House Seasoning for the salt and pepper. Thanks for sharing.
369715,83524,2009-01-07,5,Easy and wonderful. I made this for my dinner as no one else in my family eats cabbage. I put the cabbage on my plate and my youngest asked if he could try it. He ended up eating it all and I had to make more. This was so easy to make and very tasty. Loved this and I will be making more often.
158086,83524,2009-03-17,5,This was really really good....we ate it all up...
844554,83524,2009-04-15,5,"I am so glad I tried this one! It's very addicting. Matter of fact, I'm making it for dinner again tonight. I followed recipe exactly except I added quite a bit of pepper to make it spicy. Loved it! P.S. I also added parmesan on top. YUM!"
579298,83524,2009-08-29,5,"I loved this! My husband still isn't convinced that cabbage is tasty though :( So, I cooked the entire head of cabbage, and ate it all myself! Haha :) Thank you for posting Boxerwing."
98919,83524,2009-09-25,5,My husband and I loved this!!  So fast and easy as a bonus to this great recipe.  Thanks for sharing....I predict that I will make this often this winter.
316717,83524,2009-11-25,5,this technique really makes the cabbage sweet. i over did it w/ the butter but it was still good. next time i'll do less.
93006,83524,2010-01-01,5,Have I never reviewed this?  Absolutely delicious - sweet simplicity indeed!
914720,83524,2010-01-11,5,"This was amazing.  I used just 1 T butter for 1/2 cabbage (with some non-stick spray in the pan first), salt and pepper.  It tasted almost decadent, with just that little bit of butter.  I served it as a side to chicken souvlaki, but think it would be wonderful with pork as well.  Thanks so much for posting!"
1122161,83524,2010-02-04,5,"Love it! Fast, easy, delicious! Thanks for posting!"
131021,83524,2010-03-19,5,My Dh and I really enjoyed this. It is so much better than just cooked cabbage. I want to try it with all sorts of other seasonings and an added onion.
298447,83524,2010-03-21,5,"Love, love, love it! I usually use leftover bacon drippings to cook the cabbage in. It's not the most healthy way to prepare this, but it does impart some good ""southern"" flavor nonetheless. Also, I sometimes plate this with a very small dab of sour cream, as my DH likes it this way. FYI: This reminds me of Mrs. Wilkes' Fried Cabbage recipe (found in ""Mrs. Wilkes' Boardinghouse Cookbook""). As a Savannah native, I'd be crazy not to recommend her cookbook or the family-run restaurant (Mrs. Wilkes' Dining Room). If you ever find yourself in Savannah, don't miss it...but get there early, the lines can get long!"
15521,83524,2011-01-28,5,MMMMMMM!  This is such a wonderful way to prepare cabbage!  I used just salt and pepper to season and it was perfect!  Thanks for sharing!
53932,83524,2011-04-23,5,Simple and excellent!  Nicely sweet.
350750,83524,2011-12-04,5,This was AWESOME!   Such an easy recipe too.  Thanks!
227607,83524,2012-01-20,5,Wow!  This was definitely different than any cabbage I have ever had.  I did add a few things to it though.  I followed the directions except sauteed some mushrooms in with it and added a few bacon bits.  Even my picky husband liked it.
39301,83524,2012-05-01,5,"Fabulous!  I'm putting this into my new whole-foods, plant-based recipe recipe cycle.  Thanks for posting!  Healthy tastes good!"
1179225,83524,2012-07-10,5,We love cabbage and this recipe made us love it even more. This would be a great noodle replacement if low-carbing. I'll be making this recipe often. Thanks for posting.
2549237,83524,2013-01-24,4,"We love cabbage and use it in recipes often or as side dishes, but this is probably the best way we've ever eaten it.  Thank you."
191533,83524,2013-12-05,5,"I can now say I like cabbage 2 ways- cole slaw and frizzled!! I made pretty much as directed, and we loved it! Served on the side of pork bbq. It didn&#039;t need 20 mins. on the stove- 10-15 is plenty. I added some carrot ribbons, for color. I think the 2 of us could eat twice this amount, no problem! I love how the cabbage gets sweet..."
1365025,83524,2014-05-01,5,"This is a wonderful basic recipe that you can add things to. I decided to do what one person did: spread cooked white rice on the bottom of a pan, layered the cooked cabbage over it, layered fried slices of kielbasa and then sprinkle shredded mozzarella all over it and put it in the oven until the cheese melted and started to brown a bit. Made for Chef Alphabet Soup."
1072593,83524,2015-04-12,5,"Cabbage helps rhythms of the body. ;-) Ok, now let&#039;s get back to the spirit of cooking.  What&#039;s wrong with ya&#039;ll?"
218535,83524,2018-12-16,3,Only ok. We did not like the taste of the butter
39835,33919,2002-07-23,5,"This casserole is great! It was easy to put together and used ingredients we had in the house.
All four of us had second helpings, with leftovers for lunch.
I did use low-fat versions of the refried beans, shredded cheese, soup, and sour cream to cut down on the fat, and next time I make it I will probably add a green pepper (chopped).
Thanks for this recipe. It is definitely a keeper."
350750,33919,2012-09-01,5,This tasted great and it was so easy to put together.  Thank you!
7108,33919,2002-07-25,5,"Very good, very easy!  I served this with Lipton's Spanish Rice on the side.  Next time, I may add a can of drained diced tomatoes to the casserole; or shredded lettuce and tomatoes and/or salsa on the side for topping.  (I was time limited this time; packing for to-go-to-work dinners).  Very good casserole!"
9869,33919,2002-08-06,4,"I used ground beef for this recipe and cheddar cheese, we found it quite tasty but a little dry.
I'm going to make it again but add a can of chopped tomatoes to the beef/bean mixture."
22015,33919,2002-09-02,4,"This was good.  Next time though, I will reduce the taco seasoning by half.  It wasn't so much that it tasted like it was too spicy as the seasoning was a little bit over powering.  Great recipe though.  We will make it again."
37036,33919,2003-06-23,5,This was awesome!  I made just a few changes to use up ingredients that I had on hand.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom soup.  I also substituted Monterey Jack cheese for Cheddar cheese.  I added a drained can of Ro-Tel tomatoes (as others suggested) to the meat mixture and pickled serrano peppers to the top!  I am definitely adding this recipe to my regulars!  Thanks!
101034,33919,2003-10-21,5,"This truly was one great meal!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, using Taco Seasoning Mix#25449 and Refried Beans#10614. I doubled the taco recipe. It was a big hit in this house. Thanks Nancy"
38643,33919,2004-01-03,2,Didn't really care for the mushroom soup in this recipe.
59163,33919,2004-01-07,4,"I made this last night, we were snowed in.  It was great and so easy to prepare.  I also used cream of chicken and pre-shredded Mexican cheese.  It would also be great with chicken.  Made great leftovers today. Told my husband it was easy enough he could make it. I am trying to convince him to learn how to cook this year!"
93006,33919,2004-10-16,5,"Creamy, yummy, easy...what more can you say?  Definitely a keeper."
91392,33919,2005-02-06,5,"Fantastic.  I read all of the comments and wound up using some extra ground beef with a can of chopped tomatoes mixed in, cream of chicken soup, salsa in the layers and some diced olives in the top layer.  It was not dry, was plenty tasty and everyone loved it.  Now I have to translate it into French and give copies to everyone who came to dinner last night. They had never had anything like it and loved it."
173579,33919,2005-06-17,4,"This was good.  I agree with Mystergirl that the taco seasoning was a little overpowering, at least for our taste.  Will decrease and try again.  Thanks for posting this recipe."
68884,33919,2005-10-03,4,"I thought this was OK. I added a can of Rotel to the meat/bean mixture like others suggested, and I still didn't find it very spicy. Followed the recipe otherwise, using 98% FF cream of mush soup. DH & friends like this a lot; I used almost 3 cups of cheese too. "
185446,33919,2005-10-26,4,"This recipe has its share of high reviews!  Let me add mine.  A cinch to put together, and better yet, everyone in the family ate and liked it. That's all I ask for in a meal.  Thanks, TX Homemaker "
222433,33919,2006-03-02,4,This was a good family recipe! I followed the recipe exactly. Served it with arroz verde and a salad. Thanks TX!
229850,33919,2006-03-28,5,Easy tastey and delicious!Thanx for great recipe.
203325,33919,2006-04-02,5,"This casserole got a thumbs up from my husband who normally does not like casseroles.  It was a nice change and very easy to put together.  I wasn't sure what size casserole dish to use, so  ended up using a 9 inch square baking dish.  I did make more of the soup and sour cream mixture which really gave the casserole a nice creamy texture. "
64934,33919,2006-04-14,5,"Definitely 5 stars!  This casserole was a real winner in our house and it was so easy to prepare.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use a medium salsa in place of the jarred hot sauce, since we don't all like spicy!  I used a blend of Monterey Jack and old cheddar cheese.  This will definitely be a regular on our menu!  Thanks for posting."
125640,33919,2006-06-08,5,"Very Tasty. I used just over 1 lb of ground beef this time, but I think next time I might use a little more meat. I might also try ground elk in this recipe as a way to use it up. Before I went to the store I didn't notice that I was supposed to use a package mix of taco seasoning and I didn't know how much seasoning that was when I started the recipe so I sprinkled in Paul Prudhomme's fajita magic until the meat started to taste moderately spicy and then mixed in another teaspoon after I added the beans. I only had 2 cups of 4 cheese Mexican blend so I also added a cup of mozarella on top. I also used creamy ranchero tomato soup in place of the cream of mushroom. Between the soup and spice we didn't even bother to open up the hot sauce because this dish already had so much flavor. Thanks a bunch. -- posted Jan 13, 2006
The 2nd time I made this I used lower fat beef and it turned out a little dryer, so I'll go back to the higher fat since you drain it off anyway. I used whole wheat tortillas and they worked just great, and used taco cheese which was good, but I think I liked the mozarella a bit better."
37779,33919,2006-07-07,5,"My family and I loved this easy to prepare casserole. I didn't use any hot sauce because of my kids tender mouths and the flavor was still very good. This has that indescribable cheesy, creamy, comfort food yum going on. Thanks TXHomemaker, for posting a recipe that we all enjoyed. "
140132,33919,2006-12-15,4,"I really liked this recipe b/c of the convenience of it.  I always have these ingredients in my pantry and its quick , so perfect for the kids sports nights and time is tight....thank you for a good fast meal.....Stephanie"
377581,33919,2007-01-07,5,I made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful! It was easy to prepare and tasted delicious. Will absolutely make again!
231054,33919,2007-01-28,3,"With so many high, high ratings, this recipe really doesn't need another review.  However, I wasn't real blown away by it.  I did increase the meat (per a couple of the other reviewers).  Maybe I should have stuck with just the one pound. I also wasn't sure on what size of a can of refried beans to use (I'm surprised the recipe wasn't more specific).  I used two of the 15 oz. cans.  I don't think one can would have been enough.  I noticed some of the reviewers also added a can of the Rotel Tomatoes -- that might be a real good idea. I used 6 of the 10"" tortillas -- next time I might try one size smaller.  My casserole dish just seemed a little on the ""dry"" side.  Has anyone else had this happen?"
324621,33919,2007-03-18,3,I needed a simple recipe to fix up for dinner tonight and chose this one because A) I had all the ingredients on hand and B) It had 150 ratings at nearly 5 stars. Unfortunately my family was disappointed with the results. I found it to be just a little too blah despite the fact that I did include a layer of salsa. It was also too mushy for my taste. I will not be making this again. Thanks anyway!
189616,33919,2007-03-26,3,"We found this very salty-read and re-read the ingredients, normally water is added for taco mix/burger. The mixture was very thick, too hard to spread evenly in the casserole pan. The pan size is not added I used 11x-7x"
13796,33919,2007-04-03,5,"This is going into my 'Keeper' file. This needs to be a OAMC. Make it up ahead of time and freeze it in smaller pans. It was so delicious but so rich. I added a cup of hot salsa to the mixture instead of topping with hot sauce. As others stated I used the cream of chicken soup, too. I ate some leftovers for breakfast. Thank you very much for a delicious recipe. It surely does satisfy the cravings for Mexican food."
229524,33919,2007-04-29,5,This is sooooo yummy.  I used the Taco Seasoning Mix (2642) for this recipe and added Texas Petes hot sauce at step 8.  This gave the dish a nice kick to the flavor.  Only used 4 large flour tortillas.  Will be making this often.
97579,33919,2007-05-02,5,"My very picky daughter who only likes food that are 96% sugar, loved this.  She ate 3 helpings.  I only used 4 tortillas and I substituted the following:  fat free refried beans, light sour cream, 2% mexican cheese, ground round beef.  If I figured it correctly, this dish came to 9 pts per serving based on 8 servings for weight watchers.  I didn't have fat free mushroom soup, but next time I will try that and it would change the pts to approx 8 pts per serving.  8 servings is huge and it really is better at 10 servings since this is such a filling meal.  We will definately be making this again.  Thanks!"
499050,33919,2007-07-11,4,Very Good
400420,33919,2007-07-16,4,"I started this dish thinking I had sour cream, but didn't.  I decided to sub a half cup of FF half & half.  I think the sour cream would have provided a better flavor, but the cream made the sauce very creamy and the caserole very moist.  I think the next time I make this I will add a can of Rotel to the mean/bean mixture like other reviewers.  We all thought this was good and I'll be making it again.  Thanks!"
529278,33919,2007-07-21,4,"This was so yummy and easy!  The cream of mushroom soup just didn't seem to ""go"" with it, so we used Campbell's pepperjack cheese soup, as someone suggested, and I think it was a good idea.  Also used a can of chipotle tomatoes to get some veggie in.  Served with a box of Mexican rice (we like La Preferida from the box, not the can). The leftovers were even delicious the next day!"
227607,33919,2007-07-24,5,WOW!!!!! Another wonderful recipe that everyone loved.  These are few and far between in my house.  I did make a few changes though....I used black beans and corn instead of the refried beans and added a can of rotel.  I made a 13x9 dish and it was gone.  Good thing i made an extra one for the freezer.  I will update and let yall know how it comes out from the freezer.  I will make this over and over again.
199020,33919,2007-08-14,5,"Yum! I had to sneak some groceries from my parents to make this, but it was well worth it!  The only change I made was to use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I just thought it sounded better.  Next time I might add more tortillas and top it with green onions, tomatoes, black olives and guacamole.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely be making this again."
280166,33919,2007-09-25,4,"This was a good Monday night dinner!  I used leftover taco meat for the ground beef and stale nacho flavored chips for the tortillas and added a can of mild rotel tomatoes.  I only had poblano creamy soup, so I subbed that too LOL! My picky son had two helpings!  Thanks for posting a quick, easy and tasty recipe!"
74281,33919,2007-11-13,5,"Well, now I know why this recipe has over 200 ratings and is still at 4.5 stars! This dish is GREAT! I used Cream of Chicken soup and added a 4 oz can of chopped green chilies, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Everyone, including my 14 month old identical twin granddaughters loved this meal! This will be a regular in our house for sure!"
371738,33919,2007-11-14,5,5 stars all the way.  So easy to put together.  A very quick meal idea that the whole family will love.  Thank you.
232480,33919,2007-11-15,4,"I didn't much care for this, but dh loved it, which is a rare thing and so you get 4 stars for that.  I used the cheddar cheese as I didn't have any taco cheese on hand, but next time I think I may try it with some monterey jack cheese as well."
486718,33919,2007-12-11,5,Very good. I made as is but will probably add rotel or salsa next time as I had more than a pound of beef and it was a little dry. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!
146486,33919,2008-02-16,5,"WOW!  I made this last week and we loved it!!  This is definitely a keeper recipe.  I doubled the ingredients except for the tortillas and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  I used fat free sour cream, reduced fat cr of mushroom soup, and 2% cheese to make it a little lighter for us.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!"
666723,33919,2008-03-06,5,"I was really excited to try this after reading the reviews!  I'm so glad we did as this is a very easy casserole to put together and it's very delish!  Tastes exactly like a burrito!  I used the ""hot"" taco packet and ""hot"" refried beans to add some heat.  I HIGHLY reccomend using the ""fiesta nacho cheese"" Cambells Soup, which is right next to all the other cream of such and such soups.  This made all the difference and definitely added tons of flavor.  I just couldn't see using mushroom soup in a burrito casserole!  I only used 4 tortillas and it was great because I whipped it up in the morning, put it in the fridge, and popped it in the oven when I got home from work.  Super easy, family friendly, and a keeper for sure!"
426903,33919,2008-05-07,5,"This is a wonderful recipe! I followed the recipe other than a few minor things I added. I used a can on Rotel tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro, I added some monterey jack cheese, and I sprinkled the top with green onions. It was so tasty! I think next time I will like to try another type of soup and see how it turns out. Thanks for this tasty recipe!!"
236170,33919,2008-07-03,5,"I'm rating this without having ever tasted it, only because I made it for my husband and brother and they ate half of it for dinner and the other half for the lunch the next day! It was easy to make and they loved it!"
80998,33919,2008-07-17,5,"We really enjoyed this tonight.  While making it I was concerned because there seemed like ther should be more to it.  I didn't want to change the recipe, so I made as stated.  It was terrific.  Next time I make it I wil make it in a smaller casserole dish (I used a 9 by 13 this time) so there can be more layers.  I also will add some rotel as others have done and see what we think.  I feel like this is a dish you could play with and sitll have great results.  Thanks.  I paired this will simple spanish rice."
158086,33919,2008-09-13,5,This was very good...I will make this for one of our Family Sunday Winter dinner this winter as I think it would go over well.
358796,33919,2008-10-02,4,"Made a healthier version with whole wheat tortillas, turkey, fat-free refried beans, low-fat sour cream, less cheese & low-sodium soup. Easy and tasty."
37868,33919,2008-11-04,4,Great Recipe!!I did not change nothing. However I did not add any hot sauce but think next time I will. So many different things to add to it. I can not wait to make it over and over!!! Thank You!! Hugs
369715,33919,2009-01-28,4,We are in the middle of an ice/snow storm and we were out of electricity. I had a pound of ground beef pulled so decided on this. I followed the recipe exactly as written other then I used a white onion as that is what I had. I also used Recipe #154235 for the taco seasoning packet as I didn't have any and I wasn't running out for any. I also made this on the grill since I didn't have electricity and it came out really well. My kids don't like sour cream but I thought it was hidden enough being mixed with the soup but they still noticed. The recipe doesn't say what size pan to use so I used an 11 x 13 pan. Next time I would use a smaller pan as it didn't fill out the bigger pan. Hubby and I enjoyed this for dinner tonight.
969481,33919,2009-02-27,5,Made this for dinner tonight. Substituted Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup for Cream of Mushroom Soup and substituted a can of diced tomatoes (with Jalepenos) for hot sauce. We will make this again. Thanks for sharing!
44383,33919,2009-03-08,2,Made this exactly as directed.  We were not really impressed in light of all the rave reviews it gets.  I thought there was too much tortilla and the tortilla was a bit rubbery and hard to chew. DH said it was all right but wouldn't miss it if I never made it again.  2 stars for being easy and inexpensive to make.
315055,33919,2009-03-20,5,"Great recipe, thanks so much!  My mom made it for us a few nights ago, she also added a can of diced tomatoes which I think added a lot.  One tip for those that are breastfeeding, this will make your baby very gassy (I'm sure it's the beans) so may want to hold off for a bit.  ;)"
447123,33919,2009-03-30,5,When my daughter saw me making this she said it looked gross and didnt want to eat any of it. Well...... she took one bite and ended up eating 3 helpings!!!! This is a really good casserole. I like how it can be so versatile. TXHomemaker thanks for a great addition to my line up!!
191533,33919,2009-04-17,5,Excellent. I used 4 10-inch tortillas and added 1/2 cup salsa to the meat and bean mixture. It was messy; probably would hold up better when you serve it if made without the extra salsa.
242484,33919,2009-09-09,5,This will be something I will make over & over!  It is just some good cookin' that everyone in the family enjoyed!  I added a can of hot Rotel tomatoes to the beef mixture.
264017,33919,2009-10-13,3,"This was just OK with us. I followed Dissie's advice and added a can of Rotel and green pepper. With these additions, the taste was spiced up rather than being bland. Mine wasn't dry at all, but not the most appealing dish to look at. Quick for a family weeknight meal."
29782,33919,2009-11-22,5,Simply DELICIOUS! recipe. I used Recipe#121415 for the seasoning and made Recipe#44746 for the soup. Added a diced fresh tomato to the meat mixture too. We had a salad along with this casserole.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!!
135887,33919,2009-11-23,4,This was quick and easy.  I made a change by adding a can of Rotel as suggested by others.  So glad I did - I think it would've been too dry if not added.  I wish I could find the Campbells Mexican soup one of the other reviewers mentioned!  I did not add hot sauce but will next time.  It makes a lot.  Our family of five had plenty of leftovers.  I wonder if it would freeze?
43083,33919,2010-02-02,4,This was very easy to make! I used a 9x13 pan but would definitely use a smaller one next time. I really enjoyed the taste and used low carb tortillas. Thanks TXHomemaker!
1581225,33919,2010-05-23,3,"I didn't really enjoy this too much, I didn't like the mushroom soup/sour cream mixture. Another review suggested a pepper jack mexican syle cream soup, that would be much nicer. I also think tomatoes are needed in the beef mixture perhaps in place of half the beans. With those adjustments I may enjoy it much more. Worth a try."
26512,33919,2010-07-12,4,"We all enjoyed this casserole. I used very lean ground round and low fat soup and 2% cheese. I had to sub black beans - I thought I had a can of refried beans, but I didn't. It worked okay, although I think the refried would be better. I used chipotle taco seasoning. The guys really liked this, will make again."
485151,33919,2010-10-14,0,"This was very good and my family enjoyed it. I followed the directions to the ""T"" and was happy with the results.<br/><br/>Made again 10/14/10- once again everyone loved it. After 2 layers I put tortillas & more cheese on top. I think next time I might make 1 1/2 the recipe so I can make 3 layers."
789516,33919,2010-10-30,5,"This was awesome.. tasted like a bean burrito from taco bell, but better!  I mixed a can of diced green chili's in with the sour cream mixture.  Will make this again!"
810787,33919,2010-12-05,5,Creamy and very satisfying. We loved it!
456858,33919,2011-08-21,4,"This recipe was good, just that, just good.  NOT like OMG good.  But, is def easy."
59473,33919,2011-11-21,4,This casserole was really good. I did add some salsa to the ground beef otherwise I thought it would have been too dry. I only used 5 tortillas and just half the package of taco seasoning. I always find the taco seasoning a bit overpowering so it is just personal preference. Thanks I will make this again.
126440,33919,2011-12-06,5,I added hot sauce in the middle of the layers and thought it was great.  Easy casserole and have a little left over for lunch tomorrow even though I made half a recipe.
176615,33919,2012-01-25,5,"The family enjoyed this! Easy, too.  Used 3 cups of cheese, 8 regular-sized tortillas, and a can of organic mushroom soup. Didn't find the dish dry as some have commented. Didn't add salsa or rotel. You could, but definitely not necessary. Thanks for the recipe!"
1179225,33919,2012-08-10,5,"What a quick, tasty and filling dinner. I used ground turkey and added a bell pepper and jalapeno while cooking, used 4 tortillas and added some fresh salsa when layering. I'm looking forward to the leftovers. Thanks for posting."
407007,33919,2013-01-18,4,"This is very different, and very yummy! I used ground turkey and fat free soup/beans. I thought it was really good, but needed a little more ""kick"". Maybe next time I'll try using pepper jack cheese or add some green chiles or sliced jalapenos. I will definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing!"
8688,15242,2002-02-26,3,This recipe cries out for ham.  Either some diced ham in the casserole or to be served with either a baked ham or fried ham steak with Lima beans and some cornbread.  I halved the recipe to serve 4 and cooked an extra long time at a lower temperature after the orginal baking time to make an extra crispy crust on top.
13483,15242,2002-06-06,4,Not much I can say that hasn't been said!!  This was good but mine was a little bit runny.  I used 50 - 50 sour cream and cream cheese.  Also put in some chopped sausage.  It was well received by my guests.
37636,15242,2002-10-14,5,"This is a really great tasting casserole! It may not have tasted exactly like Cracker Barrel's on the nose, it may have been BETTER! I tried a number of tricks from various suggestions with a few tweaks of my own and this was my plan: thaw the shredded-type hash browns, use only 1/4 cup margarine, use cheddar cheese soup, use only half of the sour cream (and I used fat-free), brown the onions first, and use fat-free cheddar cheese. I baked this about 15 minutes longer than called for. This was the most enthusiastic my saughter has ever been for a Zaar recipe! She came back for THIRDS! She loves this, and so does everyone else. Who needs Cracker Barrel? Thanks, Rhonda!"
64934,15242,2003-02-27,5,"Made this tonight as a side dish, but since there is only two of us, I made only half the recipe, and then made up 8 little casseroles (using throw away individual pie plates).  I baked them for only 20 minutes, then froze the rest.  Absolutely delicious!  I used fat free sour cream and light cream of chicken soup, and they were very tasty.  Thank you"
59473,15242,2003-03-25,5,I don't think I can say any more than has already been said. These were terrific. I couldn't stop eating them. I will be making this often.
74652,15242,2003-08-10,4,I have made this a couple of times and its pretty good.  Its not Cracker Barrels recipe but its pretty close.
26512,15242,2004-05-17,5,"This is a delicious casserole dish! I made this for my husband who isn't typically crazy about potatoes and he ate 3 huge helpings! I cooked this at a bit of a higher temp and baked it long enough that it started getting crispy on top. I added some minced onion along with the diced onion. I don't think I added a full pint of sour cream...maybe 3/4 and I didn't realize until this morning that I forgot to put in any butter at all! To be honest, I don't think it needs it, I think it would have been greasy with all the cheese. I served this with grilled T-Bones and corn on the cob and the whole family ate more than one helping. Thanks for posting this, it is a definite keeper for us!"
60992,15242,2005-03-22,5,"Been making this for years! The only yhing we do differently is 15 minutes before baking is done we top it with 2c. lightly crushed cornflakes tossed with 1/4c. melted butter. It is equally good with these substitutions as well. Frozen OBrien potaotes, seasoned salt, and french onion chip dip for the sour cream. My kids favorite cookout recipe! They always ask for the hashbrown stuff!"
53932,15242,2005-03-25,5,Made this exactly as written and it was very good.  It does make a lot so will make just half the recipe next time.
185285,15242,2006-01-29,5,"Instead of writing a review,  I feel like I should be posting a Thank You! DH's first job in college was working at Cracker Barrell, so I was nervous about trying to duplicate the original. I only had a mix of Cheddar and Monterry jack cheeses, had to use fresh, grated potato and low fat sour cream. Even with the adjustments, DH said it was 'better than cracker barrell! Thank you so much for a great recipe!
"
37868,15242,2006-07-24,4,"This was so very good. Everyone of you are right.
It is easy and fast to make. Now that we have ate it we are wishing we would have put some ham it.
No matter I am sure it will be good both ways.
Thank You"
222433,15242,2006-08-23,5,"It is easy and delicious! I usually make a similar recipe, but have to cook to potatos. Using the hashbrowns is so much easier! I agree that ham would be a fantastic addition! Thanks Rhonda!"
39301,15242,2006-08-27,5,Yum!  Very close to Cracker Barrel's recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.
262312,15242,2006-10-22,5,"I have made this recipe for years!  I omit the butter, sub cream of mushroom for chicken, and add garlic.  I will often add cooked and crumbled breakfast sausage and bacon when I'm wanting to make this a one-dish meal!"
146486,15242,2007-01-15,5,This is soooo good!!  I accidentally left out the salt and pepper but it wasn't missed.  I used fat free sour cream and 2% cheddar and omitted the butter.  We all loved it and will be having it again!!!
119466,15242,2007-04-11,4,"This is a staple with the Easter ham around these parts. I prefer it with shredded hash browns (easier to mix if they are thawed), sharp cheddar, little or no butter, and half the sour cream called for. They're simple, but always enjoyed--thanks for posting!"
402559,15242,2007-05-18,5,"We really liked these. I used only 1 pound of hashbrowns though because we like ours saucy and I used all reduced fat stuff. Will make again, thanks!"
125640,15242,2007-12-06,4,"The first time I made this I made it exactly as directed, and I don't know how it compares to Cracker Barrel's as I've never had theirs, but the flavor was just okay. It was easy amd very creamy, but the sour cream flavor was overpowering and there wasn't much flavor otherwise. This time I subbed cream of mushroom for the cream of chichen and used the whole can of soup even though I halved the recipe; I cut the sour cream back to 3 oz to accommodate the extra soup. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese and a clove of pressed garlic for personal preference, and about 2 ounces of cubed ham to make it a one-dish meal. It was really good this time. Thanks for sharing."
140132,15242,2008-01-19,4,This was good.  I made it last night to go with our pork chops and it was enjoyed by all.  Thank you for posting....STephanie
407007,15242,2008-12-22,5,"This is delish! It's not exactly like Cracker Barrel's, but it's close like you say. I think it might be EVEN better. I used light sour cream and fat free condensed soup to lighten it up a bit. I found it actually tasted better as leftovers after it had chilled and been reheated... I couldn't stop eating it then. ;) Thanks so much for sharing this recipe - it's a keeper!"
43083,15242,2008-04-20,4,I made this for a breakfast thing at work and the pan was almost gone by the end of the day! Thanks for a very easy recipe!
121185,15242,2008-04-21,2,Hmmmm....I've never had the real thing so I can't compare.  But we really didn't care for this..
386849,15242,2008-06-24,5,"Wonderfully yummy!   mixed all ingredients except butter together, then poured the melted the butter over the top just before baking.  I find that the top gets a nice golden brown color by doing it this way.  Mine did take about 1 hour to cook. Thanks!"
218535,15242,2008-07-30,1,My family did not like this. Too much sour cream.
111291,15242,2008-09-23,0,"Yum!  I have been making different variations of this recipe for years.  This one is very good; however, I cooked the onions with a bit of butter before baking the casserole and then mixed everything together with the exception of one cup of cheese-which I put on top. Thanks for posting!"
54678,15242,2008-10-05,5,My family really enjoyed this. I didn't have sour cream so I used cottage cheese and a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also sauteed my onions in the butter to soften then mixed everything together before putting in pan.
264017,15242,2008-12-26,5,"As the 167th outstanding review, I need to back up what most everyone else says about this fabulous recipe. LOVE IT! I cut the ingredients in half and it was swallowed up in no time. I used Healthy Request soup and fat free sour cream, plus reduced fat cheese. No one knew the difference. We will enjoy this again and again. Thanks Rhonda!"
38643,15242,2008-12-26,5,Even though I forgot the butter it still tastes like Cracker Barrel's casserole and is definately worthy of five stars.
579298,15242,2009-08-22,5,"Yum!! I think this is BETTER than Cracker Barrel's :D I did alter the ingredients a tad - I used 1 cup of plain yogurt instead of 2 cups of sour cream, used 1 whole medium onion, and I used unsalted butter (Smart Balance 50/50). Next time I plan on halving or even omitting the amount of butter. Very decadent, thank you for sharing!"
879716,15242,2009-12-09,5,This did taste just like Cracker Barrel's.  I didn't have frozen hash browns so I shredded up some potatoes and pan fried them a little to get some moisture out of them.  The casserole didn't set up as solid as the one from the restaurant and that could be the fault of my fresh potatoes.  Next time I will probably cut back on the butter a bit and add an egg into the mix to bind it together a bit.  It made a lot so there's plenty left over for tomorrow's breakfast.  Thanks for this yummy recipe!
1133190,15242,2010-09-26,5,"This was a hit! I had to bake it for more like 55 min. before it was done. The only substitution I made was to use 1 c. monterey jack cheese as I realized I was almost out of cheddar.  I really liked having the onion in here, my old recipe didn't call for it but I think it's better with.  Add chopped ham to make it a meal. Thanks for posting!"
1365025,15242,2010-10-22,4,This was quite good. I thawed the hash browns before using and I mixed everything together except the cheese really well and then I stir in the cheese. This made it a lot easier to stir everything together. At first I thought there was too much butter but then I realized this kept the casserole from sticking to the dish and also browned up the top really nice. Even through supper was hours ago I keep going back to the kitchen for samples. It's only room temperature now but even tastes better now that it had a chance for all the flavors to meld together. Next time I will make this up in the morning to give it time to meld together and then bake it just before supper.
1052873,15242,2013-01-01,5,"Used 2 boxes of the dried hashbrowns (looks like a 1 pint milk carton), reconstituted, 1 cup sour cream. dried onions and the rest the same. On the stove 1/2 hour, 375 15 minutes because I was using the oven for the meat. Excellent."
126440,15242,2014-02-09,5,So good.  Had two baked potatoes to use and added about 1/2 c. soup and sour cream.  No butter but cheese on top.  YUM.
2549237,15242,2016-10-26,4,"I have made this recipe several times now. The first time that I made it we thought it was a bit soggy, so I cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons after that and the hashbrowns have come out great and to our liking. I follow the recipe besides the butter precisely and these always come out great and get gobbled right up. I made them again tonight for our weekly &quot;Brinner&quot; (Breakfast for Dinner) and they were a hit as usual. Thank you for a great staple in our house!"
1581225,15242,2017-04-22,5,"I made it mostly as directed, except I used tater tots. That's because you can't get frozen shredded hash brown potatoes in Australian supermarkets and I didn't want to spend the time shredding, rinsing and par-cooking fresh potatoes. It turned out very well though, I really loved the flavour. It was maybe a little salty, so next time I won't add salt, but I will make it again."
119466,236170,2007-07-12,5,"Tasty cookies, especially considering the few ingredients and little effort involved. I scaled the recipe to half to use up some sweetened condensed milk left over from another recipe and baked the cookies on parchment paper. (The sweetened condensed milk was fat free and worked fine.) Thanks for posting!"
33159,236170,2007-10-10,5,"Wow!  I'll definitely be adding these to my Christmas goodie trays this year!!  So, very easy to make & so tasty - rich & creamy.  I couldn't find mini M&M baking bits so I just used regular sized M&M candy (without peanuts) & they worked fine.  It's very easy to tell when the cookies are done - they look wet while cooking but once they are done, it is obvious as they look dry.  It was a little bit tricky getting the cookies off the baking sheet but by taking my time, the cookies stayed intact."
199792,236170,2007-12-16,5,"Mmmm, my son and I couldn't stay out of these so off to the freezer they went! I don't think mine looked as pretty as Gayla's photo but they tasted fine. I made them quite small as I want to add them to small 'samplers' to give to my colleagues. They will really brighten up the little plates. Thanks so much for posting your recipe. I will let you know how they held up with freezing."
37036,22176,2002-04-12,5,"Thanks for the great recipe!  I only had a 26 oz. jar of spaghetti sauce on hand, so I decreased the chicken broth to 1/2 cup, and it was wonderful!  My husband loved it and told me I need to make it again... so it's a keeper!"
232480,22176,2005-12-19,4,"Followed this recipe exactly.  Not our favorite, but certainly passable.  Might make again, increasing the garlic by quite a lot as we love garlic!"
64583,22176,2003-01-23,5,Great recipe - my whole family enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.
42720,22176,2003-05-26,5,"Very delicious recipe!!  The only changes I made was that I used a tablespoon of chopped fresh oregano leaves from my herb garden and I used ""Italian Blend"" cheese because it is what I had on hand.  For those who haven't tried it, it is a blend of mozzarella, parmesan, provolone, romano and two others I can't remember.  It worked great!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
"
44383,22176,2003-10-10,4,"Made this exactly as listed except I couldn't find Ziti in my supermarket so I used Rigatoni instead.  This recipe was okay but it wasn't anything special imho.  Hubby thought it was just okay too.  We had it with crusty bread only so maybe a salad or some other side might have made it more special however, I probably won't make it again."
76951,22176,2004-04-25,5,I thought this was very good.  It does make a large batch therefore we had leftovers for several days.  I definitely will make again (the kids LOVED it!).
7108,22176,2004-04-25,5,"Very good!  I cooked this on a spur of the moment and used 16 oz of small lasagna noodles, which is what I had on hand.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  I served with garlic bread and a tossed salad.  Thanks for posting!"
68884,22176,2004-06-08,4,"This is really good, and easy. I used 4 cups of my homemade sauce, and a 5-cheese ""Italian blend"" instead of mozzarella, but  otherwise followed exactly. It *fills up* a 13x9 dish for sure. We had 6 for dinner, and had 4 servings leftover. (good reheated, but kinda dry so I added more sauce when I reheated). Served with salad,  French bread with SaraFish's Delicious Cheese Spread #18914 and a good merlot. Thanks!"
64203,22176,2005-03-30,5,"This was delicious and so easy! I wanted to make Ziti bake, but didn't have any ricotta and 99% of the Ziti recipes call for Ricotta. We all really enjoyed this. The only thing I did differently was to half the recipe and I used ground Italian Sausage because I had some I wanted to use up. Delicious recipe! Thank you very much for posting it!"
64934,22176,2005-05-03,5,"This baked zita was excellent!  I cut the recipe in half since there's only two of us, and we still have enough left for another meal!  I probably had a bit more sauce than I needed, but it was delicious!  This will definitely be a regular item on our menu.  Thanks for sharing Caryn!"
173579,22176,2005-08-11,5,This was the best Ziti recipe that I have found.  I liked all the parmesan cheese that it had in it.  Very flavorful.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for posting.
222055,22176,2005-08-19,5,Simply wonderful. The only difference that I made was I had a bigger jar of sauce (45 oz). and 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef because that's what dh brought home. It ended up being the perfect amount for the 16 oz. of pasta. We are very pleased and will definetly be having this again.
229850,22176,2006-10-06,5,"This was very simple and easy, made it as written, but I do have to say, I agree, if time permits, I will try it with homemade sauce, think it would be even better. But for an easy quick meal, this can't be beat. Thanx"
51011,22176,2006-10-07,5,"This is so easy to throw together!  I  can not believe I have yet to review it.  I agree, that usually I like to use my own sauce, but on those busy nights, jarred is good too. I also like to add some basil.  Thanks for sharing!"
269331,22176,2006-10-12,5,"Iâ€™ve made quite a few baked Ziti dishes; this one is by far the best!  I used ground turkey and sautÃ©ed it with fennel seeds (makes it taste more like sausage).   Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  YUMMMM!"
180090,22176,2007-02-06,5,"This was a delicious dinner! I followed exactly, except used 26 oz spaghetti sauce. It had a great flavor, almost tasted like sausage instead of ground beef. My picky BF loved it and I will be making this easy recipe often, thanks!"
111291,22176,2007-03-21,5,"YUM! What more can be said after 68 reviews? Made as posted and used homemade spaghetti sauce (Recipe #1211; ""Spaghetti Sauce to Die For"").  Delicious! Thanks for a keeper!"
29782,22176,2007-08-06,4,Easy and simple to come together. DH and I enjoyed it.  Since it was just us two I halved the recipe and still was plenty lefted over for tomorrow's dinner :)   Thanks for sharing the recipe.
125640,22176,2008-01-19,5,Very easy to put together and delicious. I added a can of mushrooms but followed the recipe exactly other than that. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks.
135887,22176,2008-03-12,3,"I won't add the chicken broth next time as it made it somewhat watery.  Other than that, easy and filling."
377581,22176,2008-06-11,5,"This was easy to prepare, and yummy! I used ground turkey. Next time I'll serve it with some garlic bread. My family really liked this! Thank you for posting!"
318235,22176,2008-11-06,4,This was great for my weekly pasta night. Very easy and could easily have been made ahead. The only thing I didn't like was that the chicken broth watered down the sauce too much.
439797,22176,2009-01-29,4,This is a great recipe to have in the freezer.  I used plan old Ragu and my kids liked it.  Real comfort food.
485151,22176,2009-02-11,5,"Absolutely loved this! Everyone in the family did. It's so easy to make, yet it looks great too. I think this will be one of the meals I make when I have guests. Variances from the directions: My spaghetti sauce was only a 26 oz can and I was worried that wouldn't be enough sauce. So I added a can of italian diced tomatoes (juice & all) in with it. In place of the chicken broth, I put 1 cup of water and 1 tsp of chicken boullion granules in with the sauce. Baked according to directions and it came out great! It does make a lot though- next time I think I will divide it into 2 smaller dishes and freeze half for another meal later."
315055,22176,2009-09-23,4,"This was a good, heary meal.  I added some salt and that seemed to bring the flavor out a bit, it was a little bland.  I also added some sharp cheddar on top to add flavor, and that helped as well.  I think I would add a lot of veggies next time to bring out the flavor...though the casserole dish was overflowing, so I don't know where I would put them!"
229524,22176,2010-05-13,5,"This was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!  Loved that it was easy to make.  Did put one cup Asiago cheese  on the top.......we love this cheese!!!!!!  Added the Asiago before placing in the oven for 20 minutes...didn't read the part about putting the cheese on after baking 20 minutes.  When I realized my mistake I just sprayed the silver foil with some olive oil spray, this keep the cheese from sticking.  Removed the foil after 20 minutes and put it back in the oven for the final 10 minutes.  Highly recommend  this recipe.  You won't be sorry."
1269015,22176,2011-01-27,0,"I scaled it down to 2 servings and baked in an 8x8 dish and still had enough for 4 people. I swapped out the meat for olives (being a vegetarian) and used pizza cheese and sauce. It was okay, definitely a recipe I can build a good vegetarian version from. Thanks for sharing."
175824,22176,2018-07-30,5,Yummy. Easy to make. Thanks for posting.
37779,22176,2011-06-01,5,"It has been said before, this is great comfort food. I omitted the chicken broth, because we like a thick sauce. Worked out well. Very easy to put together and had great result. Thanks."
369715,22176,2011-06-14,5,This was easy to make and wonderful tasting. I followed the recipe as written and we all loved it. Hubby said it could have used some pepper though so next time I would add that to the sauce. This makes a lot and it was just as good as leftovers the next day.
218535,22176,2018-09-16,3,This is only ok
1052873,22176,2011-09-20,5,"Usually I try to follow the recipe at least the first time but I had to work with what I had... 1.5 lbs frozen ground beef, dried onion flakes, 1 26 oz jar Newman's own roasted garlic spaghetti sauce, one cup generic traditional sauce, 1 cup water, 1 tsp chicken bouillon, dried powdered oregano, 2 cups frozen shredded Mozzarella, 3/4 cup cottage cheese, 1/2 cup parmesan and 3 small eggs (we always have too many eggs - I try to put eggs in everything). Mixed all the cheeses together, forgot to save some for the top, and didn't have any more. Noodles, cheese, sauce, noodle, cheese sauce. Definitely a keeper, although the kids like the pepperoni one better."
191533,22176,2012-06-04,4,"Very yum, although I prefer my pasta casseroles with a little more sauce."
203111,22176,2015-07-11,4,"This was quite good.  I used penne instead of ziti and made my own sauce.  There is no amount given for the mozzarella.  Near as I can tell, you need 3 cups."
68460,65340,2003-11-16,5,"I absolutely agree with the previous reviews - these are the best rolls I've ever made and the easiest yeast roll as well.  I was 'test-driving' recipes for Thanksgiving and this one made the grade.  Tonight I cut the recipe in half, on THE DAY I'll be making the full recipe and I can't wait for everyone's reaction to these excellent rolls.  Thanks jean, for the terrific, easy, tasty recipe!"
64203,65340,2004-11-24,5,"I love baking bread, but I especially love baking bread that is this easy to put together and tastes so good! If you are looking for a dinner roll recipe that will knock the socks off of your guests, this one is it. So simple and so delicious!
Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
Kristen"
168462,65340,2005-10-17,5,Very good and easy. I only had a bit of butter so I added Crisco to make up the required amount. They still turned out very good. Next time I will make sure I have the butter. Thanks for the recipe.
278113,65340,2006-02-27,5,These rolls were FABULOUS!!! My son and hubby both raved. We will be making these over and over..thanks bunches!!
145352,65340,2006-02-28,5,"I've made these TWICE in the last 2 days!!! The first time we had unexpected guests right when they were coming out of the oven, so I set them on the table with butter as a sort of appetizer! They were gone in minutes. I didn't get to try them! So the next night I made them for dinner...perfect and so easy! I got about 24 rolls. "
40961,65340,2006-03-15,5,I made these rolls tonight and they were a huge hit.  I baked them at 350 for 14 minutes and they were perfect. Easy and delicious. thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.
52125,65340,2006-04-26,5,These rolls are truly wonderful and quick and easy to fix. Thanks Jean....
8629,65340,2006-04-29,5,These were very easy to make. They turned out picture perfect. I brushed the top of the rolls with melted butter when they came out of the oven.
50969,65340,2006-05-25,5,"i've never made homemade rolls before,because i was afraid of yeast.but not anymore thanks to this recipe.i put in the ingredients according to my breadmaker,and let it do it's thing.about 20 minutes before the machine stopped i warmed up my oven to about 100 degrees,right before i started to form the rolls, i turned off the heat.placed the formed and covered dough in the oven for about 20 minutes.removed cover and baked at 350Âº as other posters have done, in my oven they took about 20 minutes.i buttered the tops and could barely wait for them to cool off enough to eat.the taste was just so incredible.thank you so much for posting such a great recipe.if i can make these anyone can.these will be made again and again."
55578,65340,2006-07-28,5,Absolutely wonderful!  DS ate three before he even sat down at the kitchen table.  I will be making these gems again and again!
333017,65340,2007-01-01,4,"Now, these were truly excellent!  Instead of 24 buns, I made up 18 an placed them in 2 8 x 8 pans.  This recipe can be cut in half for smaller dinner party"
203111,65340,2007-02-24,5,"I have died and gone to heaven!!! These rolls are fantastic! Soft, fluffy, light, buttery and my grandkids are going to go nuts when they taste them. The only things I changed were that I used non-dairy creamer in place of milk and baked them at 350F for 22 min. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!
Forgot to mention, I let mine rise for about 1 1/2 hours."
29782,65340,2007-10-02,5,Fantastic recipe! The rolls turned out perfect. Next time I think I may add melted butter to the pan while rising and baking to give it more of a buttery taste. Although these were delicious the way they are. :) Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!
28649,65340,2007-12-02,5,These rolls were awesome.  I made them for thanksgiving and there were no leftovers.  This is a recipe I will use again and again.  They are simple to make and taste like they took all day to make.
13796,65340,2007-12-23,5,"Very Delicious rolls.. and a beautiful dough to work with!
Certainly a keeper. Thanks jean."
402559,65340,2008-01-16,5,"Didn't change a thing and they were great, thanks!"
125640,65340,2008-01-29,4,Tasty and very easy. I used 1/4 whole wheat flour for the extra fiber and nutrition. I halved the recipe and baked at 350F for 15 minutes. Worked very well. Thanks for sharing. I will be making these again.
232480,65340,2008-02-09,5,"These are absolutely fabulous rolls. When they were mixing the dough looked a little wet, but rather than adding more flour I just took a chance and left them alone. I'm glad I did - they worked out beautifully! I shaped into 24 rolls and proofed them in the oven since the house was pretty cool today. Baked 15 minutes at 350, which was perfect for them. Soft, fluffy, buttery...dh raved about these. They will be made often here!  UPDATE 2/9/08: Two years later I'm still making these rolls.  I often either drop them into muffin tins or divide each of the 24 dough balls into thirds and make cloverleaf rolls.  The dough is really SO easy to work with and versatile!"
394077,65340,2008-02-10,4,"I find that when I used all bread flour, the dough gets too dry and the rolls come out on the chewy side. So, I mixed 2 cups of AP flour and 2 cups of bread flour together. The result is soft, light and fluffy rolls. I also baked these at 350 for 17 minutes."
377581,65340,2008-07-18,5,"Yum Yum Yum! I did everything as written. I brushed the rolls with melted butter when I took them out of the oven. These were great! Light and fluffy, delicious rolls! Definitely a very good fool-proof recipe. Thank you."
37305,65340,2008-10-01,4,"These rolls have a velvetty texture that I really liked, but they lacked a bit in the flavor department.  I had one with just butter and it was very bland.  I used salted butter and the correct amount of salt in the recipe, but I'm wondering if increasing the salt would bring out the flavor a bit.  I just expected more out of a recipe with an entire stick of butter in it.  That said, used as sandwich or burger buns I think they're super.  Just not a stand alone roll, IMO.  Thanks!"
54678,65340,2008-10-19,5,"Chef Chill made these rolls to go with the fantastic steak, shrimp and caesar salad using all zaar recipes. These were wonderful and a great accompaniment to a fabulous meal. Thank you Chill"
37036,65340,2008-11-28,5,Great rolls!  I followed the suggestion of a few other reviewers and allowed the rolls to rise for almost an hour.  The flavor and texture were great!  Thank you Jean for posting!
353131,65340,2008-11-29,5,"I have a great refrigerator roll recipe that I have made for years. I decided to try these to make good use of my time because I was cooking the dinner for our extended family this year. This was so simple and they looked so good. We took them out of the oven and buttered the tops and I had to sample. I could've skipped the remainder of the meal and eaten these only. My BIL said,"" wow! who made these rolls,they are awesome."" Everyone raved and I hated to admit how simple they were. This will be my ONLY recipe for rolls from now on."
499050,65340,2009-01-06,4,Very Good.
937635,65340,2009-11-10,5,"Great rolls! I love the buttery flavor and you don't even need to add butter on top of the roll to curb your butter ""fix"". I used 3 3/4 cups of flour and 1/4 cup of flaxseed. Let them rise for an hour and a half or so and baked for 13 minutes. Wonderful rolls! I will definitely be making again."
808027,65340,2010-01-03,5,YUM!!!  Will definitely make these again...and again...and again!  They brown so nicely and are so soft and fluffy.  Effortless in that everything goes in the bread machine...and yet they taste like you went to a great deal of effort.  Thanks for sharing!
47559,65340,2010-07-21,5,Lovely yeasty rolls.  Among the best I've ever had.  The only thing I might try next time is to let them rise a little longer before going into the oven.
637486,65340,2010-11-24,5,"These are just great!  I have made these a few times now, although with different results.  The first time I followed the recipe and the rolls were too dark on top, a little doughy, and they didn't rise much.  The second time I thought I would try whole wheat flour, and that was just a flop because they didn't rise at all, so they were small dense lumps!  The third time I was able to perfect the recipe.  I stuck with the bread flour but let them rise 1-2 hours and then followed the other reviews and lowered the oven temp to 350 degrees and baked for 15 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe, it will be a huge hit at Thanksgiving this year!"
176615,65340,2010-12-31,5,"Excellent rolls! I make a lot of yeast rolls and these were fantastic. Light, wonderful flavor, and the dough is very easy to work with. Only change I made was to use regular unbleached flour with the addition of 2 T vital wheat gluten (I stopped buying bread flour years ago). Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
928301,65340,2011-08-10,5,"Very good.  I don't know if I'll crave them, but I know I had trouble not eating more of them. Light and fluffy.  I wouldn't call them buttery though.  I don't know where that title came from.  I even rubbed butter on them after taking them out of the oven and they still didn't strike me as buttery."
383346,65340,2012-03-19,5,They are so easy to do.  Easy to roll into balls.  They were great out of the oven with butter.  Thanks jean :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
199020,65340,2012-11-11,5,"UPDATE: I've made so many great dinner roll recipes, I couldn't remember which one was the best. THIS IS IT! Made them again for an early Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone agreed. It doesn't get any better than this!<br/><br/>Amazing rolls! 200  five-star ratings can't be wrong! We will definitely be making these again! Thanks!"
894666,65340,2015-03-04,5,"Baked at 350 for 25 minutes. Really soft and delicious, the kids ate a whole pan of them! Thanks for this super easy recipe!"
264017,65340,2016-11-23,5,"Absolutely wonderful recipe! I made these today for tomorrow's Thanksgiving meal. The dough had risen so high in the bread machine, that it stuck to the lid! No problem as it came right down upon taking it out of the pan. I made 20 larger rolls rather than 24. Thank you!"
101823,108522,2005-02-19,5,"Great simple grilled cheese.  I didn't taste a noticeable difference in using mayo instead of butter.  I came away with crispy, toasted bread and gooey melted cheese.  It is the perfect sandwich for tomato soup."
29782,108522,2005-02-22,5,"Great grilled cheese! I never knew thats how diner's made them.
I seen this recipe while viewing a topic yesterday morning. It has been on my mind ever since so I decided to make me one this morning for breakfast.  Yum!! is the word. Nice toasty brown grill cheese, Dawnab! Thanks for sharing it. "
132764,108522,2005-02-25,5,"No one noticed that I did this. I did though, because it was sooo much easier to spread than butter or margarine! Thanks for the wonderful tip!"
60989,108522,2005-03-06,5,What can I add that hasn't already been said? This does make the bread brown evenly; it is MUCH simplier to prepare and it does taste great! I will not go back to butter again. Thanks!
36944,108522,2005-03-09,5,"A new way to fix a grilled cheese that is easy to spread on the bread and results in a very crisp and browned outside with a creamy, melted, cheesy inside.  Thanks for sharing your recipe dawnab!"
8688,108522,2005-03-13,5,"""Mayo on grilled cheese?"" ""Never!"", I said. I had never heard of this technique before until now. When I saw your recipe, like others, I had to try it right away. Crispy brown and beautiful! This makes a lovely sandwich : ). I used a mild cheddar and just a touch of sugar on the inside, like I always make my grilled cheese sandwiches. Thanks for sharing this, Dawn! "
64934,108522,2005-03-14,5,"After reading all the wonderful reviews for this recipe, I just HAD to try it!  Like so many others, I would never have thought of putting mayo on instead of butter, but I was truly amazed at the end result.  The sandwich was wonderful and this is how I'll be preparing all my grilled cheese sandwiches in future!  Thanks for sharing, Dawn!"
56087,108522,2005-03-18,5,"I to am NO mayo fan, but this was easy and fast.  No waiting for butter to soften.  AND no real taste of mayo.  I'm actually going to try it with Miracle whip.. gross I know..  thanks for the quick easy recipe."
35526,108522,2005-03-19,5,This works perfectly.  I made a turkey and cheese sandwich on whole wheat and made it this way and it was fantastic!!
176615,108522,2005-03-21,5,"What a wonderful and easy idea! Makes a crispy sandwich, nicely browned, in no time! I tried this with lowfat mayo but much prefer it with full fat mayo. They brown quickly so watch out! Thanks Dawnab, I'll use this method often!"
64203,108522,2005-03-22,5,"I tried this today to see what all the rave was about and it was so tasty! I can't believe that changing from butter to mayo makes such a difference in a sandwhich, but it does. It spreads so nicely and browns perfectly. The flavor is very subtle, but you can tell the difference! Thanks for posting this delicious and easy recipe. My kids enjoyed their sandwhich, and I even added pepperoni to one for an added twist. Tasty!"
68460,108522,2005-03-23,5,"Came home from a long road trip today totally ravenous and needed something FAST.  I made this in minutes and loved it! I never thought to use mayo like this but it really works so well....nice brown crust on my homemade white bread.  I had to use 3 slices of cheese because my bread slices were so big.  I'll be making grilled cheese sandwiches like this from now on.  Thanks Dawnab, winner/keeper recipe and so simple :)"
51011,108522,2005-03-24,5,"I honestly do not like mayo either, but decided to give this a try for breakfast this morning.  Only change I made was to use mild cheddar instead of sliced cheese.  Thanks so much for sharing! Super simple and tasty!!!"
53932,108522,2005-03-26,5,Add me to the list of converts!  Who knew a grilled cheese sandwich could be any better?  The bread was evenly and nicely toasted and the mayo added a bit of flavor.  This is the only way I will ever make grilled cheese from now on.  Thanks for sharing!
91392,108522,2005-03-27,5,"Everyone should know about this little trick.  No taste difference that I could see, but, boy, was it easier!  And I spread on the smallest amount I could get on there, really scraped that mayo across the bread because I don't like it,  and it still made a beautiful grilled cheese."
172369,108522,2005-03-30,5,"Had to try this and  loved it. My son didn't want his with mayo, so I made both and the ones with mayo looked and tasted better. I would have never thought it. Thank you for sharing."
124190,108522,2005-04-03,5,"Easy as can be! You don't taste the mayo at all. And I agree, they do cook faster. They have a lovely golden color and are very crispy. I used light mayo with no problems."
95743,108522,2005-04-11,5,"Yep, this is the default grilled cheese recipe from now on.  As others have noted, it doesn't change the taste, just spreads easily and grills up beautifully."
182624,108522,2005-04-20,5,"Awesome!  I'll definitely make my grilled sandwiches this way from now on.  Mayo is definitely easier to spread than butter, and comes out just as brown and crispy if not better.  I just finished my sandwich, to which I added a thin layer of cream cheese, some diced jalapeno and cheddar instead of American.  I also like to put a cover on the pan while it's grilling; it melts the filling completely that way.  Yum!  Thanks!"
103876,108522,2005-05-14,5,The kids really enjoyed this.  The mayonnaise spreads so much easier than butter so they can make it themselves.  Neat idea!
140806,108522,2005-05-16,4,"I personally don't understand what all the hype is about...The outsides turn a nice crispy brown but IMHO it lacks in flavor and gets a little too greasy. I plan on using this recipe again, but only when I have a very sharp cheddar. "
9869,108522,2005-05-21,5,"I just felt like a grilled cheese sandwich for dinner and as I was on my own tonight it was the perfect opportunity to make this recipe.
I only had lite mayonnaise (Best Foods) and didnt have any problem with the bread browning or crisping..I used cheddar cheese and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner..thanks for sharing."
88099,108522,2005-05-29,5,"Okay, I hooked on the Mayo thing.  What a great idea.  It browned so nicely and was very crisp, just like I like them.  I made mine with the mayo and DH's with butter and he could really tell a difference in the crispness of the bread.  Thanks so much."
37036,108522,2005-06-02,4,"The mayo browned nicely, but I could definitely taste the mayo.  I love mayo, but it just didn't seem right on grilled cheese and I feel it made the grilled cheese more salty.  I think I'll stick to margarine or butter for my grilled cheese, but I enjoyed giving the recipe a try.
"
160974,108522,2005-06-04,3," I was curious about this recipe, although we are very partial to the traditional buttered sandwich. It seemes like if your turn too early or pan temp isn't right, it sticks to the pan than with cooked with butter. For my second sandwich I reverted to butter and both my husband and I preferred the buttery taste. Congratulations on being the number one recipe for so long!

Roxygirl in Colo."
132383,108522,2005-06-06,5,"I tried this and really, really like it.  I was skeptical and I can't get any of my friends to try it, but it is a keeper.  Thanks!"
74652,108522,2005-06-17,4,I had to re-review this recipe because I came home from lunch today and wanted a Grilled Cheese but we were out of butter.  So I made it with mayo again and decided it was very quick and easy and they brown up nicely!  Tasted good too!  :)
126104,108522,2005-07-13,0,"This came out smooth, crisp and evenly browned.  I think I'm just one of those folks who prefers that greasy, oooooozing butter grilled cheese."
43083,108522,2005-08-28,4,"Wow, this was easy! I also wondered how mayo would work out on a grilled cheese sammich and I found out. I still like the fattening, buttery taste of a grilled cheese made the ""old"" way but this will be kept in my lunch cookbook anyways! Thanks:)"
50969,108522,2005-10-31,5,"i tried this on October 26th,2005 and i'm so sorry i haven't rated before now.the mayo gave it a wonderful evenly browned crust.instead of using regular cheese, i used a slice of swiss with a slice of boneless ham.it was very good.thank you for posting."
180090,108522,2005-11-30,5,I tried this tonight and it turned out great! I will always make grilled cheese like this now. Thanks for the insider trick for grilled cheese!
18391,108522,2005-12-02,5,I don't know how I forgot to review this .. This is excellent and so easy to make .. I make my sandwiches this way all the time now .. thanks!
37449,108522,2005-12-04,5,"I am tickled to be the 100th reviewer of this simple, yet very yummy sandwich! The mayo makes the difference!"
175824,108522,2005-12-11,5,"These came out perfect. I will never make grilled cheese any other way. I put a nice slice of tomato on top of the cheese. How yummy. Next time I plan to add a couple slices of bacon.
Thanks Dawnab for sharing.
"
59780,108522,2005-12-19,5,"How can 110 reviews be wrong?! Great recipe and it was a perfect addition to Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper Soup Recipe #145074. Thanks for sharing :)
"
278113,108522,2006-01-03,5,"I cannot believe what a difference a little mayo makes!! My kids gobbled these up and asked for more! Thanks for sharing your secret, we will never go back to butter."
149363,108522,2006-01-23,5,"Delicious and easy way to make grilled cheese, I will never go back to my ""old"" way again!
Thanks for posting!"
55578,108522,2006-01-30,5,Yummy!  I added thinly sliced onions.  Definately make them again!
229850,108522,2006-02-20,5,"Never heard of using mayo before was curious. It was great. Glad you put the tip in there about not using Miracle Whip, normally I would have used that. Thanx for a new idea."
68960,108522,2006-05-04,5,Another fan here.  These are great.  I took jilkat25 advise and microwaved for 30 seconds before I cooked to ensure the cheese was melted.  Added tomato to Daves.
218535,108522,2006-05-08,5,Very good idea to use mayo. DELICIOUS.
251917,108522,2006-05-10,5,YUM-O!! Who would have thunk it? I used muenster cheese on mine - melts better and practically oozes out of the sandwich! AWESOME!
52125,108522,2006-06-18,5,"I have been wanting to try this recipe for some time now and Im so glad I did. I used Hellmans Mayo and it really is outstanding and the taste is really yummy! I will make my grilled cheese sandwiches like this from now on,yumm! Thanks for posting a keeper Dawnab...."
402559,108522,2006-12-28,5,"VERY IMPRESSIVE! Thanks for sharing a great tip, this is the only way we will make our grilled sandwiches from now on."
222970,108522,2007-02-10,4,This turns out very nicely and does look like a commercial sandwich. I've had teenage boys eat these by the dozens. One warning: don't use reduced fat mayo! It looked very peculiar this time around; save the low fat mayo for salads! I sometimes also add a slice of deli ham.
44383,108522,2007-03-13,1,These were the worse sandwiches I've ever tried.  No one mentioned how the bread sticks to a (non-stick) fryer making it impossible to turn sandwich without it pulling apart.  We threw our soggy torn up sandwiches out and I will never try this one again.  I'll stick to the buttered version. Sorry it just didn't work for us.
49304,108522,2007-03-14,5,Fabulous grilled cheese sandwiches. Love using the mayo instead of butter. Have made them several times I got the recipe someplace else. Thank you for posting it on Zaar.
255338,108522,2007-03-14,5,"It was amiss of me to forget to review this recipe after having used this one countless times. I cannot thank you enough for revealing the secret to grilled cheese sandwiches. We love it, and there was not sticking whatsoever. Thank you so much for sharing."
140132,108522,2007-04-15,4,I made this for lunch one day and my DS thought I was crazy for putting the mayo on the outside...lol.  But when he tasted it he loved it.  We will do this again as it made a very beautifully golden sandwich that tasted just as good as it looked....Stephanie
125640,108522,2007-05-19,4,"I've tried this with both regular and dijon mayo and a couple different kinds of cheese. Regular mayo tastes different than made with butter, but not like mayo; it's pretty good. Dijon mayo gets a weird mayo flavor that's not very nice. Flavored mayo did brown nicer than regular though, regular tends to burn around the edges in the 3 minute cook time. American cheese works, but to us the tase and texture of nearly any other kind of cheese is better in this. Thanks for sharing."
357358,108522,2007-06-01,5,"We loved these. No more greasy grilled cheese sandwiches in this house. I thought the mayo might add an odd flavor, but it didn't. The first time I have ever had such evenly grilled sandwiches! Thanks so much."
207176,108522,2007-06-07,5,"I have a confession to make: I did use mayo on whole wheat bread and then I put a little butter in the pan (force of habit). It was delicious but I will make them again with just the mayo to really experience the ""mayo difference."" :)OK:  Made it exactly as stated with a bit of cooking spray and it was great and even added ham for some."
265954,108522,2007-07-10,3,"Maybe mayo just skeeves me too much, but I wasn't crazy about this method of cooking a grilled cheese.  I'd stick to using a butter spread, or just toast the grilled cheese sandwich in the toaster oven with no butter on the bread.  Thanks for posting."
377581,108522,2007-11-30,3,This is pretty good but I'll probably stick to butter instead of mayo. Beware the mayo cooks fast. At medium low heat mine burned in less than 3 minutes.
386849,108522,2007-12-09,2,"Great texture, but you cant beat the taste of real butter. I may use this again in a pinch, but butter is my #1!"
358796,108522,2008-03-05,5,This is how my Gramma makes it. I like the mayo much better than using butter.
242484,108522,2008-04-05,5,I can't believe I just found this awesome recipe!  It works great!
470351,108522,2008-08-24,5,God I love this site!  It's recipes like this that give the tricks of the trade that the average cook would never have figured out.  I'm not the best grilled cheese maker (I'm the person who always cooked on a super high setting causing the bread to burn but the cheese not to melt) but have been trying to be patient since my kids really like them for lunch.  I came across this and had to give it a try.  WOW!  PERFECTLY crisp on the outside and ooey gooey on the inside.  The bread was so perfectly crisp that I was even able to slice the sandwich with a triangle shaped sandwich cutter (the kids like it that way) without all the filling coming out.  As I pushed through the bread I just heard the perfect crunch as it pushed right through.  It was great!  Will ALWAYS make mine like this from now on.  I used low-fat Hellman's and it worked perfectly!  Thank you for this one!  Excellent tip for us novice grilled cheese makers!
189475,108522,2009-01-31,5,"I can't believe I forgot to review this. I first made this a few years ago and I've been making my grilled cheese this way ever since. Everyone I make it for agrees that it is a lot better this way. To make it even better, I still butter the frying pan so my sandwiches have mayo and butter. Not very healthy, but it tastes great. Thanks for an excellent idea!"
369715,108522,2009-02-23,4,"I made these tonight for dinner and no one even noticed I used mayo instead of butter. I followed the recipe as written other then I used 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich. I loved how the mayo was easier to spread then butter is. I thought these got darker quicker then when I use butter so next time I would watch them a bit closer as they were a bit dark for me. I just like them lightly toasted. I did think they were crispier then a regular grilled cheese, which I really liked. I will be making these again! Thanks for the recipe."
844554,108522,2009-04-20,5,I must admit I did use low fat mayo since that's all I buy but I wanted to try this recipe anyway. It still tasted very good. I did have to spray my skillet with Pam butter spray but it was alot healthier for us than the normal grilled cheese with all that butter. Will make again. Thanks.
333017,108522,2009-08-10,5,"I have to, also admit....I used low fat mayo as that is all I use.  The grilled cheese sandwich had a very definately unique taste to it and the only problem what that it disappeared way to fast.  Yummers served with Barbecue sauce!!!!"
195589,108522,2010-04-20,5,"Well, I see I only put in the stars and didn't write anything here back in 2008. LOL We LOVE these, make them all the time now, the mayo is pure genius! Thanks for posting Dawnab."
305531,108522,2010-04-28,5,"Yum! Not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said, lol. This was great! Simple, fast, true comfort. Thanks Dawnab. Made for I Recommend Tag."
1506604,108522,2010-06-26,3,"Nice. I don't know if I prefer a butter or mayo grilled cheese. Next time I'll make it with butter and see which is better. It has a bit of an aftertaste (like a slight freezer burn), so it may not be the mayo's fault."
2549237,108522,2014-03-05,4,These sandwiches are good and I agree that the mayonnaise is easier to work with than butter.  I missed the butter flavor that grilled cheese usually has.  This will be good for my son when I need a quick lunch for him.  Thanks for something different tonight Dawnab.
32058,32614,2003-03-22,5,"Oh these are GOOD, GOOD, GOOD!  I added 1/2 a bag of semi sweet choc chips to these and they just melt in your mouth.  These look as well as they taste.  TY!"
42720,32614,2003-05-09,5,"Well, add my name to the list of people who liked this recipe! I made 10 dozen of these cookies for Easter.  Followed your recipe exactly then plopped a jelly bean on top of each dough ball and pressed it in, slightly.  They came out of the oven just perfectly festive for the holiday.  Thanks for sharing!
  "
64934,32614,2003-08-28,5,"Great recipe, Karen!  I used Duncan Hines double chocolate chip to make these and reduced the oil just slightly since the cake mix had pudding in the mix.  They are delicious!  Can't wait to try them again using a different cake mix!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
26512,32614,2003-12-19,5,"Okay, like you need another review for these wonderful creations, right? Absolutely the easiest cookie I've ever made and the BEST chocolate cookie I've ever made! I was so impressed with these, I was dancing 'round the kitchen!
I made these cookies along with some chocolate chip and chocolate dipped butter cookies to go in my Christmas trays. I'm going to be a popular girl this year, K! Hugs and thanks for a new family favorite - it just doesn't get much tastier or easier than this!"
218535,32614,2005-07-13,5,Great cookie. Taste just like the ones I used to get from Cornell University's campus dining. Brought me back to my younger days. THANK YOU!
50969,32614,2005-10-03,5,"OH!!! karen=^..^=, thank you so much for such an easy and delicious cookie.i never thought about using a cake mix for cookies. this is going to be definitely a repeat at my home. and it will be on my cookie trays this christmas.thank you so much for posting."
173579,32614,2005-12-06,4,These were just ok.  I'm going to try them with some other cake mixes.  Thanks for posting.
125640,32614,2005-12-12,4,"I would give it another star, but for as fool proof as they looked I still managed to ruin the whole devil's food cake batch (something to do with not estimating what an inch looked like very well or not really understanding what was meant by 'just set' or the altitude or something). At any rate they came out tasting like overly sweet charcoal (even the ones that didn't burn) and got thrown out. But I tried again with a spice cake mix and played with the time and temperature a bit and found that, if I used as close as I could get to a teaspoon of dough, after 15 minutes at 350°F I got about 45 sweet, gingery cookies that were crunchy on the outside and slightly chewy inside. They went rather nicely with coffee."
89831,32614,2005-12-13,5,"The first time I made these I made them with regular chocolate cake mix, they were just okay, but lacking in flavor, I didn't want to rate them making them with a different ingredient, I wanted to wait until I made them with a Devil's Food mix. I just made them again with a Devil's food cake mix, I reduced the oil a bit and added in mini chocolate chips, and WOW what an extreme difference! For a cookie recipe with only 3 ingredients, I am impressed, and I will make them again, thanks for posting this super-easy cookie recipe Karen!....Kitten:)"
222433,32614,2006-03-26,4,Definitely very quick and easy! My kids like them. Great when you short on time.
55578,32614,2006-06-28,5,"Saw this on a thread of the last cookies we made.  Saw this and made them  DS really liked these, said they 'melt in your mouth'.  I found an old box of spice cake mix and DS ate all the apple sauce, so used oil.  Turned out great!!"
229524,32614,2006-12-09,5,"Super delicious cookies.  My husband says these are his favorite cookie now.  Love the Fudge taste, and it doesn't get much easier.  I live in Colorado so I added 2 tablespoons of flour.  Already bought 2 more boxes of cake mix .  I send the recipe to my  college  daughter  so she could make them for her Christmas party she is having."
389431,32614,2006-12-16,5,"Oh My!!!
I just made my first batch of these and they were WONDERFUL!!
My husband and I are going to a Christmas party tonight so I thought I would bring some treats... these are PERFECT!! I made this batch with Classic White Cake Mix and then mixed in those Nestles swirled morsels in red and green...  They look so festive and taste AMAZING!!  Next I'm trying it with Chocolate mix and mint extract as well as Red Velvet!!
Thank you Thank you Thank you for such a quick and FABULOUS recipe!!!  I will be making these over and over!!"
394077,32614,2006-12-20,5,Very good and so easy.  My family loves it.  My daughter usually hates chocolate but she loves these cookies.  Wish all recipes were this easy and tastes this great.  Thank you for posting it.  Any other great recipes like this would definitely be appreciated by busy moms like me.  My cookies didn't come out puffy like the ones in the picture above though.  It was flatter and the powder sugar didn't show up.  Any idea why?
230557,32614,2006-12-23,5,"My husband, oldest son, and neighborhood kids fell in love with these!  The 1st batch is already gone and the requests for more are rolling in.  Thanks! - Updating: I've made more, this time using only 1/3C oil, and adding 1/2C mini chips & 1/2C chopped walnuts - an even bigger hit!  I also didn't roll them - just used my medium cookie scoop & dusted with sugar after baking when they were on the wire rack (very easy & they still 'crinkled').  I love the versatility of these."
182624,32614,2007-01-08,4,"Really easy and good.  I increased the oil to 3/4 cup based on another reviewers suggestion since the dough was super thick, but I think next time I'll try it without the increase.  I found I had to bake them 11 minutes or more before they were done.  I dusted them with a little extra powdered sugar after they cooled a bit for a better presentation.  But these are great little cookies - almost like little brownies!  Tasty and easy to prepare.  Thanks for a great recipe."
140806,32614,2007-01-12,5,"How couldn't I give these five stars? They are easy, tasty, and they perform a magic disappearing act! My aunt commented that she loved them because they aren't too poofy, and every little bite is heaven. I can't say I disagree! I had a little bit of a problem getting the powdered sugar not to absorb into the dough, so I just sprinkled extra on after baking."
74652,32614,2007-01-14,4,DH loved these and he is the all time Cookie Monster!  I always have these ingredients on hand and they were so easy to make. I did not add the Vanilla as I didn't think they needed it. A great Chocolate fix when you are craving it!  This is a keeper!
316717,32614,2007-02-16,5,i used phillsbury devil's food cake mix. so darn easy to make and really good.
377581,32614,2007-03-30,5,"Tasty and goes together very quickly and so easily. My family loved these and I will definitely be making them again. Thank you, for a great recipe."
252816,32614,2007-04-12,5,"I have made cake box cookies before but,I can not say enough good things about this recipe. Easy recipe.It did not need the vanilla...These cookies were so fudgy,almost decandent.Nice an chewy.We just loved them..My DH who really isnt a chocolate lover, ate most of these cookies himself..I will be making these alot...Thank U for this recxipe."
359220,32614,2007-12-09,4,Super easy and very tasty.  I'm glad I added these chocolate chewies on my cookie trays this year!  My only problem was I had a hard time getting the powdered sugar to stay on.  Still tasty and will make again.  Thanks Karen!
189616,32614,2007-12-18,5,"My cookies didn't look as nice as the photo! My cookies were flat. I did go by -JL- recommendation and added 3/4 c. oil, perhaps that is why.. Went with strawberry cake mix, and they are liked by all."
353131,32614,2007-12-19,4,"Made these cookies as indicated. Mine came out flat and the powdered sugar had almost completely been absorbed but, that didn't affect the taste these little gems are wonderful!"
185926,32614,2007-12-20,5,"OH MY these are easy and good. I made some while waiting for dinner to finish cooking. We had them for desert and I had to stop myself after 4. I used two teaspoons to scoop out the dough and roll them in the confectioner's sugar. I made them pretty big and had to flatten them out a little on the pan. I like a flatter looking cookie. I got about 24 cookies from the batch. They taste light and chewy. Like a brownie/cookie. Yummy. Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe. I've also used the spiced cake mix, adding 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoons each of nutmeg and ginger, then rolled in cinnamon sugar, and bake as directed.  Yummy.  Everyone at my X-mas party raved about them and the house smelled wonderful."
140132,32614,2008-01-20,5,"My mom used to make these.  I don't know if this is her same recipe, but these taste just like them.  Thank you for the recipe that I can share with my kids....Stephanie"
74281,32614,2008-12-20,5,These are the best cookies ever! I loved the update hints that you posted Chef #37305 because following those really made these cookies turn into beautiful delicious little masterpieces! And so easy to throw together you can always have great cookies on the spur of the moment!
121185,32614,2009-01-07,5,SO easy - and the kids love to help make these.  Quick and easy chocolate fix.
180090,32614,2009-01-07,5,"So easy and so good. I had a difficult time at first figuring out the baking time, it was a little more than 10 minutes, maybe about 12. My first batch came out a little too doughy, so I think it's a good idea not to make them too big so they bake faster. My husband loved these so much, he was sad he couldn't eat more since I was making them for Christmas cookie trays. I will be making them again though, thank you Karen!"
199020,32614,2009-01-20,5,"Oh my...I could easily eat the entire batch of these at once.  They are easily some of THE BEST cookies I have ever had!  And, they're done in less than 15 minutes - start to finish.  I made mine with lemon cake mix, and they are divine!  I can't wait to try other flavors!  Thank you so much for the recipe!  This one is going straight to my favorites collection."
808027,32614,2009-12-16,5,These are great and SO EASY.  A new addition to my Christmas cookie platter from now on.  My kids loved these.
371738,32614,2010-10-04,5,"I thought I had already rated these, as I have made them twice now.  Easy, quick recipe.  I roll my cookie balls into a sandwich bag with powdered sugar to get it to stick better.  Works great.  Tasty, ""fudgey"" recipe that yields A LOT!!"
15521,32614,2010-10-18,4,"Very good, easy recipe that is handy because I had all the necessary ingredients right there on hand.  The only thing I didn't like was the oiliness of the cookie.  Next time I might substitute applesauce for part of the oil and see if that helps.  The taste is wonderful!"
222055,32614,2011-09-21,0,This has got to be my favorite chocolate cookie ever. If you use lemon add a little zest to it.
55729,32614,2011-12-11,3,"I had a box of cake mix left over from a product test that I never finished (oops!) and needed cookies more then a cake, so I gravitated toward this recipe. It was very easy and they turned out well. I tried to let these dry so the sugar would not absorb, but was only partially successful because I got impatient. I took mine out of the oven after 8 minutes. They probably could have gone longer, but they are still chewy so I think I like them this way."
810787,32614,2011-12-14,5,"I am going to a cookie exchange at work tomorrow and needed something to throw together fast. This was super easy, and I like the taste! I used a small ice cream scoop to scoop the dough. I scooped them out and dumped them in a bowl of powdered sugar. I rolled the dough around, generously coating them. They turned out perfect."
456858,32614,2013-02-28,4,"These were good.....might make again.  Shared w/ ladies N the office, they enjoyed them so much, they requested the recipe :)"
203111,32614,2013-07-29,5,"Really delicious cookies!  My 11 yr old granddaughter and I made these over the weekend and used Betty Crocker dark chocolate cake mix.  Actually, she made them, I just assisted.  It was nice that we didn&#039;t need a lot of ingredients, and that she could mix it all with a spoon rather than having to dig out the mixer.  I helped her roll them into balls and then in the powdered sugar since that was a bit time consuming.  We got 2  large trays of cookies, totaling about 36 cookies.  Ours came out rather flat so next time I&#039;ll try making them a bit larger.  Also, most of the powdered sugar disappeared, so next time I&#039;ll do as Karen suggested and let them &quot;dry&quot; a bit before rolling them.  Nevertheless, they were chewy and SO delicious!"
928301,32614,2013-07-30,1,"I really didn&#039;t like these at all.  The one thing I did like was the way they were just one step away from using ready made cookie dough.  Aside from that--too fluffy, not sweet, salty flavor and the cooking time needed maybe another 5 minutes."
489552,32614,2013-12-17,0,"Oh my goodness....I can&#039;t believe this is happening.  I just finish making these cookies 2 hours ago, and they are hard as rock!  I made them for a potluck my Grandson is having in school tomorrow, and I have wasted time and produce.  I now have to resort to crackers and cheese cuz I have no time to do anything else.  I am so disappointed!"
242484,32614,2014-03-29,5,It just doesn&#039;t get much easier than this...and with such a great cookie to boost!
2549237,32614,2014-03-30,0,Super easy and surprisingly delicious!  I had no idea that something with only 4 ingredients would come out so deliciously.  I made this as a quick dessert to serve at a church luncheon and they were gone almost instantly and I had to share the recipe with quite a few of the other ladies.  Thanks for a delicious easy dessert Karen=^..^=!
1581225,32614,2016-11-19,5,"These are delicious! Especially when fresh out of the oven. The description is correct, they are chewy and fudgy. I found I needed to chill the dough. This helped keep the cookies from flattening too much, as the dough was very wet and didn't hold its shape at room temp. I also rolled the balls, coated them in as much powder sugar as possible and dumped them straight onto the tray, no flattening. They spread enough on their own. The best thing is they are so quick and easy to make."
198154,32614,2016-12-09,5,"Making cookies for a Christmas party cookie swap tonight. First recipe was a major fail, tasted good but looked horrible. Now I am short on time and still in need of cookies for tonight. So glad I came across this. I had everything on hand. They were quick and easy to throw together and baked up beautifully. They taste good, too! Next time I may try the adjustments that were posted in another review based on a recipe on the side of the cake mix box as my mix was just a tad on the greasy side. Thanks for saving the day!"
158086,34382,2007-11-26,5,made these for thanksgiving and they ate them all up....so I am assuming that they were a hit!
47559,34382,2002-09-15,5,I tried this recipe with the thin skinned golden potatoes.  It was absolutely wonderful. I added a little more milk because I think these goldens were starchier and drier than the red potatoes but they were so pretty and buttery looking.  The flavor was just right; neither the garlic nor the parmesan were overpowering.  DH said that we can make these instead of the old mashed potatoes from now on.
37636,34382,2002-10-23,5,"These were wonderful! They were very easy to prepare and finished in no time at all. I did double the garlic on mine (Is there such a thing as too much garlic???), and they tasted great. You have an absolutely fabulous dish here, Inez! Thanks!"
22015,34382,2002-11-04,5,My mom & I fixed this to go with a leg of lamb and it was a real hit.  Great way to have potatos without gravy.
29014,34382,2002-12-09,5,"I know this recipe has alot of reviews, but it deserves to be famous!  This was so simple & soooo good, I could make a meal of it!  I didn't change a thing except to partially peel the potatoes (husband gets freaky about the skins!)
I am going to make this for Xmas dinner - definitely a keeper (and I just used plain, old store bought reds)!
Thanks, Inez!"
8688,34382,2003-04-01,5,"Inez, I never tried making red potatoes into mashed before, and I am so glad I finally did!  Your recipe is wonderful, and so are you, my dear!  So easy to prepare and so tasty to boot! Dan gives you two thumbs up!! ;).  Thanks, once again, Nezz, for appearing once again with a wonderful dish for our table!"
32772,34382,2003-04-02,5,Gourmet potatoes made easy. I made a few changes to the original recipe. I didn't cook the garlic with the potatoes but melted in with the garlic and then added the garlic butter to the mashed potatoes for more of a robust flavor. I also added 3 ounces of fat-free cream cheese which makes the potatoes creamer. Served these with MizzNezz Garlic Green Beans and Yopers' To Die For Pot Roast. What a fantastic meal.
51011,34382,2003-08-06,5,"YUMMM YUMMM YUMMMM!!!!

These potatoes were quick, easy, and ohhhh so yummy!! i followed the recipe exactly- except i added a bit of onion at the end with the cheese.  these went perfectly with my dh's birthday feast! thanks so much for sharing- we will be having these again soon."
7108,34382,2003-08-06,5,"Very good; this was one of my first times making real mashed potatoes.  I forgot to add the garlic to the potatoes when boiling, but added jarred minced garlic while mashing.  Next time I will add fresh garlic to the water for more garlic flavor.  Still, very tasty potatoes, thanks Inez!"
74652,34382,2003-08-24,5,Wow!  These were fabulous!  I did like the other reviewer and served with Salmon. Perfect together. Thanks!
64934,34382,2003-09-02,5,Absolutely delicious!!  Made these for supper last night to go with Bev's meat loaf. The only change I made was to throw an extra clove of garlic in. These potatoes were fantastic and I certainly will be making them again!  Thanks for sharing!
95743,34382,2003-11-25,5,Delicous and much simpler to make than some other mashed garlic-potato recipes. Skipped the butter and didn't miss it a bit. Doubled the garlic.
26512,34382,2003-12-26,5,"Wow!! I served these potatoes along with your Peppery Beef Tenderloin. I seared the tenderloin in a pan and then deglazed with Merlot and used to make a brown sauce to serve over the potatoes. My son who hates gravy, raved about these mashed potatoes and gravy! Thanks, MizzNezz...we had a fabulous Cmas dinner!"
37036,34382,2004-05-14,5,"Great flavored potatoes!  I've never used red potatoes for mashed potatoes before, but I loved them!  They had just the right amount of garlic and cheese.  I'm so glad I finally gave this recipe a try.  My DH said they tasted just like the ones his mother used to make!  Thanks for sharing another wonderful recipe! "
37449,34382,2004-11-06,5,"I was going to make these exactly as stated, but at the last minute my DH told me he hates cheese in his mashed potatoes, so I left out the parmesan cheese, but it was great without it. Thanks Inez. I will make it with the cheese sometime just for me."
64203,34382,2004-12-19,5,"These are so tasty and delicious! I've always struggled with mashed potatos for some reason, but this is a flawless and simple to make recipe. For our dinner party this evening, I had to give this recipe to everyone! They all loved it!
Thanks for sharing this delicious dish!
Kristen"
60260,34382,2004-12-22,4,These were very good a nice change from russets.  I did add more milk and butter because I wanted them a bit creamier - the texture is a bit stiffer then a russet.  I liked the parmesan cheese - and added a bit more of that so the flavor of the cheese was more prominent.  They stand alone well and don't need gravy.
188119,34382,2005-05-15,5,"wow this was pretty good.  Very easy! I think I might have added a bit more parmesan and some pepper, but other than that this was really good!"
33159,34382,2005-11-05,5,"Oh my goodness!!  Even though there are only two of us, I still made the whole recipe anticipating leftovers - and I was NOT wrong!  I loved everything about this recipe - the amazing flavour, the unique texture, the smell, how interesting it looked on the plate...  Thanks for sharing this one!"
36944,34382,2006-07-12,5,"This was a fast and easy way to prepare creamy garlicky mashed potatoes and the parmesan was an added bonus!  I used home grown red potatoes, peeled, and doubled the garlic.  I topped it off with fresh ground black pepper.  A really flavorful low fat side dish.  Thanks MizzNezz for a delicious healthy vegetable dish!"
140806,34382,2006-09-13,5,This is really tasty and so simple. I reduced the recipe to how many potatoes I had. The only other change was to use a little bit of the cooking water to add with the milk. I know I will be making these again soon.
227607,34382,2006-10-04,5,YUMMY!!! The only change I made was to use half and half instead of milk.  Everyone loved them.
358796,34382,2006-10-15,5,"Awesome, simple mashed potatoes. Next time I'll cut back the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and double the garlic cloves. Can't go wrong with this recipe."
229524,34382,2006-12-09,5,LOVED these potatoes.  They get 10 STARS from us.  The flavor is fantastic.  Thanks for another super recipe MizzNezz.
180090,34382,2007-01-15,5,WOW! These were some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had! The texture and flavor were sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly. I'm very impressed with how little butter is used and that they still taste so yummy. This is one of my new favorite recipes. Thank you MizzNezz!!
8629,34382,2007-01-20,5,"These are excellent.  Due to a dietary restriction, I needed to peel the potatoes but that didn't seem to hurt the recipe at all.  I needed to add about an extra half cup of milk in order to get the consistency I wanted. Also, I warmed the milk before adding it to the potatoes.  Great flavor."
142335,34382,2007-02-07,5,I can't stop making these! With or without gravy they are still terrific. I just made them again last night;)
324621,34382,2007-03-28,5,"Great! Served this to the kids for lunch along with mini meatloaves and peas & carrots. They didn't like these too well, but I thought they were very good! I had a bag of potatoes needing to be used up which is why I decided to make these. But all I had on hand was minced garlic in a jar, and I wouldn't recommend that substitute.  Also, when it came time to add the cheese I realized I only had 1/8 cup parmesan. Soooo...I expect that these would be much better if I have all the cheese and fresh garlic on hand the next time I make these! I also added probably another 1/2 cup of milk, because they were just too dry for my liking with just the 1/2 cup stated."
262312,34382,2007-04-06,5,"I can't believe I forgot to rate these!  I made these on Valentine's Day and just fell in love with them, as did DH!  I really like the idea of adding the garlic with the potatoes and mashing them all together, it's so easy and flavorful.  I'm not sure how I never thought of that!  Anyway, thanks for yet another keeper MizzNezz!!!!!  Oh yeah, I added a teaspoon of black pepper."
140132,34382,2007-04-13,5,"Oh wow!!!  I have just recently been introduced to garlic mashed potatoes and I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to the original...lol. I saw your recipe and liked the idea of the parmesan cheese with the garlic.  I was right, it was delicious, even DH who doesn't like parmesan cheese had seconds of this.  This is really very good and I will use this recipe over and over again....thank you.....Stephanie"
240552,34382,2007-04-18,5,"These were great!  I used crushed garlic as that is what I had, so I needed to add a little more later.  Thank you for the great recipe!"
248023,34382,2007-04-22,5,"Delicious!!!  Not gummy, or sticky like you will find with some mashed potato recipes.  I made it exactly as written... except I did add some kosher salt to the water with the potatoes and garlic. Simple and oh so good!  Perfect side dish when you are craving some creamy potatoes!  Thanks for sharing!"
362983,34382,2007-06-07,5,I love these mashed potatoes! I used russet potatoes and they worked out perfectly. I added some green onions as well as some mozzarella (no parm on hand) and it was great! I made a ton and I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow. Thank you!
185446,34382,2007-06-14,5,"While the potatoes boiled, the kitchen reeked of garlic.  I was afraid garlic might overpower the end product.  Not to worry--a wonderful subtleness to them, and with the parmesan, they tasted delicious!  I especially liked pieces of peel throughout; very attractive.  This is a simple dish that would compliment company fare.  Thanks, MizzNezz!"
182624,34382,2007-07-13,4,"Great potatoes.  Just the right amount of cheese and milk, although next time I'll add a bit more butter and an extra clove or two of garlic since we could barely taste it.  I also have to have a bit of freshly ground pepper, but that's just personal taste.  I'll definitely make these again, thanks!!"
103876,34382,2007-08-20,5,"These potatoes were perfect!  I love how the garlic is cooked with the potatoes and then mashed together - very simple!  I peeled the potatoes, used just 1/2 tsp of salt and a little more milk than was called for to get a creamy texture.  The flavor was right on.  I'm sure I will make these again.  Thanks for posting."
357358,34382,2007-11-18,5,Delicious and easy to make! Comfort food at its best. Next time I might try cheddar cheese for a different twist. Thanks!
187281,34382,2007-11-23,5,"Boiling the potatoes with the garlic is genius, MizzNezz! Worked like a charm! Perfect garlic flavor throughout! For Thanksgiving, I left out the parmasan cheese to better fit the meal. Thanks!"
386849,34382,2007-11-24,4,My mom made these for Thanksgiving and we thought they were great. Thanks!
137911,34382,2007-11-25,5,"I have made these twice over the past couple of months and didn't realize I forgot to rate it.  This recipe is so delicious and easy for mashed potatoes.  Red potatoes seem to boil up faster than the brown so I prefer to use them.  Plus, you can eat the skin and there's no time wasted peeling.  Thanks for this keeper MizzNezz."
579298,34382,2007-12-02,4,"This is poster child recipe for easy and delicious. Per personal preference I doubled both the amount of garlic as well as the cheese. I used a Parmesan, Romano and Asiago grated blend. YYYYUUUUMMMMM!"
199020,34382,2007-12-03,4,"This recipe appealed to me because I hate to peel potatoes!  It was really good, but I have to say I prefer to use the Yukon golds.  I added lots of extra butter and more milk.  Thanks for sharing."
125640,34382,2007-12-18,5,"The first time I made these, I made them as directed. They were a little bland on their own, but good with the sauce from Recipe #12458 on top. I thought the Parmesan was a nice touch for both the flavor and the texture and was just the right amount. I also liked the method. It was very easy and turned out much better than some more labor intensive versions of garlic mashed potatoes I've tried in the past. I've served them on their own a couple of times since and they're just perfect for us adding an extra tbsp butter, 2 extra cloves of garlic, extra 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper. Thanks very much."
774665,34382,2008-03-16,5,These were fantastic and went really well with beef because of the parmesan cheese. I'll come back to this recipe again and again.
377581,34382,2008-06-29,5,These were great tasting potatoes! I love the parmesan. It adds just the right touch making the potatoes something special. I served this as a side-dish to grilled steaks. Great meal. Worthy of company! Thanks for posting!!
937635,34382,2008-09-13,5,Excellent recipe WARNING : DO NOT DOULBE THE SALT!!!! I took that advice from a comment and it was AWFUL. My partner is still making fun of me four days later... otherwise great recipe
879716,34382,2008-09-20,5,The best mashed potatoes I have ever made!  I hesitated to add the parmesan because I wasn't sure if I would like it - but the parmesan absolutely made the dish.  Only change I made was to use evaporated milk instead of regular milk because it adds a great richness.  Yum!
46660,34382,2008-10-28,5,"I can't believe I forgot to rate these! I made them last week. I am going to start by saying I do not like red potatoes. I usually think they taste like dirt. However, I had received a fair amount of them in my produce co-op, so I had to find something to do with them. I came across this recipe. I did everything according to the directions, and I loved them! I even had enough left over to top a shepherd's pie with the next day. You have changed my mind about red potatoes! Thank you!"
242484,34382,2008-11-04,4,Really enjoyed these...nice flavor!
847160,34382,2008-12-04,4,good
53932,34382,2008-12-13,5,Very good.  I used more garlic and parmesan because I love both.
620763,34382,2008-12-20,4,These were good and very easy to make. I used peeled Yukon gold potatoes instead of the red.
394077,34382,2009-02-15,5,"Excellent with ""Honey Ginger Grilled Salmon #13982"" by Mirj. Thank you."
280166,34382,2009-04-14,5,LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I'm hoping my picky kids don't like it so there will be more for us!  I also added a healthy dollop of chived flavored cream cheese.  YUMMEE! Thanks for posting!
529278,34382,2009-05-21,5,"Easy and delicious!  I put in 5 garlic cloves (2 of them were small) and it was just the right amount of garlicky.  Also used 1 more tablespoon of butter.  It had plenty of flavor.  As a personal preference, I will use more milk next time.   They were rather stiff, but still delicious!"
914720,34382,2009-09-22,5,"These were amazing!  We loved the flavor, and I loved that I didn't have to peel the potatoes.  Served as a side dish to recipe#286594 -- will become a frequently used recipe at our house.  Thanks for sharing!"
142367,34382,2009-10-08,4,"These were good, but we found they needed much more milk and butter than indicated in the recipe.  Also, I think I would add more garlic.  Thank you for sharing."
426903,34382,2010-01-10,5,I had never made mashed potatoes from red potatoes. These were very tasty! Thanks for posting
1133190,34382,2010-02-16,5,"Great potatoes! This is basically what I have always done.  Putting the garlic in with the potatoes as they are boiling was new for me though.  I also use sour cream, and sometimes cream cheese as well."
315055,34382,2010-04-21,3,"There was too much milk in this, which is unfortunate because I wasn't willing to make a whole new batch of potatoes to correct it."
439797,34382,2010-06-13,5,Just got fresh potatoes from the Farmers Market.  These mashed potatoes are fabulous!  We ate every single bite in one sitting.
1506604,34382,2010-07-23,5,"Yum Yum YUM!!!! SO good and so easy. Barely needs any salt though. Just perfect as it is. I found myself still dipping into it while I was dishing it. Going to become a new staple in my kitchen. You don't even need the parmesan but it does add a great flavor, it makes great into excellent."
173579,34382,2011-04-06,5,These were fantastic!  Thanks for posting.
312577,34382,2011-10-19,5,Excellent and easy to make.  I added a little bacon too!
456858,34382,2012-03-05,3,"These were just OK 4 me, may or may not make again.  If I do make again, I may add additional garlic."
298447,34382,2012-09-10,5,"So wonderful and yet, couldn't be more simple to prepare.  A definite keeper!  Thanks as always, MizzNezz.  : )"
176615,34382,2014-07-16,5,"Very tasty and really easy, too! I added a little extra milk. Garlic flavor is not strong, so could add more if desired. We enjoyed it as is. Thanks for the recipe!"
198154,34382,2015-06-13,4,"We got some red potatoes in our farm box. I didn&#039;t have any fresh garlic, so I added some Trader Joe&#039;s crushed garlic to the potatoes after I drained them.  I also used buttermilk instead of milk.  Everyone in my family liked them and gave them between 4 and 5 stars, a true complement from my sometimes picky eaters!"
1581225,34382,2017-06-03,5,These were very tasty and easy - no peeling required. Ill definitely make them again.
189475,34382,2018-01-19,5,"These were amazing! I doubled the butter, used 2 heads of roasted garlic and used light cream instead of milk. Best mashed potatoes ever!"
64934,30366,2003-10-27,5,"Great recipe, Bev!   I made this to go with your meat loaf and it was wonderful!  I followed the recipe as posted, using a medium cheddar, but realized I was a little low on milk, so I opened a can of evaporated milk to use.  The end result was a creamy, delicious dish!  Thanks for sharing another wonderful recipe Bev!!"
64203,30366,2005-09-14,5,"This was cheesy, tasty and easy! I used large shell noodles instead of the elbow macaroni just because that's what I had on hand. I didn't do anything else to compensate for the change and it turned out perfect! I love the browned cheese on the top and the creamy yet cheesy sauce. I'll be making this time and time again.
Thanks Bev!"
184723,30366,2005-10-05,5,"I've tried many mac and cheese recipes on here and this by far is the easiest and quickest. Made exactly as directed and not SUPER cheesy... but creamy, tasty and a family pleaser.  Will make again in the future. Thanks, Bev!"
146486,30366,2005-11-01,5,"This mac and cheese is delicious!  I had a big ham that was just begging for a nice cheesy side dish, and this was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
43083,30366,2006-09-23,4,"I made this for our potluck at work y'day and even though it was eaten cold, I got a bunch of compliments on it! THREE people brought in Mac & Cheese and mine was the one almost totally gone!! Thanks Bev. I reheated the leftovers for breakfast today and it was very yummy!"
402559,30366,2007-02-07,5,"Used equal amounts of butter and flour (1/4 cup each) and used a combination of mozzarella, pepper jack and cheddar cheeses. Great thanks!"
50969,30366,2007-03-24,4,"I wanted to fix macaroni and cheese,but I wanted something out of the ordinary,but I still wanted ""comfort food"" so I chose this.And I'm so glad this is the one I chose.Instead of using the amount of milk stated, I just used 2 cups.And you were ""right on the money""with the baking time.The amount of dry mustard just gave recipe the ""right amount of zing""
This will be made again,thank you for posting.""Keep Smiling:)"""
180090,30366,2007-04-05,5,"Ooo...this was heavenly! I loved this mac n cheese, it was creamy, cheesy and delicious. The sauce would also be great on broccoli or asparagus! I will be making this often, thanks Bev!"
56087,30366,2007-04-20,5,"Am so glad I saw this and decided to give it a go.  Little effort in putting it together for an amazing mac & cheese.  Grandson INSISTED on taking some leftover in his lunchbag.  Exactly the way it's supposed to be, creamy and cheesy!!"
103876,30366,2007-05-12,5,I made this tonight for my kids and my niece and nephew who are staying with us for the weekend.  All the kids loved it and had second helpings.  I thought it was good too.  So I think that deserves five stars!
189616,30366,2007-07-19,5,"Ahhh Comfort food! I added 1 more Tbsp. of butter and sauteed a chopped onion in it, since I was making this as a main course meal I added cubed ham.
Thank You Bev!!!"
64583,30366,2007-09-24,5,"Super delicious!  We like our macaroni and cheese a little on the dry side, so I added nearly the entire 1 lb. box of pasta (I used shells).  Instead of just cheese on top, I mixed the remaining 1/2 cup cheese with bread crumbs and crushed Ritz crackers then sprinkled on top.    We served it as a main dish with just a nice green salad and cut up veggies.  This is something I'm sure to be making on a regular basis."
280166,30366,2007-09-26,4,"Since I refuse to purchase that stuff in the blue box, my kids usu groan when I announce I'm making ""homemade mac n cheese"", but not this time! We all had two helpings!!  Thanks Bev for posting!"
347822,30366,2007-10-13,3,"I prepared this dish for my boyfriend who is a huge mac n' cheese lover.  He liked it, but preferred the box version :(.  My notes include - to thicken the sauce it took me approx. 18 mins.  Also, as per a reviewer, I used velveeta cheese.  Took approx. 25 mins to be lightly browned."
126440,30366,2011-11-20,5,Loved the creaminess and the flavors.  I had 8 oz. of Tillamook garlic white cheddar to try and just loved it.  Faint flavor of garlic that we loved.
371738,30366,2007-11-24,5,"I have tried the boxed macaroni and cheese once in my life and hated it.  This was my first time making homemade macaroni and cheese and it was fabulous!  I doubled the recipe and am very glad I did.  My kids loved it.  I used 2 cups mild cheddar and 2 cups Colby.  I added breadcrumbs on one half of the casserole.  Perfect directions.  There is absolutely no reason to try any other recipe --- this is it for us.  Thanks, Bev."
53932,30366,2007-12-12,5,This is the perfect comfort food.  I used an extra sharp cheddar and thought that provided a really nice flavor.  The sauce was creamy and well seasoned.  I did sprinkle some mozzarella on top as I didn't leave enough cheddar but that was a great addition.
140132,30366,2008-01-17,5,cheesy creamy goodness....what more could you ask for....thanks it was delicious....STephanie
248023,30366,2008-01-28,5,"Really great mac n cheese without a lot of ""weird"" ingredients.  This is the homestyle mac n cheese recipe I have been using for years (minus the mustard) and love it.  I like the little tang the dry mustard gives it.  My BF ate almost half of it himself and said he would gladly eat the leftovers for lunch ( he HATES leftovers usually!). Thanks so much for posting!!!"
229524,30366,2008-01-31,5,My DH said his dad would have loved this Macaroni and Cheese :)  So glad we tried it.  We really liked it and this will now become a family favorite.  Thanks Bev.
242484,30366,2008-02-05,5,"Alright...this was seriously some good mac & cheese!  Even my husband who is a die-hard velveeta mac & cheese fan, enjoyed it.  I made it for company as a side dish and they said it was the best they've tasted!"
125640,30366,2008-02-08,4,This was good comfort food. It has a nice flavor and it's creamy and cheesy. I sprinked an extra 3/4 cup cheddar and a little grated Parmesan on the top. It was also quick and easy to make. Thanks for sharing.
140806,30366,2008-02-11,5,"This is perfect mac and cheese!  I used an extra sharp cheddar...and maybe next time I will add provolone as well. I top mine with the remaining cheese, bread crumbs, and a few pats of butter to make a bit of a crust. We must have needed extra comfort when we ate this, because DH and I gobbled up ALL of this comfort food."
68460,30366,2008-02-17,5,"This is perfect macaroni and cheese!  My first time ever making it from scratch and my family loved it; everyone had seconds.  I made this with fat-free, lactose-free milk and sharp white cheddar.  It was SO good!  Thanks for posting this recipe Bev, it will for sure be made again at my house!"
377581,30366,2008-02-24,4,Simple comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly. It was very quick and easy to put together using ingredients I always have on hand. This was very creamy and good. Thanks!
138429,30366,2008-03-11,5,Great recipe. So easy yet so tasty. Enjoyed by all. Thanks
789516,30366,2008-05-16,5,I also found that you need more then 8oz of macaroni for all the liquid.  I used 12.  Very good taste though!
499050,30366,2008-07-23,3,Good.
969481,30366,2008-11-26,4,"This was good. I made this as a side dish with meatloaf muffins (#15578) and roasted green beans (#261758). I also substituted 1 cup of milk for heave cream (calories, I know...) and the kids we just overjoyed and cleared their plates. Thanks for posting!"
145352,30366,2009-02-05,5,This is it!!! My boys declared this the best mac and cheese ever!!! I upped the amount of cheese and pasta...just eye-balled it.
218535,30366,2009-09-10,3,3-stars because my husband liked it but not the children.
768828,30366,2009-11-15,5,"This was really good.  I added some crumbled bacon as Lalagirl suggested.  I didn't read her review until after it was in the oven, so just added to the top.  Otherwise I make exactly as written.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Bev for sharing.  I can't wait to try some of your other recipes."
172369,30366,2010-03-10,5,"Perfect creamy, cheesy heavenly!"
357358,30366,2010-04-04,5,"Wonderful! Even my daughter, who keeps the company that makes Velveeta in business, really enjoyed this mac & cheese. ;) I loved it as it reminded me of what I had at family gatherings in Kansas when I was very young. Thanks for sharing with us, Bev."
133174,30366,2011-06-09,5,Easy and oh so delicious.  This was made gluten free by using gluten free flour and rice pasta.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  There were no leftovers. It is easy to see why the recipe have so many wonderful reviews.
39835,30366,2012-11-04,4,Very good even with the whole wheat pasta I used. next time I will use a bit extra cheese though. Thanks for sharing!
894666,30366,2015-12-13,5,"This was so easy, we have tried multiple mac and cheese recipes with much more complicated combinations of cheese, loved the simplicity and flavor of this. We did this recipe + 1/2 which perfectly fit a 9x13 pan, fed 5 of us with just a bit leftover. Only modification I did was add a couple TBSP of Franks hot sauce, sprinkled on some garlic salt, then the shredded cheddar topping, then a layer of panko crumbs. Will make again with crumbled bacon and green onions next time. Thanks for this quick and versatile recipe!!"
92886,108775,2005-11-07,3,"I liked the idea of the unique blend of ingredients.  The directions were easy and clear to follow, but the taste was not overly appealing to me.  But I don't regret making it,if it seems appealing to you I would say try it, maybe it will be more compatable with your tastebuds."
22015,108775,2006-03-24,5,"I have to agree.   This was very good.   When I was mixing this up I discovered that I was completely out of butter, so I mixed the mustard & honey - spread that on the salmon, then mixed the other topping ingredients and put them on top of the honey mustard.   Then as a sub for the butter I sprayed the top of the bread crumbs with PAM.   It worked fine for us.   "
394077,108775,2007-01-15,5,This is an excellent salmon dish.  My DD made it for me and I absolutely love it. A keeper
174991,108775,2007-05-28,5,"This is a different fish recipe that caught my eye.  Very elegant and tasty, even DH (not a fish fan) said he would love to have this again.  The only change was that I used olive oil in place of butter."
579298,108775,2007-12-02,5,"Are you a believer in Love At First Bite?? I wasn't but now I am! I am not a fan of fish, but I know that if cooked right (like Pecan Crusted Grouper from one of my fav restaurants) I eat it up. I have been on a mission to unravel only the best of the best recipes for fish - in order to incorporate it into my diet. And this one, so far, TOPS the list. For those of you non-believers out there, you need to try this one.... you surely will fall in love. I myself, used honey butter in stead of regular butter (and still added honey), and in addition to the bread crumbs I used wheat germ, for just a slight bit more additional nutrients. 1/8 cup Wheat Germ & 1/8 cup bread crumbs. Dijon mustard, Pecans and a Lemon were the rest of my choices. TigerJo, you should have kept this recipe a secret, but boy am I glad you didn't!"
248023,108775,2007-12-03,5,"Really really easy way to prepare salmon... we are trying to eat more fish but I just hate ""plain"" baked fish... I was a little skeptical at first, since the ingredients seemed like they would not taste good combined... BUT I was wrong.  Somehow, all the ingredients combined just transformed a plain filet of salmon into something spectacular!  I halved the recipe for 2 servings and all the ingredients accordingly... I seemed to have a lot of the butter mixture leftover however... but the crumb mixture was perfect to top off both filets.  It smelled so good while baking and the tops browned to a golden brown and was delightfully crispy.  I think I overcooked it just slightly, but I will watch it more carefully next time... Thanks for a keeper for life!!!"
357358,108775,2007-12-25,5,Simple with such good flavor that even the salmon hater in crowd liked it. I used the butter mixture to grease the foil instead of spray. Flavor top and bottom that way. Thanks for a great Christmas dinner.
265954,108775,2008-01-01,5,"Just a wonderful recipe.  Salmon intimidates me, since it often comes out ""fishy,"" so I run salmon under cold water for about two minutes before cooking or seasoning it, and then pat dry.  As for the recipe, I made as is, only using regular table salt, omitting any lemon or lime, which I thought would have overpowered the honey mustard taste, and using slivered almonds instead of walnuts or pecans.  I served with steamed broccoli and cheesy baked garlic bread.   I baked for 15 minutes, and the salmon was EXCELLENT...I would not have baked it a minute less or more!!  Thanks for posting this great salmon recipe!"
39835,108775,2008-01-12,5,Delicious salmon - I cut down on the honey a bit with wonderful results. We served this with baked potatoes and a tossed salad for a super easy and delicious supper! Thanks for sharing this keeper!
158086,108775,2008-08-07,5,"I have never been a big fan of salmon, though I love every other fish...so I thought I would give this recipe a try and went and bought some....we loved it!...I will be making this alot now that
I have found a recipe that we both like...thanks..."
169969,108775,2009-03-14,5,We loved this dish!!!!! It was quick and easy and I would consider it a crowd pleaser. I will be making this recipe again.
60992,108775,2009-07-28,5,"What a wonderfully different way to prepare salmon!!! I had about half of the butter mixture leftover so I think I could easily cut all that in half. The flavors so complement the salmon and nothing overpowers...just beautiful. The lemon squeezed on top makes everythign just ""pop"". I do think next time I will try adding some garlic...I kept thinking I was getting a slight ""DeJoghne"" flavor and I think that might be an interesting twist. This will be made when I need to impress and do not have a lot of time as so much of this can be prepped ahead and put together at last minute."
305531,108775,2009-09-03,5,Very good salmon. This was easy to prepare and tasted great. Thanks TigerJo. Made for Cookbook Tag.
97579,108775,2010-01-03,4,"I made this and really enjoyed the flavor.  My only dislike, which may have been my fault, is the breadcrumbs.  When I took it out of the over it was still somewhat just breadcrumbs.  I think next time I may add a little butter to them to see if they crisp up.  Otherwise, very tasty and will definately make again!"
368078,108775,2010-06-11,5,"Another 5 star for this one!  We thought it was excellent!  We made just as directed, only we halved the ingredients and only made with 2 salmon fillets.  We used pecans this time, but can't wait to try the other options as well.  Thanks for such a fun and different recipe!"
140132,108775,2010-10-27,5,"I cut this down for 1 person,as my family is out of town.  Oh my goodness, this is delicious.  I loved the mustard flavor mixed with the sweetness of the honey and the nuts and breadcrumbs.  This is so good, I can't wait for the next time I make this.  Thank you for sharing this very good recipe."
1052873,108775,2010-12-26,5,"This was wonderful! Used the frozen salmon filet portions (thawed) from Costco, Panko, and dried parsley but otherwise followed exactly. Regular bread crumbs would probably have been better, but this is the best salmon I've had outside the roadside stands in Alaska!"
362983,108775,2011-02-15,5,Amazing! I loved the combination of the mustard and honey.. then the crunch from the walnuts.. yum! I used olive oil in place of the butter. Will definitely have to make this often! Thanks!
173579,108775,2011-04-17,5,Great recipe.  Loved the nut topping.  Thanks for posting.
1179225,108775,2011-12-30,5,"Super good, considering DH and I don't care for salmon. We were given some high quality salmon from a friend who just came back from Alaska. Its such a healthy food and DH and I have really wanted to learn to like it. Your recipe is the closest we've come to loving salmon. Thanks for posting!"
15521,108775,2012-01-21,4,"This was a good recipe.  I have a similar recipe from Southern Living that I have made for years. I could not find that recipe, so tried this one.  It seemed less crispy than the version I have, and I'm not sure my verison uses honey.  It was a nice meal that is easy and quick to prepare.  Thanks for sharing."
482376,108775,2012-01-27,5,"YUM! What a delicious combination of flavors and textures. The mustard (I used a coarse country dijon), honey and walnuts were sooooooo good with the salmon. Directions for cooking were perfect. The only change I will make next time is to decrease the breadcrumbs  to 1/8 cup and increase the chopped walnuts to 1/2 cup. Thanks for a keeper! I'm putting this recipe into my best of the best file. :)"
226863,108775,2012-02-23,5,"So good!  I halved the recipe with no problems.  I think I might like a little more mustard mixture next time...some of my bread crumbs didn't absorb the flavors.  This is just delicious, and I'll enjoy this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!"
1365025,108775,2012-04-19,4,I don't like mustard but went ahead and used it. Fortunately you couldn't taste it much with the finally results. I also put this under the broiler for a few minutes when it was done to brown the top. This tasted good.
68460,108775,2013-02-26,0,"Fantastic!  I used pecans and I'll try the walnuts next time.  This was just so delicious I can't stand it.  I kid you not...our 21-YO cat stared at us while we ate with drool coming out of his mouth so we just had to save a chunk for him.  He wolfed it down and is now snoring, LOL.  I love making everyone happy!  My husband and I really loved the combination of flavors and textures in this salmon recipe.  This is going into our 'favorites' folder!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Tigerjo :)"
142367,108775,2013-07-14,5,"Another 5 star review? Yeah, well, I figure I need to pay tribute. I have made this twice and both times there was nary a crumb left, except for the skin and the cat made short work of that. A definite keeper -- thank you for sharing!!!"
37779,108775,2013-09-01,5,"Delicious. Loved the nutty topping. Easy prep, too. Thanks"
198154,108775,2017-12-04,4,When I was looking at this recipe my husband said &quot;Nuts on fish? Can you just leave them off?&quot; So I put them in the blender until they were close to the same consistency as the bread crumbs. He didn't realize they were on there until I told him. We all enjoyed it this way.
29014,59780,2003-04-23,5,"Do I love easy & delicious recipes, or what?!  For using only four ingredients, this was excellent.  I decided to make this last minute so I pulled a (yup) frozen roast out (ok - it was a *small* roast!) and tossed it in the crockpot first, set it on high to let the meat thaw.  Then I added the other ingredients, set pot to low, and let cook for 8 hours.  Served with mashed potatoes and string beans - yum!  Already have given the recipe out - it's a keeper!"
59780,59780,2004-05-17,5,This was awesome! I left the recipe out for my husband who put this together while I was in classes. He was surprised that he could make such a super supper with very little effort. I loved the flavour of the gravy and the meat was so tender. We served this with Idaho potatoes recipe#84424 and glazed carrots recipe#22684. Thanks for suggesting this for my May Menu. I have posted a picture here for everyone to see!
135887,59780,2005-04-03,5,"We loved this roast.  I used a 2 lb. chuck roast.  I think next time I will try a leaner cut to reduce the fat.  Otherwise, awesome!"
229850,59780,2006-09-25,5,"This is one of the yummiest roasts I have ever made. I am excited because it was also one of the cheapest!!!!! I doubled everything, the only difference was I did not have any pkg gravy mix, so I substituted 2 cans ready made brown gravy, but I still used all the apple juice. There is now plenty to do as other reviewers suggested and make a stew from leftover tomorrow! Thanx for a great recipe!"
632249,59780,2008-01-20,4,"This was so tender and delicious. I was skeptical about the apple juice but it adds a fabulous flavour.  Next time, I will reduce the apple juice to 1 cup as I found it a bit sweet, but that is just my personal taste.  I did brown the roast prior to adding to the crock pot. As suggested by another reviewer, I will make a stew with the leftovers. Thanks for sharing this!"
89831,81611,2004-02-16,5,"Miraklegirl...these were just wonderful, and boy did I ever get a rise out of them...very moist, I love cooking with sourcream, it just makes everything bake out so much better.... I subbed the milk for half and half cream, I didn't have anu unsalted butter, so I just used regular salted butter, they still turned out fantastic...this is an outstanding muffin recipe, I recommend this highly...thank you Miraklegirl for posting such an awesome recipe, I will be making these again and again :-)"
128473,81611,2006-05-24,5,"These are Amazing. Thank you so much for sharing Miraklegirl. We enjoyed these so much. They were light and fluffy, sweet, tart, tall, easy to make and they were ready very quickly. I wish I could give you more than 5*'s...they certainly deserve 10*....Kudos "
59163,81611,2006-08-05,5,These were fabulous.  My new favorite blueberry muffin recipe.
47907,81611,2006-08-15,4,These muffins came out very nice!  I made as posted and actually made 24 muffins instead of the 16 muffins.  The recipe is easy to put together and you won't be disapointed in making these!!  Thanks for posting!
312577,81611,2012-01-16,5,"Great blueberry muffins.  With so many choices out there.  These are my favorite!  I made a little crumb topping (flour, brown sugar and cut in butte) and they were amazing.  This will be my go to recipe for blueberry muffins.  Thank you."
37036,31128,2002-07-10,5,"The BEST ever apple pie!  I was going to post this same recipe, but I first did a search to see if it were posted yet.  My neighbor, Jill, brought this pie to us when a friennd of my husbands and his family were killed in a car accident.  My husband kept asking me everyday for about a week to get the recipe from Jill.  I finally got it and it's the ONLY apple pie recipe I use!  I also use Granny Smith apples and I peel and slice them very thin.  I use only about 4 - 4 1/2 cups of sliced apples and it works perfect for a normal size 9-inch pastry."
8629,31128,2002-07-28,5,"I have to give this recipe 5 stars because I made it for the first time yesterday, entered the pie in our local Park District's Pie Contest and won the 'Best Tasting Pie' award!  That says alot about the recipe because I am not a very experienced pie maker at all.  For future reference, it took 4 large Granny Smith apples to get my 6 cups of sliced apples for the recipe.  I peeled and cored the apples and cut them into 12 slices each.  Thanks for the great recipe."
76951,73488,2004-05-02,4,This was very good.  I halved the cream cheese mixture & icing and used 1 1/2 cans of crescent rolls.  I felt the icing was too sweet - kinda overwhelmed the danish.  Next time I'll omit the icing altogether.
8629,73488,2004-06-25,5,"I knew this was going to be a 5-star review when I tasted the cream cheese filling and wanted to eat the entire bowl right then.  I made the filling the night before and refrigerated it until I made the danish in the morning.  I got exactly 40 mini danish and used all of the filling.  For the 2nd batch of danish, after they were done cooking, I topped them with about 1/2 teaspoon of raspberry jam and then iced them.  I'm going to make these again real soon."
101034,73488,2004-11-17,5,"These were wonderful tasting little treats. I followed your recipe exactly as written, I didn't change a thing. I took the advice of another reviewer and used my electric mixer to beat the cream cheese mixture and it turned out perfect. I also put the crescent dough in the freezer for alittle while to firm it up for easier slicing. We loved the taste of these, also the fact that they couldn't be easier to make!!!! Thanks ms__bold for a great recipe.   "
91392,73488,2004-12-29,5,"Oh, so good!  I had to use what I have in France, which meant roll out croissants, but I don't think that affected anything.  I also put a bit of marmalade on the cheese, then mixed more into the topping.  Came close to the ""orange danish"" rolls from the US.  I will definitely do these again!"
119466,73488,2005-01-09,5,"Wow, these were wonderful! I actually cut the dough into 24 slices (because I wasn't paying attention & was used to doing so for a different recipe), but I just made the indentations as large & deep as I could, filled them up with the cream cheese mixture, & they came out just fantastic. I put a dab of rasberry jam on a few, but we really preferred the ones without. These were fun to make--thanks for sharing!"
37449,73488,2005-04-24,5,"I made these this morning for breakfast along with Mexican Hash Brown and over easy eggs. My DH and DS and I just loved them. Quick, easy, delicious! Thanks ms_bold!"
68884,73488,2005-07-24,5,"So easy, & yet my brunch guests kept asking me where I ""bought"" these adorable danish! :) I used winkki's great tip & put the crescent dough in the freezer for a few minutes to ""firm"" it (it WAS the hottest weekend of the year here!). I mounded the cream cheese in pretty well, and added some blueberry preserves to half of the rolls. I also added a few drops of lemon extract to the icing, & very lightly drizzled it. It's easy to think of other varieties you can do with these versatile little gems! Thanks as always, Vote_For_Pedro :)"
136997,73488,2005-08-05,5,Just add me to the list of raves! These are so neat and easy to make. I did have a bit of trouble slicing them and then remembered my trick I have for cutting cinimon dough buns. I use a string. That way they don't get all smooshed when slicing.
222055,73488,2005-08-13,5,What everybody else said!
50969,73488,2005-08-23,4,"i found these to be very good.after filling some of danish with the cream cheese,i added some cocoa powder to the rest of the filling.i of course had to do a ""quality control test"" and they passed with flying colors :) i will be making these again.thanks for posting."
35526,73488,2005-10-23,5,Wonderful!  Perfect for an easy breakfast.  Made me look like a star chef and it was just as easy as could be.  I made half with just the cream cheese filling and half with habanero garlic jelly and cream cheese filling.
47907,73488,2005-11-13,5,There's not much I can add to all the other reviews except that these wonderful and quick and taste like I had been baking all morning!  I used a serrated knife to cut the dough and had no problems.  I used my whisk to swirl the icing over warm pastries.  Thanks for posting a keeper!
13796,73488,2005-11-22,5,Ok... ready for number 40 review? These were a BIG hit. So easy and delicious. I used some cherry pie filling for half of them. I mixed the cream cheese mixture before I went to work and refrigerated it until evening when I assembled the little danish. Thanks for a great idea.
36944,73488,2005-11-28,5,These were easy to make and tasted delicious!  They also reheated well in the oven.  (I don't suggest using the microwave for reheating these.)  I used some strawberry and raspberry preserves on mine.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Vote_for_Pedro!
132383,73488,2006-01-07,5,"MIL is visiting and she loves sweets!  So, I decided to make these for her...we all loved them.  Thanks for posting such an easy, wonderful recipe!"
175824,73488,2006-04-05,5,Delicious and easy. I also used my mixer to beat the cream cheese. Wow what a wonderful flavor. I also froze the cresent rolls befor slicing. I put the whole can in the freezer. I left it in the freezer about 4 hours. They were firm enough to slice nicely. Thanks ms-bold for such a tasty and easy treat.
158086,73488,2006-04-30,5,These turned out fabulous...I made them sugar free and cannot believe how simple these are...I have a feeling I will be making these constantly
160974,73488,2006-05-02,5,"I made these for our church coffee hour. They went over very well. I did freeze my cans of dough to make slicing easier.

92816,73488,2007-03-24,5,"These are so quick and easy to make!And so delicious.I used blueberry jam on mine.I can't wait until I get some homemade strawberry jam to put on them.That would be the icing on the cake,literally.Thanks for posting such a great recipe."
103876,73488,2007-07-15,5,"These rolls are awesome!  I used breadstick dough because that was what I had on hand and it worked perfect.  I topped each one with a small amount of strawberry jam, brushed the roll with a little melted butter and sprinkled with some course colored sugar.  I really like these because they are so easy to make and taste wonderful!"
140132,73488,2008-01-01,5,Holy cow! These are sinful.  So good but I could eat the whole pan...LOL.  We loved this recipe and are already planning on making them again soon.  We made them for breakfast but can make them anytime of the day for a snack or dessert.  Thank you for a very yummy addition to our regulars.....STephanie
316717,73488,2008-01-07,5,this was sooo goood and so easy to make. i did have to add a little more milk to thin out the icing but other than that it was perfect. thanks for sharing!
461834,73488,2008-03-17,5,"I made these for our Sunday breakfast and they went quick.  This is so easy and tasty, with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I used a 5 oz. can of biscuits, so I cut the ingredients to a fourth of the amounts.  Next time will only cut the recipe to half the amounts, because we would have eaten more of these danishes.  Thanks ms_bold for a wonderful breakfast treat!!!!"
104295,73488,2008-03-24,5,"Made this for Easter breakfast.  Easy, fast, and very tasty.  I did need to add some more milk to the confectioner's sugar glaze.  Otherwise easy and devoured."
218535,73488,2008-05-19,5,wonderfully quick. I used nutella as the filling instead. YUMMY.
264017,73488,2008-05-25,5,"This is a gem of a recipe! I made a batch for a brunch today and they were so pretty and elegant sitting on a glass tray. No one would ever guess how easy these are to make, especially if you prepare the filling and frosting ahead of time. I did use the mixer to cream the filling, so I had no lumps. Thanks ms_bold!"
485151,73488,2009-11-15,5,These were great!!! So easy to make since the base was crescent rolls. I used the thread trick to cut the dough without smooshing it. It worked like a charm & I didn't have to freeze it first! My boys and I loved them. Next time I want to try putting a little jam on top before baking too.
1179225,73488,2016-12-26,5,Yum! I'm not a big fan of cresent dough so I used your filling and glaze recipe and puff pastry and it was just what I was wanting. Thanks for sharing your recipe!
147109,31128,2004-07-07,5,"I made this for a cookout with a bunch of friends and my brother.  I wish I would have made a couple, because my brother just about ate half the pie himself. Everybody raved, and my brother just oohs and ahhs anytime I even think about making another one, he keeps begging!  All the guys at the cookout told my boyfriend they are jealous as well! I used pretty thin slices of the apples, which I thought was perfect.  Nice touch with the caramel and pecans. Thanks for this awesome recipe!"
52543,31128,2004-10-21,5,"This pie takes decadence to a whole new level! I used recipe #51537, My No Roll Pie Crust by Laurie as the base, 5 Courtland apples in the filling & Kittencal's Easiest Caramel Sauce (recipe #78088) for the topping. I served the pie while still warm with frozen yogurt to reduce my pangs of guilt (LOL). Thanx Wendy!"
56087,31128,2004-11-01,4,"This was pretty darn good.  BUT I tried it with the skin still on and probably wouldn't do it again as my family didn't like the skin on, plus it makes it really hard when your cutting to take a bite.. So if I did make it with the skin on, I'd cut the apples in chunks instead of slices.  Will make again.  Thanks for the great recipe."
60260,31128,2004-11-21,5,"Excellent Pie!! Everyone loved it and can't wait to have it again.  I used granny smith apples and didn't peel but will peel next time, we didn't care for them being on.  I cooked exactly as directed.  The pie is piled high and I was really worried I'd have stuff running all over the oven but not a drip ran off and the pie looked gorgeous. Can't wait to try this one on guests!"
58836,31128,2005-02-07,4,This was pretty good.  I agree with another reviewer.  It would have been good without the caramel sauce and nuts.  Thanks
158086,31128,2005-10-23,5,Oh My! I thought I made the best apple pie....this one blows mine right out of the water.....It is a combo of a pie and crisp...wonderful...I am making this for Thanksgiving...I used Splendra and just drizzled a Tablespoon of carmel on top as we have diabetics here and it was perfect...just enouph sweetness...great recipe...
80998,31128,2006-11-23,5,"I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was wonderful!  I double the topping because we wanted a lot of it! I come from a long line of award winning apple pie bakers, but this was the best!  (shh....don't tell them!)"
269331,31128,2006-12-31,5,"Wow this was GREAT!  I used granny smith apples, peeled and sliced.  It was a challenge (but fun) piling in all the apples and then applying the crumb topping.  It looked like Machu Picchu!  To my relief, it cooked down just fine.  Donâ€™t forget to add the caramel sauce, it really makes the dish."
180090,31128,2007-01-06,5,"YUM! This is a wonderful recipe for apple pie. I made my own crust and baked for 8 minutes before adding the pie filling. I didn't put the caramel sauce on the whole pie, but drizzled on each serving, and I omitted the pecans. I used 6 baby granny smith apples but next time I'll add more apples and cut in bigger slices so it is chunkier. The oat topping is delicious! This recipe is very easy to make and gets eaten very fast, so making two pies would be a good idea! Thanks posting, I'll be making this many more times!"
185446,31128,2007-07-28,5,"The title of this recipe really does sum it all up.  Thank you, Wendy N. for sharing your grandmother's recipe.  If this is a sampling of her cooking, I'd like to live at her house."
185285,31128,2007-09-04,5,"10 star recipe. Even the non-apple pie lovers of the group were raving as people actually went back for seconds!! I used a mixture of granny smith and golden delicious apples. Wow. Too good for words.  I made it ahead of time and served it later in the day, which worked fine."
13796,31128,2007-09-14,5,Delicious. I didn't have the caramel ice cream topping so I used 14 caramels and 2 ounces of evaporated milk and melted them together in a small saucepan. It worked great!
229524,31128,2007-11-06,5,My DH's favorite pie of all has always been Pecan Pie....until now ...after trying this he said this was his favorite pie.  I couldn't believe it!!!!!!  That says a lot about this WONDERFUL pie:)  It has such a terrific flavor.  We love the crumb topping.  This pie is very easy to make.  I did use Granny Smith as you sugguest Wendy N.  Thank you so much for sharing your grandmothers recipe and tell her how much we love her wonderful pie :)
142559,31128,2007-11-22,5,"VERY good pie!!  I used 6 braeburn apples, was a little higher than it should have been, but I do love a pie that is LOADED with apples! One note: I did not have the caramel topping, so I thought I would melt some Kraft caramels and drizzle on top. While the taste was still there, the caramel hardened fast, making it hard to cut and chew. I would recommend sticking to the caramel topping as suggested in the recipe. Great pie, very easy, will make again!"
32058,31128,2007-11-23,5,"Made as a Thanksgiving dessert.  It was yuMmy.  I think it is better FREsh from the oven as I had made it before and it was better recieved then  This one I made ahead of time (1 day) and it got a little soggY.   I will make again and again, just keeping in mind to make it the day of for best taste!"
394077,31128,2007-12-28,5,"Very very delicious.  I skipped the final topping because we don't like it very sweet.  It is still to die for with ice cream.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  The next time,  I will try to  make it without the pie crust like apple crumble. I bet it would be so good."
145352,31128,2008-01-01,5,Everyone loved this. Thanks!!!!!!!
81611,31128,2008-04-05,4,"Very good pie! I have a severe sweet tooth, but it was still a tad overly sweet (it was for 2 of my kids). I used galas, and replaced 1/2 of the brown sugar w/sucanat. I also went easy on the final topping; my pie was quite mounded already! This recipe is a keeper."
173579,31128,2008-08-31,5,The best tasting pie you will ever want to eat.  The caramel topping just made it.  I can see why this recipe has 153 ratings. Fantastic!  Thanks for posting.
168462,31128,2008-09-05,5,This pie is so easy to make and the taste is fantastic. My husband and daughter both gave this a huge thumbs up. I only had walnuts in the house so I subbed them for the pecans.  Thanks for the recipe.
318235,31128,2008-10-02,5,"This was great. I served it with ice cream last night at a dinner party. I also made homemade caramel sauce which added a nice touch, it did make it a little sweeter though I think. Thank you!"
135887,31128,2008-10-05,4,OK - made as directed but my apples were still very crunchy and crust was too brown.  Will make adjustments accordingly.
132383,31128,2008-10-13,5,All I can say is delicious!  I made it Saturday and it was gone by Sunday.  I will never make another regular apple pie.  Thanks so much for posting.
64583,31128,2008-11-28,5,Absolutely delicious!  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  The topping is so crunchy and sweet and the apples (I used Granny Smith) had great cinnamon flavor.
353131,31128,2008-11-29,5,Made this for Thanksgiving. Every member of our family loved it!! My BIl raved and had to have 2 pieces. I left out the nuts because my kids won't eat them. I will never make another apple pie!! The caramel sends it over the top.
426903,31128,2008-12-01,0,"My sister typically makes this pie for thanksgiving. She was away at college this year so I told my family I would make it. I am not giving it a rating because I think there might be a chance that I did something wrong. I have tasted it before so I know it was good, but this time it came out runny. I don't know if it was the moisture in the apples, or maybe needing more time. I will have to try it again and see. I used granny smith apples, which was the only variation I used. I will cross my fingers the next time I make this. Thanks for posting."
195589,31128,2009-03-27,5,"I am not a big pie maker and this turned out great! I also used the Pillsbury ready-crust and cooked it ahead for 10 minutes. The second time I made this, I used Fuji apples that were on sale. I think using Granny Smith''s are much better! Thanks for posting!"
333017,31128,2009-08-16,0,"I am not going to rate this as I had changed the original recipe drastically...but I did use it as a guide.  I had used some fresh apples off of my friend's tree and some Granny Smith.  I made my own pie shell using JackieOhNo!'s Recipe #320803.  I took into account other comments regarding how sweet the filling and toppings were, so I cut the filling down to 1/4 cup sugar.  The topping I changed to 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and 6T butter and kept the rest the same.  I used my Recipe #368718 for the final topping and omitted the pecans.  Although the other apple I used was tart, it was soft and didn't hold up against the Granny Smith, so the pie flattened out somewhat.  But that did not diminish from the taste.  As my DH grew up on different pies, he loved this one, so I would do this one again, with my changes!!!"
97579,31128,2009-09-27,5,"This was wonderful!  I didn't add the carmel topping and it was perfect.  I used 4 cups of Wolf River apples, (I never had heard of these, but at the cider mill today they were recommended since the Spies weren't ready yet) and 2 cups of  mutsu.  Loved it!"
126440,31128,2009-09-29,5,"I made this as an apple crisp, no pie shell.  It had great reviews from family.  Will make this many times."
172369,31128,2009-10-03,5,"I made as directed and did not follow threw with the directions and took out of the oven at 30 minutes, I was lucky the apples I used was soft, because it was delicious, thanks for sharing this great recipe. I made one for my neighbor and one  for my lawyer and one for me!"
1072593,31128,2009-10-04,5,A pie that will make 'your' grandma jealous!  Made for An Apple A Day Tag.
1122161,31128,2009-10-10,5,"This pie was so good! It took me 6 large granny smith's per pie to make 6 cups, but I sliced them really thin in the food processor. I loved that there was still a little tartness in the apples and then you get the sweet on top. Really great recipe, and thanks for sharing!"
620763,31128,2009-10-20,5,"Delicious apple pie! Best served with vanilla ice cream of course! I used a total of 5 apples, or about 5 cups, and that was plenty.  This recipe makes a ton of topping mixture. I piled on what I could, but did not used it all."
140132,31128,2009-10-28,5,Heaven!  This has to be one of the best pies I have made.  I made this last night for our guests and we all loved it.  I especially loved the topping with the apples.....yummy.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.
1365025,31128,2009-10-30,5,Delicious apple pie. A couple of years ago we had a man running for office in our city and as a promotional item he gave out this recipe. I lost the recipe and never got to try it out until now. Thanks for posting it.
439797,31128,2009-11-15,5,"My husband says this is the best pie he has ever had.  I made it just as written.  I used the crust recipe where you just make it in the pan, so the whole thing was super easy.  The only thing I might change is to make my own caramel sauce next time.  Rob had a headache - and we wondered if it was the chemicals in the prepackaged sauce.  Terrific recipe."
316717,31128,2009-11-20,5,i made this for my husbands work and it was a huge hit. i used 4 granny smith apples. i made 2 pies so the first pie i used 4 large granny smith apples and the 2nd pie i used 4 med size granny apples and i much prefer the  medium size. i also halfed the sugar topping on one of the pies and i prefered the one w/ the full amount of sugar since i felt it needed to balance the tartness that came from the granny smith apples. i used already made pies from the grocery's frozen section. A+ recipe..best of all so easy! will put this in my favorites!
315055,31128,2011-02-09,5,"This is like apple crisp in a pie shell, it's delicious!  I sometimes omit the caramel because it's just excess calories and tastes just as good without it.  Thanks so much for posting!"
768828,31128,2011-09-24,5,"I have been making apple pies for close to 60 years (I have an apple tree) and this is the best I've ever made.  The basic pie is pretty much how I make mine, but I think the caramel and pecans is what put it over the top.  I did double the pie recipe, but didn't double the crumb crust.  I put half on top of each pie.  It just seemed like too much.  Anyway it turned out perfectly and my DB is already asking for a second piece.  Thanks so much - I will be sure to keep caramel topping and pecans on hand just to make this pie."
294000,31128,2011-10-09,5,"I was in a hurry to make a dessert and had nothing but apples around. Found this, made recipe #51537 (My No Roll Pie Crust) for the crust and by the time it was out of the oven DH was back with the caramel topping. It was a huge hit and, thankfully, there was a small piece left for DD's school lunch as she'd asked me to save a piece when she saw how pretty the pie was out of the oven. We like crumb topping so it wasn't too much for us! Will definitely use this recipe often. Thanks!"
236170,31128,2011-10-15,5,I love this recipe because it combines apple pie and apple crisp with a yummy caramel topping. It tastes best with Granny Smith apples because they counteract the sweetness of the pie. I'm planning on making it again this week!
92816,31128,2011-11-06,5,This is the best apple pie I have ever made!It was so simple to make and tastes amazing!It's like an apple crumble pie.I also added 1/2 tsp cloves along with the cinnamon.The pecans on top taste even better when they're toasted for a few minutes.Delicious!!
103876,31128,2012-05-29,5,"My daughter made this for me for Mother's Day by my request.  I have had this recipe saved in my ""Want to Try"" cookbook for a long time and was waiting for the right occasion to try it.  I must say that it turned out perfect!  She loaded it up with lots of granny smith apples and added the topping and it was beautiful.  And the taste lived up to my expectations of how good it would be.  The filling was just the right sweetness and the streusel topping was fantastic.  I loved it so much that I have requested it for my birthday too, which is tomorrow.  This is by far my favorite apple pie.  Thanks for posting!"
142367,31128,2013-11-04,5,"With so many reviews, there isn&#039;t much more to say, except thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!"
839492,31128,2014-09-08,5,"This recipe doesn&#039;t need any more reviews, but I&#039;ll add that I made 2, they were excellent &amp; baking time ended up being a little longer. Allow the pie to cool before cutting."
1581225,31128,2017-05-07,5,Amazing! I can't believe I made something so good! I followed the recipe as directed and it came out perfect. A keeper for sure.
8688,20048,2002-03-26,5,"I made this wonderful recipe for my husband tonight and he said they have to be the best pork chops he has ever tasted!  I did everything exactly like the recipe called for and used Progresso Italian Style Bread Crumbs.  Thanks for the recipe, Donna!  I will definitly make this many, many more times!"
9869,20048,2002-05-02,5,"My husband asked if this was a 'zaar recipe, when I told him it was, he said give it 10 stars!!
The pork was lovely and tender, and the sage flavouring was wonderful. Love the crispiness of the egg, and cheese/crumb coating too. Thanks for posting.  =)"
7108,20048,2002-08-02,5,"Great breaded chops!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and only made 2 large chops.  I used dried lemon peel rather than the grated rind of lemon, same measurement."
27643,20048,2002-11-03,5,These are the tastiest pork chops ever!! I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and didn't change a thing. The sage Parmesan combo is very flavorful. Served with boiled new potatoes and lemon broccoli. Thank you Donna! This is definitely a keeper!!
47559,20048,2004-05-24,5,"This is a great recipe!  Very tasty. The breadcrumb mixture is outstanding.  It does make a lot more than you need, though.  Next time I'll make about half the amount of breadcrumb mixture, and make it fresh again for other uses.  Thanks for sharing this one!"
68960,20048,2005-02-06,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe, love the sage and lemon flavourings.  I breaded these in the morning, didn't cook them on the stove top but just popped them in the oven, covered for 15 min and then took the cover off so they could crisp up in the last 5-10 minutes.  Thanks for posting!"
37036,20048,2006-04-25,5,"These chops were moist and tender.  I liked the idea of browing them on the stove, yet finishing them off in the oven.  My only problem was that I didn't have an oven-safe skillet, so I preheated a glass baking dish in the oven while I browned the chops on the stove.  Then I just transfered them to the glass dish when it was time to put them in the oven.  Thanks Ron for a great recipe!"
177933,20048,2006-11-26,4,Easy to make and we enjoyed them.  I suggest making half of the breadcrumb mixture for 4 pork chops.  I like how the breading really stuck to the pork after being cooked.  Thanks!
394077,20048,2006-12-22,4,My daughter made this today. It came out tasty and tender.
207176,20048,2007-01-24,5,I really liked these. What can I say that hasn't been said? I especially loved the lemon zest and got to use a new citrus zester.  My kids were split on this dish. One is super picky so I took the breading off for him.  The other asked for some tomato sauce for dipping. Thanks for an easy and different flavored pork chop recipe!
92886,20048,2011-04-16,5,"Really good.  I think the sage and Parmesan made these so good.  I sliced a pork  loin into 1/2 inch slices, so mine cooked a bit more quickly."
147109,20048,2007-04-25,3,"These were okay, but not a favorite.  But I am not a big fan of pork chops to begin with.  I was looking for a recipe that I could use some pork chops up, and this was sufficient for the task, but kind of bland.  Thanks!"
439797,20048,2007-07-28,4,"Nice, but they ended up overcooked.  I needed to monitor the oven time closer."
169969,20048,2007-11-09,5,These were very good chops! I used fresh parmesan and followed the recipe to the letter. They came out perfect. I would make these again!
285039,20048,2007-11-13,4,"These were good, however, next time I will reduce the bread crumbs to 1 cup.  I think that will allow some of the other spices to come through better."
632249,20048,2007-11-14,3,We liked this but I found the chops were a bit dry.  I would try this again and maybe reduce the oven to 375. Thx for posting.
140132,20048,2008-01-19,5,"DIVINE.....these are awesome.  I made these last night for dinner and they were enjoyed by all.  The parmesan and sage are wonderful compliments to the pork.  I could also taste the lemon rind every once in a while, what a great treat.  I served these with hash brown potato casserole and broccoli.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe that will be made in our house forever.....Stephanie"
132383,20048,2008-01-27,5,Delicious pork chops! Made exactly as directed. Thanks for posting.
774665,20048,2008-03-23,5,These pork chops have great flavor. You must not omit the lemon rind--it makes this dish. I'll be making this one again and again! Great recipe.
158086,20048,2008-04-01,4,"Great recipe...we really enjoyed these pork chops, mine were pretty big so it took longer to cook, otherwise followed recipe to the letter..."
426903,20048,2008-09-01,5,"Very good pork chops. My husband and I were hesitant in trying different kinds of pork chops since we have already found our favorite.(Kind of like the saying if its not broke, don't fix it.) Fortunately this one was very similar to our favorite. Recipe #39023. This was a slightly different spin, but still very tasty. Thanks for posting!"
195589,20048,2009-01-28,5,"All I can say is WOW!! Make these now, you will not be sorry. I have made them twice now. The 2nd time I used Panko crumbs seasoned with some garlic powder and a dash of Italian Seasoning, which made for a nice thick crust. They are excellent BOTH ways, thanks so much for posting, Donna. I will make these over and over again!"
126440,20048,2009-02-17,5,I made half a recipe and it was easy to make and had great flavor.  I did double dip the pork chops as I had more egg and crumb mixture left. I did use panko crumbs rather than bread crumbs. It had a great crust and very tasty.  Served it with Recipe #105217.
68460,20048,2009-03-07,5,My husband loves bonless pork chops but I've never had much luck with cooking....they usually turn out too dry or just plain boring.  That said....we loved these pork chops!  I made them as written and they were perfect.  Thanks for the recipe Donna!
173579,20048,2009-03-09,5,Great way to cook pork chops.  So nice and juicy!  Flavor was fantastic.  Will use this recipe a lot.  Thanks for posting.
81611,20048,2009-03-18,4,Pretty good. It would have been good to know how much salt to dredge w/the flour; the parmesan  does add quite a bit of saltiness.
222564,20048,2010-04-19,5,"Love the flavors, lemon and sage with pork. Plenty crumbs though, was bit too dry and will reduce crumbs to 1 cup next time without reducing anything else."
203111,20048,2011-05-05,3,"Sorry but I was disappointed in this.  Scaled it down for 1 chop and mixed up 1/2 the amount of crumbs and still had excess crumbs, which I find very wasteful.  After cooking as directed, my thick, boneless chop was rather dry so if I would make this again I would reduce the heat to 375 and bake for 10 minutes on each side."
928301,20048,2011-12-08,4,good pork but you gotta be careful with the breadcrumb & cheese mixture--you don't need near that much to cover the pork.
55729,20048,2012-01-18,0,"I made quite a few changes to this recipe based on personal preference, ingredients on hand, and a ridiculous time crunch. I brined the pork first (1 1/2 qt water, 3 T salt, 1 hour) which I try to do for all pork dishes. I had economy chops and did not remove any fat; I scored the fat on the edges so the chops wouldn't curl. I used a combination of Italian flavored panko crumbs and regular panko crumbs because I was out of other bread crumbs. I also skipped the parmesan (I know, I know - it's even in the title) because what I had on hand was shredded rather than grated and I didn't want to waste it. (I would have just moved on to another recipe, but by that point I was completely out of time.) Also due to the time crunch I skipped both the flour and the egg steps and just put the wet chops in the crumbs, like you do with commercial Shake n Bake. I baked them on a wire rack over the pan and used a probe thermometer set to 150. I don't know how long they took, but it was quick and might have been close to the stated time. My family members seemed to like them, and they would probably rate my version 3* or 4*; I don't give stars when I screw a recipe up this badly. :)"
136997,20048,2012-05-14,5,"Nice chop recipe. I used a rib end cut. Loved what the lemon zest brings to the flavor. Forgot to add the Parmesan to the crumbs, so added it on top at the end. Oven temp. and time baked was spot on. :)"
203325,20048,2013-04-13,5,My daughter made these for dinner and they were delicious!!
1072593,20048,2014-11-08,5,"If salt and fat are wrong, parmesan sage pork chop doesn&#039;t want to be right. Fabulous!"
55578,33170,2003-03-29,5,Karen from TBay sent me this recipe and I love it! I love Caribbean food and this fits the bill!!
54678,33170,2003-04-14,5,So easy to prepare and flavours fabulous. Followed recipe exactly using chicken thighs. Keeper
59780,33170,2004-08-16,5,"Awesome flavour with very little effort. I used this to coat 10 chicken leg quarters and I let them sit all day in the fridge. I can't wait to try this with boneless chicken breasts. Thanks for this great recipe, we'll be using it again soon!"
135887,33170,2004-09-07,5,Excellent.  I left it in the refrigerator for 24 hours and the flavor was awesome!
173314,33170,2005-01-27,5,Deeelicious. I halved the cinnamon. Did on George foreman indoor grill about 6 minutes. Can't wait to use my leftovers in a salad wrap!
119466,33170,2005-01-30,5,"Loved the flavor! I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, doubled the cayenne pepper & marinated overnight. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!"
160974,33170,2005-03-02,5,"I baked these(400 degrees), due to ""gas shortage"" on our grill! They turned out moist and flavorful. The whole family enjoyed it, even two kids who are not too fond of baked chicken. I marinated these for two days, and I think that helped permeate the flavors. I'm going to make this a standby!

64203,33170,2005-06-09,5,"This was a great jerk chicken recipe. I love really spicy jerk chicken, but my kids won't eat that. So, this recipe is a nice comprise with a delicious blend of flavors that the entire family enjoys! Thanks!"
149363,33170,2005-06-22,5,"All I can say is WOW!!
This is an awesome dish.
I am low carbing, so I substituted a bit of Splenda in place of the brown sugar.
I marinated overnight, and it was fantastic, DH just LOVED it!
This will be added to my regular menu.
Thanks so much for a keeper!"
132383,33170,2005-07-31,5,I loved the flavor of this chicken. Thanks for posting.  We will definitely make this again.
203325,33170,2005-08-29,5,Made this last night for dinner and it was a hit with the family.  Next time I will add a little more red pepper (or maybe even red pepper flakes) for a little more kick.
52262,33170,2005-09-05,5,"Wow!  I haven't tried a chicken recipe with such great results in a long time!  I used 5 nice-sized boneless, skinless chicken breasts and the amount of marinade was just right.  I also only used 1/16 teaspoon of red pepper since I didn't want to make it too spicy for my kids.  It was the perfect amount for them.  For the adult preference, I would probably use 1/8 teaspoon red pepper.  If you like it really spicy, go for the full amount.  I will definitely be making this recipe again soon!"
68960,33170,2005-09-25,5,You can't get any easier than this.  I used boneless chicken thighs and cut them into 3. Marinated them overnight and cooked on the BBQ hotplate then finished off in the weber. Very tasty :)
222055,33170,2006-08-05,2,"
Taken from Southern Mama's review because we feel the same way-
""I have to say we didn't care for this too much. It was a very simple recipe but we didn't care for the flavor. It was not a bad flavor, just not something we like."" **** Adding to the quote- We also didn't like the texture of our chicken. I had doubled the recipe and cooked half in the oven after marinating for probably 2 hours and then cooked the other half on the grill after 24 hrs. I thought the grilled would be better, but it wasn't. So sorry, I really had high hopes due to the ratings."
172369,33170,2006-08-23,5,"Great recipe! made exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing, so easy and delicious. Thank you!"
187281,33170,2006-10-28,5,A must try!  This couldn't be any better if you like Jerk Chicken!  I have tried several jerk chicken recipes on Zaar and this is one of the very best!
347822,33170,2006-11-21,4,"Quick and easy.  I used chicken thighs with skin, marinated them overnight and put them in the oven for 45 mins at 375 (until the juices ran clear).  Next time, I may cut back on the sugar, use 1 tbsp of sugar instead of 2, some bites were a tad sweet. Thanks for the posting. Can't wait to try this in the summer and pop them on the grill."
37868,33170,2007-01-21,5,super great recipe..My family loved this. I also doubled the recipe...I just knew it was going to be great. However I did leave out the cinnamon. I cooked it on the grill. Wonderful smells came from my back yard. Hugs
402559,33170,2007-02-23,5,"Oh my goodness what a fantastic flavor! Served with coconut sweet potatoes, pineapple slaw and sweet rolls. YUMM! Thanks for sharing."
146486,33170,2007-06-01,5,Fantastic flavor and so juicy!  I omitted the red pepper and used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I baked at 400 for 30 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  Great recipe...can't wait to try it on the grill next!!
185446,33170,2007-07-21,5,"I like to try first-time recipes as they are, but another reviewer's wrap idea sounded interesting, so I opted to go that route. They were okay, but I think my family would have enjoyed the meat much more with no additions, to better savor the chicken's wonderful flavor.  Thanks, princess buttercup--your recipe is great just as it is."
125640,33170,2007-08-11,3,"Very quick and easy and all ingredients I had on hand, but the skin of the chicken burnt even over low heat on my grill. We had to peel off the skin which would have had all the flavor in it because it just tasted like charcoal. The meat itself was tender and juicy though and I still think we'll really like the flavor from the marinade if I can find a way to get it not to burn. Thanks for sharing."
251626,33170,2007-09-22,5,Very moist and the perfect amount of flavour.
140132,33170,2008-01-08,5,"OMG.....I loved this dish.  The simplicity of this with the flavor, makes this a winning recipe.  I love jerk and this is a hit.  I plan on making this tomorrow night again (I'm playing catch up on my reviews) served with rice and a veggie.  Thank you for this great recipe.....Stephanie"
666723,33170,2008-01-21,5,"This chicken is so very good!  I didn't have thyme, so instead I added some italian spices.  I absolutely loved the cinnamon flavor and couldn't imagine decreasing it.  I was only making two large chicken breasts, but kept the amount of everything else the same and it made a nice drizzle for the rice I served under it (easy garlic rice #71739) and can't wait to make this again.  I cooked the chicken in the oven, uncovered, at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  Half way through I basted the chicken with the leftover marinade.  Super tasty."
33159,33170,2008-01-27,4,"This is a really good, spicy-sweet juicy chicken.  My marinade wasn't quite pourable - it was almost a paste.  I followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure if I used the wrong size dressing mix or what.  I did substitute 1/2 tsp chipotle powder for the ground red pepper because I wasn't sure what it was."
76951,33170,2008-03-29,5,This was VERY good and I WILL be making this over and over again.
489552,33170,2008-05-27,5,"My daughter loves jerk/cajun chicken anything Jamican/Caribbean.  This was really good and easy.  She will have me do it again soon.
Thank you for sharing your recipe."
499050,33170,2008-06-29,3,Good.
55729,33170,2009-04-04,3,"I doubled this recipe but was out of cinnamon, so it had half or less as much cinnamon as it should. The flavor was good and penetrated the meat well. However, it caused massive flare-ups on the grill, so the outside was burned."
426903,33170,2009-04-17,5,I marinated this over night and it was packed with flavor. We will try this again!! Thanks for posting!
177933,33170,2009-05-17,5,Just one more glowing review!  I cut my chicken breasts into tenders and marinated for about 2 hours.  Couldn't have been easier and tasted wonderful!  Thanks!!
264017,33170,2009-05-25,5,"Add me to the list of lovers for this recipe (#131)! The ingredients went together in a flash for a quick 1 hour marinade. I used a full 2.5 lb. bag of chicken breasts. It didn't seem like much marinade, but it covered them all completely. We loved it and will enjoy this many times. Thanks princess!"
142335,33170,2009-06-29,4,This was really good. To me it didn't taste very jerk-ish but we enjoyed it just the same. I used 3 breasts but kept the marinade amount the same. Marinated 7 hours then grilled. I'll make this again...next time I will add jalapeno or habanero (which ever peppers I have on hand) to the mix. Thanks for sharing.
189475,33170,2009-09-16,5,Excellent! I marinated for 2 hours and grilled on my George Foreman Grill.
173579,33170,2012-08-03,5,This chicken had wonderful flavor.  It was so quick and easy to fix.  DH just loved it.  Thanks for posting.
8688,73469,2003-11-11,5,"This is an excellent pumpkin bread! I love the addition of the apple which gives it a superbly moist texture.  There isn't a thing I would change about this recipe!  I am enjoying one loaf and am freezing the other for later use!  Thanks so much, Kree for sharing this wonderfully delightful recipe!"
7108,73469,2003-12-07,5,"I have to admit, I did not make this bread or try it.  But I passed this one on to a co-worker who was looking for a bread to take to a Thanksgiving dinner.  She made it and reported back to me with rave reviews.  I can't wait to make it myself!"
39835,73469,2004-11-19,5,Delicious and smells wonderful when cooking! I used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat (in place of the 3 cups white flour) when I made it and I also used apple cider in place of the apple juice with wonderful results. We had this with Crockpot Beans n' Wieners recipe#62917 for a wonderful fall week-night supper. Thanks for sharing!
188119,73469,2005-07-19,5,"What a gread bread! It smelled delicious while cooking in the oven.  Everyone who tried it thoght it was really great.  I probably doubled the cinnamon in the recipe, but other than that it was spectacular.  Thanks!"
98919,73469,2005-09-13,5,"This recipe was wonderful!!  Very good and so moist!  I didn't have an apple juice, so substituted sweetened applesauce.  If my grandkids will eat it, then it is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!"
329638,73469,2006-10-16,5,"I took a lot of liberties with this recipe, and it is still incredible!  In an effort to try to make the recipe just a little healthier for my family, I used whole wheat flour, equal instead of sugar, applebutter in place of apples (we were out of apples and also to cut down the oil), apple cider in place of the juice, 3 eggs (becasue that's all I had) and only a splash of oil.  I also used a teaspoon of maple extract, just for the heck of it, and made these into muffins instead of loaves.  Holy cow, these are incredible!  The second batch is in the oven now, and my kids keep wandering in and commenting on how good it smells, and wandering back out with yet another muffin in their hands! Thanks for such  great recipe! "
37779,73469,2007-01-23,5,"This is one outstanding quick bread. The flavor is perfectly spiced and the smell is very compelling. 'Supremely moist' as Bev put it and truly one of the best quick breads I have tried. I shredded a Granny Smith apple and from a texture standpoint--couldn't tell it was in there. But the flavor was definitely there. Kree, thanks for sharing an excellent recipe."
251917,73469,2007-09-23,5,Outstanding!!
218535,73469,2008-01-22,5,Yummy! Better the next day. I used Granny Smith apple in my bread.
140132,73469,2008-02-21,5,"So good.  I made these Sunday morning and we had one loaf for breakfast.  The flavors went great together.  Yummm.  I sent second loaf with DS to college and ""the guys"" ate it in one sitting...lol.  Thank you for this lovely pumpkin bread that will be make often in my house."
774665,73469,2009-06-05,5,Very moist and my kids and my husband give it five stars. I wouldn't change a thing.
402559,73469,2009-11-02,5,"I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup butter instead of the oil and 2 apples instead of 1. This was my favorite that I made out of all of them. Really good flavor, very moist. Will make often, thanks!"
174991,73469,2009-11-08,5,"This is a wonderful moist bread that smelled great while it was baking.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour.  The sugar was divided between sugar and Splenda.  The next time I will reduce the amount of sugar.  I also divided the oil with 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  Finally used
Egg Beaters instead of eggs.  The muffins baked in about 30 minutes.  It's a keeper."
124190,73469,2010-08-09,5,"This was really good. I only got one loaf, so I don't know how mini loaves would work. I suppose it would depend on the size of the loaf pan. Easy to make, tastes great, and a great way to use up my last can of pumpking before I stock up again. Thanks for posting!"
315055,73469,2010-10-13,4,"The bread was moist and sweet which I thought was great, however I think it called for too much oil.  The oil flavor was overpowering IMHO, and I would half it should I ever make this again.  Either that or figure out a way to sub in applesauce for the oil completely."
389431,73469,2010-10-15,5,OMG this is good!!! All things autumn in one heavenly slice...  Thanks so very much!!
146486,73469,2010-10-25,5,This is a wonderful bread and perfect for fall.  I couldn't find my loaf pans so I baked in a 9x13 pan for 55 minutes.  I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil rather than the full cup of oil and used red delicious apples.  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe!!
540346,73469,2012-12-18,5,"This bread is awesome, and what is even better is that you get 2 full loaves!  It is moist and flavorful.  I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and added an extra apple for a total of 2 chopped apples.  I topped mine with a simple glaze.  This would make wonderful gifts for the Christmas and Thanksgiving season.  The glaze I made was 1 c powdered sugar, 3 tbsp whipping cream, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  The I put it in a ziplock bag with the corner trimmed and piped it on.  This was delicious and I will be making again."
27643,25723,2002-08-21,5,"I started with 3 tubes of crescent rolls. Cut each of the rolled up cinnamon rolls in 3 pieces. I then put them in a 13x9 baking pan. They were probably bigger than the original ones. But! That didn't make them last any longer!! These can vanish right before your eyes! They were absolutely yummy!! Such an easy way to get such a great treat! Thanks Nurse Di, these will be a regular here."

37305,25723,2003-08-21,5,"WOW!  These were sooooo great!  Very easy and tasted terrific!  The whole family loved them and they looked and tasted like they were more work than they really were!  I was unsure how to space them in the cake pan and at first had them all touching eachother.  Then, when they did not fill the pan, I just evenly spaced them...glad I did, because they needed room to ""grow"".  I also spread a bit of melted butter before sprinkling with cinnamon and sugar.  Thanks for sharing...this is such a great idea!"
42720,25723,2004-02-07,5,"Well add me to the list of people who love these Tiny Cinnamon Rolls!!  I used 2 tubes of crescent roll dough and doubled the remaining ingredients.  It just doesn't get much easier than this, but the best thing is they taste like you worked all morning in the kitchen.  :)   "
37036,25723,2004-05-23,4,"Nice and easy recipe!  I followed your directions, except that I cut each roll into 6 instead of 5.  The family loved them.  I will be making these again!"
173314,25723,2004-11-20,4,Thanks for such a quick and inexpensive breakfast treat! My kids loved them.  I use a cheaper (in dairy case) buttermilk biscuit and just flatten them out like a rectangle. will be a regular weekend morning treat.
176615,25723,2004-11-30,5,I was running late this morning and had these on the table for breakfast in less than 20 minutes! My kids thought they were wonderful. The recipe could easily be doubled and put in a 9-inch cake pan. Thanks for a great quick recipe!
172369,25723,2005-02-13,5,My 14 year old made these all by himself and loved them. What a great recipe.Thanks

29782,25723,2005-08-14,5,I am so glad I found this recipe. Its great! So easy and so delicious. Great little sweet snack to have on a spur of the moment. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I will be making these alot!! :)
146486,25723,2005-12-05,5,"Made these to go in my Christmas tins this year and ended up eating a lot of them!  Very good recipe and just the perfect size for snacking.  I used more sugar and cinnamon than called for but besides that, made as directed.  Thanks for a neat recipe!"
47907,25723,2005-12-26,5,"I made these a few times several years ago and forgot about them until I saw this recipe.  I made them for Christmas breakfast and they were as wonderful as I remembered them.  They are very easy to make especially on a busy morning.  I made as posted except I got about 6-7 rolls out of each ""tube"" and I baked them in a 9x9 square pan.  Thanks for posting a keeper!"
22015,25723,2006-01-08,4,"I'm giving the recipe 4 stars because I like the concept and the flavor but I did have a couple of problems.   First of all, with most cinnamon roll recipes you ""crowd"" the rolls in the pan to help them raise.   The recipe as written only filled about half of my pan that way.   Second of all the times seem to be way off.   I will however play with this some more because I like the concept so much."
278113,25723,2006-01-08,5,"These were so easy, and sooo yummy! I baked them for 10 mind in my oven, and it was perfect. Added a TBsp or so of cream cheese to the icing mix..and YUMMAH! Both kids and hubby scarfed them down, mumbling how wonderful they were the whole time. Thanks for sharing this recipe, we will make this again and again! So easy, my teenager will be making this one often, I can tell! "
101823,25723,2006-01-28,5,"Excellent little morning treats.  I originally prepared them for a morning breakfast party featuring finger foods.  They were so quick and easy that I immediately added them to my list of simple, but tasty breakfast treats and prepared them for my visiting nephew.  Everyone provides rave reviews.  I did have to bake for about 20 minutes instead of 12, but that could be my oven variation."
51011,25723,2006-04-09,4,Made a 1/2 batch of these for breakfast.  Made the 4 squares into 2 rectangles and rolled them up.  I agree with some of the other posters that they are not quite sweet enough- but perhaps they would have been sweeter if I had used the glaze (I am out of powdered sugar)  Next time I may add some brown sugar with the cinnamon sugar mixture as well.  Thanks for sharing such a simple recipe!
140806,25723,2006-04-27,5,A great late night treat for DH and me! They were simple and tasty. I like mine extra sweet so I put a little extra sugar inside and topped with extra glaze. Yum!
125640,25723,2006-06-09,2,"After more than 100 people have ranted about how great these are, I kind of hate to be the first person to really say that they weren't impressed, but I just wasn't. The rolls themselves were easy enough to make and tasted good enough on their own that they'd make a nice quick little snack if you're not expecting anything spectacular. I did like the fact that they weren't as sweet as a lot of cinnamon rolls, maybe with some finely chopped walnuts and/or raisins sprinkled on top of the cinnamon/sugar layer before you roll them up, they could be really good. The frosting on the other hand didn't work very well and was actually (and again sorry) just kind of disgusting. 1 tsp of milk was just enough to make some of the powdered sugar clump together a bit. I had to add about a tablespoon before it turned into anything that vaguely resembled frosting and it was still pretty thick for cinnamon rolls at that. It tasted exactly like barely liquified powdered sugar, so I was glad I tasted it before I actually ruined the rolls by putting it on. The stuff we make for the cinnamon rolls at work is powdered sugar and melted butter (not sure what the proportions would be on a scale this small) with a little bit of vanilla and cinnamon and just enough coffee to make it the right consistency. It's rich and delicious and oozes just perfectly into all the nooks and crannies and I think maybe it just ruined this frosting for me by comparison. All in all this recipe was okay and it has some potential, but I just can't see what everyone's so excited about."
218535,25723,2006-07-03,4,These were easy and delicious. Not as sweet as the store bought ones (which is a good thing.) I did not give it 5-star because the 8 inch round pan was way too big for the rolls. I have to bake mine for about 15 minutes and used 2 teaspoons of milk for the glaze.
140132,25723,2006-12-15,5,"Even though I made this a few weeks ago, I can still almost smell these little jewels...mmmmm.  They were so simple and quick to put together I will be making them often.  I added some finely chopped pecans in mine and we loved it.  Thank you for a yummy and quick treat....Stephanie"
158086,25723,2006-12-29,5,I make these with splenda and they turned out wonderful....
316717,25723,2007-05-03,5,no kidding are these tiny! but really cute and next time i really have to double the recipe because these go too fast and are easy to demolish. very easy and will most definately make again and again.
74281,25723,2007-07-10,5,"I have to add to the masses of others who LOVE these little cinnamon rolls. They are really easy to make and so good! The only problem I had was my own, and that is that my big ol' hands had trouble cutting each log into 5 pieces, so I cut them into 4 pieces!"
529278,25723,2007-09-04,4,"Good taste, although not as sensational as I would have thought based on the ratings.   Be sure not to sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mix too close to the edge, because they stay rolled better if there is a bit of plain dough.  Also, I thought I had pinched my seams together well, but I hadn't, and that made things more difficult!  I made double the cinnamon-sugar mix, but didn't use quite all of it.  I did as some others suggested and just used store-bought cream cheese frosting.  I'm not sure these were any better than store-bought rolls, but I really liked how they were bite-sized.  Made me feel like I was getting more!  That's also nice when you are making a lot for breakfast and just want a sampling of everything you make."
229524,25723,2007-10-10,5,"How fun easy and cute are these :) My DH, DD and myself loved these. My DH called them M & M's and wanted to know where DD and myself share was (lol). Will be making these often.  I did have to use more than 1 teaspoon of milk.  The 1 teaspoon just wet the powdered sugar a little."
373817,25723,2007-11-20,5,"These are delicious!! I like these better than the other refrigerated cinnamon rolls! My toddler is on his third one already. I think the next time I may use orange juice in the glaze instead of milk. Thanks for this great, quick recipe!"
39301,25723,2008-02-24,5,Fantastic and soooo simple!  My kids love these rolls.  Thanks for postin ghere.
461834,25723,2008-03-12,5,"This gets  5 stars just for the simplicity and taste!!!  So easy to make, as 15 yo DS just loves cinnamon rolls.  I did spread a little of butter on the rolls first, and then I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I also doubled the amount of sugar and cinnamon.  My DS loves the Cinnabon rolls/frosting so I found a copycat for the frosting, but didn't to go through the work of kneading/rising of the dough.  He ate almost the full 8 oz. Thanks for posting such a quick and wonderful recipe!!!!"
93006,25723,2008-03-19,5,"Yum, yum, yum!  These are irresistible!  Made exactly as written except that one tube of crescents did not fill up my cake pan - darn it! I had to open another tube to fill the pan - doubled the icing and the 40 rolls fed 3 of us! :)  Thanks, Di!"
229850,25723,2008-06-04,5,"These were so easy and very tasty ! Loved them! Thankyou so much, I even used the already made  mixture of sugar and cinnamon that made it even easier, if that is possible !"
121185,25723,2009-04-13,5,These were great!  I ended up using 4 tubes in a 9x13 and had to cook it for about 20+ minutes but I think they were a bit too squished together when done.  Next time I'll use 3 tubes and give them a little breathing room.
242484,25723,2009-09-09,4,"For a quick cinnamon roll, these are nice."
285039,25723,2011-12-25,5,I made a double batch of these Christmas morning and my family loved them!  Quick and easy when you don't have time to make from scratch; this semi-homemade version is definitely better than the canned or frozen variety!  This will be our new Christmas morning treat!
39835,104628,2004-12-19,5,Delicious and so easy! I used a bit extra garlic powder and misread the directions so I brushed the breadsticks with melted butter and spinkled with cheese before baking and then I brushed them with butter again after baking--they were so good! Thanks for sharing this super easy way to make delicious bread sticks!
176615,104628,2005-01-07,5,"I've made this a couple of times and the whole family enjoys them. A nice and easy accompaniment to just about any meal. Seasonings are good without being overpowering. For variety, a little garlic salt subbed for the sprinkling of parmesan is yummy. Thanks, Marie!"
29782,104628,2005-04-01,5,Excellent!!Very easy to make up. DH and I really enjoyed these with our lunch today! Its a keeper in my cookbook Marie! Thank you so much for sharing!
64934,104628,2005-05-04,5,"These bread sticks were wonderful!  The only problem I had (like somebody else mentioned) was that they wouldn't stay ""twisted"", but they did turn out delicious in spite of it.   I baked them for exactly 15 minutes and they were just right!  I'll certainly be making these again the next time we have a pasta dish.  Thanks Marie!"
68960,104628,2005-07-10,5,"Great recipe. I really can't add more than what the other reviewers have already stated. Will definitly have some of these on hand in the freezer. Thanks Marie, we love your bread recipes."
64203,104628,2005-09-07,5,"These are delicious! Another winner Marie :)
I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't twist my dough.. I just made them into long straight ropes. I added butter, parmesan and garlic salt after baking for 12 minutes and they turned out almost exactly like the breadsticks from the Olive Garden. Deliicous, soft and flavorful!"
169969,104628,2005-11-18,5,These were perfect! I followed the recipe exactly except I braided them. They came out wonderful! Thanks Marie!
37305,104628,2005-12-07,5,"Marie, these were incredibly awesome!  I served them with stuffed shells and they were just perfect.  I twisted two pieces together to make braids, so I ended up with 12.  They didn't look like they doubled even after 35 minutes of rise time, but after baking they were nicely risen and soft.  I baked them for about 20 minutes.  The whole family agreed these were the best.  Thanks for posting!"
103876,104628,2005-12-31,5,These were delicious breadsticks.  I served them with soup and salad and everyone loved it!
125640,104628,2006-01-06,5,I made these to go with Chicken Parmesan & Roasted Asparagus. They were my husband's favorite part of what turned out to be an incredible meal. The only changes I made were to substitute Splenda for 1/2 of the sugar and wheat flour for 1/3 of the bread flour. Delicious. Thanks a bunch.
52125,104628,2006-01-21,5,"Excellent recipe! They turned out perfect and tasted just as good.
Thanks Marie...."
173579,104628,2006-04-12,5,This was a very good bread recipe.  Rveryone liked them.  Thanks for posting.
231054,104628,2006-07-02,5,"It's doesn't look like this needs another 5 star review -- but it deserves it!!!  Made these yesterday.  I do have a bread machine -- but it's stuck way, way back in the cupboard, plus it would take a week for me to dig out the instruction booklet, so I used my mixer to whip these up.  I let the dough raise once, punched it down and then made the bread sticks.  Then let them rise before baking.  I only got 16 bread sticks -- and didn't twist or braid them (running short on time), but after the way they turned out, don't think I'll do that in future batches either.  These were just so yummy -- hard to stop eating them.  It's 9:00 a.m. and there are only TWO bread sticks left (and it's just me and my husband in the house) -- oh, and one 20 year old cat (guess I'll blame their disappearance on her)!!!  I'm already being asked to make another batch of these today!  Thank you, Marie for posting this recipe."
147109,104628,2006-07-31,5,"One more five star review!  I loved these!  I twisted, just to do something different, and they were gobbled up fast!  Thanks!"
394077,104628,2007-01-09,5,"Delish! I used regular flour and they still came out wonderful. My daughter ate 6 pieces coming out of the oven, my DH loves these so much he ate them with chinese food and with breakfast."
222970,104628,2007-11-23,5,The PERFECT recipe. Can't say more than that!
177933,104628,2007-12-19,5,"Easy and wonderful!  I made 16 big fluffy sticks.  Thanks Marie, your recipes never dissapoint."
402559,104628,2008-02-14,5,"This dough was really easy to work with, they had a fantastic flavor and they baked up perfectly soft and chewy. Will definitely make again, thanks!"
318235,104628,2008-11-06,4,Flavor was pretty good but I had a little trouble getting mine to rise and I unfortunately over cooked them as directed not too! Will try them again though as I saw the potential and they all disappeared on pasta night despite the set-backs.
126440,104628,2009-04-11,5,Excellent breadsticks.  I just need to be able to make them smaller.  Great flavor and so easy using the ABM.  Served them with Recipe #126611.
928301,104628,2010-04-01,3,"They had an interesting flavor, but nothing compared to the spectacular reviews everybody else made.  I don't know how they got theirs to taste like Olive Gardens.  That would be a real treasure."
329638,104628,2011-03-19,0,"two thumbs way up!  Whole family loved these- perfect, soft, delicious!"
50969,104628,2011-05-19,4,"I made this recipe on 3/10/11 to go with the Italian Meatball Soup that was being made for dinner.Except for cutting in half this recipe was made as written.Both my SO and I thought the breadsticks were pretty good. Thanks for posting and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
187373,104628,2011-09-16,4,These were pretty good breadsticks--light and soft! Brought for a girl's night out dinner with friends where they were enjoyed.  Quite easy to make with my breadmaker.  Although I will say mine did not look nearly as pretty as the picture! :) Have the other half in the freezer to pull out to complete a quick weeknight Italian meal.  Edit to add:  They freeze well!
140132,104628,2012-02-14,5,These are FANTASTIC!  I made them last night for our Italian dinner and we loved them.  My niece and nephew came over and they ate about 3 apiece.  Thank you for this great new food item we will make often.
400708,104628,2016-07-03,5,"The BEST, that's the comment from my picky eater nephew who likes almost nothing. I have to agree, soft pillow crumb, with the flavors of the brushed on butter n spices. Made it exactly as directed in the ABM so couldn't have been easier, served them with scallops and pasta and it was the perfect bread. I'm betting this one is going to make all our Italian meals in the future"
305531,13483,2009-05-28,5,I loved this! I made a smaller portion and loved the smell of garlic while this was cooking. I added a little dash of parsley at the end. Thanks Mirj for a nice keeper. Made for ZWT5 2009.
240552,294000,2008-04-02,5,We love these gems!!  I divided one up between the kids and they wanted more.  LOL!  Thanks for the great recipe!
27643,16371,2002-01-04,5,Tried this for supper tonight and it was wonderful. Easy to make. Very flavorful. Will be making this again!!
13483,16371,2003-12-12,5,This is becoming an all time favourite . . . and understandably so!!  Good and easy to do.  I did add some grated cheese and tabasco though.
81611,16371,2004-02-16,5,"I've always loved chimichangas, but never dreamed I could make them at home! These are great. Big hit with DH; next time it will be a double batch. I used gr buffalo, tomato tortillas, brushed w/olive oil, and served with mozzarella cheese (that's all I had!), green onions, black olives, lettuce and sour cream. Thanks!"
91392,16371,2004-02-24,4,"A nice recipe, I really liked the meat filling, will use it for tacos and other things.  I filled 8 tortillas, but not with a third cup, much less.  Good recipe, will use again!"
46660,16371,2004-04-06,5,"These were tasty!  I used whole wheat tortillas, and added a splash of Emeril's seasoning.  I also used olive oil (except I found that I only needed 1/6 cup to baste all of them generously after putting them in the pan), and sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top in the last few minutes of baking.  The kids loved them, which is a big plus.  With the cheese, they are only 7 points on Weight Watchers, which for me, is a HUGE plus!  Thanks for the recipe!"
180090,16371,2005-04-10,4,"These were great, healthier than real chimichangas. Meat filled six tortillas. Makes a yummy, fast, easy dinner. Thank you!"
187281,16371,2005-09-02,5,"Well, what can I say that everyone else hasn't covered.  These are very good, kid-friendly and a snap to get on the table.  I switch between cheddar and mozzarella cheese (or a blend) because my family loves mozzarella cheese on everything! It doesn't get much better for ease and taste!  Thanks for sharing!"
119466,16371,2005-11-11,5,"These were easy, quick and very good! I ended up with only 6 and also had quite a bit of butter left over, so next time I will melt less. I had to fight the urge to use olive oil instead of butter, but the butter really did give them a nice flavor and crisp outside. I followed the directions, except I didn't use Pace brand picante sauce (used a hot garlic chipotle salsa and used a bit more than called for) and my meat was rinsed as it was ground sirloin I had already browned, rinsed and frozen for a future quick meal. My family loved them--I very rarely fry, so this is as close to the real thing as they will get at home. :) Thanks for posting the recipe!"
158086,16371,2006-07-11,5,We loved these...so simple but very tasty...I added some enchilada sauce and cheese after baking and stuck back in oven until cheese melted....will make again I am sure
68884,16371,2006-10-25,4,"We enjoyed this as a weeknight meal, topped with sour cream & more salsa and served with spanish rice. I used whole-wheat tortillas and added twice the cumin and some chili powder, and I added about 1 Tbsp shredded cheddar inside with the meat mixture before I folded it up. The cooking is right-on to get the chimichangas pretty crisp considering they're baked. :)  I will definitely make these again, probably using half ground beef and half black beans."
185285,16371,2006-11-13,5,"Please don't laugh..but DH's benchmark for great food is his all-time favorite: Tacos.  This is the first dish I've made since we've been married that ""is even better than tacos!"".  I about fell over.  Hey... I guess you could say he's easy to please?  I've also done a variation using taco seasoning when I was out of herbs, which worked very well here.  "
232480,16371,2007-01-01,5,"These were VERY good - I followed this recipe to the letter except I used a different brand of picante sauce.  I got 8 chimichangas out of this recipe.  Took a few more minutes in my oven to brown them, but that's probably because my oven is very old and doesn't hold heat very well anymore."
103876,16371,2007-01-28,4,I made these tonight for dinner and we enjoyed them.  I think next time I will add some enchilada sauce and cheese on the top for more flavor.
140132,16371,2007-02-01,5,"These were very good.  I love chimis and these are even better because they are baked, not fried.  I served them with rice and beans.  I also had some shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes , sliced green onions and sour cream and salsa to serve along side of these.  I will definately make these again. Thank you for a lovely dinner......Stephanie"
8688,16371,2007-03-19,5,"Delicious! Very easy to put together for a great supper! Thank you, Mysterygirl!"
44383,16371,2007-03-29,5,"I know I've already reviewed this recipe and said it was delish! That's still true. However I've made it a few times now and the last time I made it, I tried following the recipe exactly and instead of using olive oil to brush the tortilla's, I used the butter as the recipe called for. TERRIBLE!! The tortilla's came out dry and crumbly. I strongly suggest the olive oil instead."
125640,16371,2007-07-26,5,Made exactly as directed. Very easy and very good. Thanks for sharing.
377581,16371,2008-02-08,5,"These were very good and so easy to make. I served them with refried beans. Thank you for posting, definately a keeper!"
136997,16371,2008-02-17,5,"Very easy and tasty dish. I only got 6 out of the filling to serve 3 people. Next time I'll just increase the amounts slightly to serve 4, because you can't just eat one per person you know. :)"
499050,16371,2008-05-22,5,Yum!
368078,16371,2008-08-22,5,Yum!  We've never made Chimichangas and these were SO GOOD!  The only changes we made were to add ground turkey instead of the beef and to put cheddar cheese on the top for the last 3-4 minutes of cooking.  Wonderful!!!  We served with refried beans and rice.
74281,16371,2009-01-19,5,"What a nice and easy meal these made! I used Low-Carb whole wheat tortillas and put cheese in before I rolled them. We topped them with lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and taco sauce and they were loved by all! It is nice to have a meal like this even when you are watching your carbs, so everyone in the family thanks you for the recipe Mystergirl!!"
286851,16371,2009-06-07,4,"These were so easy to make, with common pantry ingredients. We really enjoyed them and will make again. Followed the recipe as directed."
242484,16371,2009-06-07,5,"Oh man, these were great! I added a little shredded cheddar cheese to each of mine before rolling up. The leftovers made great hot pockets the next day. just 30 seconds in the microwave!"
389431,16371,2010-01-28,5,"These are great! Easy too!
I skipped the butter and sprayed on some Canola - also added some cheese to the mix and made a queso sauce for the top! FABULOUS!"
54678,16371,2010-03-31,5,KEEPER!KEEPER! First time round followed recipe exact and it was a big hit with ladies craft group. Few nites later was mexican supper with friends and I brushed them with the oliver oil as suggested and did one batch with addition of cheese and the second batch was made with half ground beef and half homemade chorizo. AWESOME! Leftovers were just as delicious and I'm going to try freezing some.
191533,16371,2010-08-01,4,"These are very easy. I did not find the flavor outstanding, however. I added cheese inside each chimi and served with sour cream. I bet a little refried beans inside each one would be delicious."
15521,16371,2010-10-14,4,"Very flexible and quick recipe.  I cooked the meat mixture ahead of time. Baked in my toaster oven, adding a little cheese on top at the end. Perhaps because I cooked mine in the toaster oven, they browned rather quickly.  Next time I might try baking at a bit lower temperature, but I think that was due to using my toaster oven rather than a regular oven. They were nice in that people could add the toppings they liked. Might try adding refried beans inside the chimichanga next time along with the meat."
64203,16371,2014-04-15,5,I&#039;m always looking for quick and simple weeknight dinner ideas using ground beef. This will be made time and time again! So good! Thanks for the recipe.
7108,35988,2002-11-04,5,"Wow, a great tasting, quickly prepared soup that tastes homemade.  I used a 9 oz package of low fat 4 cheeses refrigerated ravioli and used a can of Contadina Italian diced tomatoes, and served this with warm garlic breadsticks.  Delicious, thanks for posting!"
39835,35988,2006-01-29,4,Very good but I also thought it had a bit too much spinach--next time I will cut down the spinach a lot and use more tomatoes instead. Thanks for sharing!
101823,35988,2006-11-02,5,"Wonderful soup.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil instead of the whole tomatoes.  We loved the flavor of this soup and will make it often.  Update 11-2-06:  I prepared this adding some browned and crumbled Italian sausage for an Autumn party.  It was a hit among everyone, but the men really enjoyed the sausage in the soup."
136997,35988,2006-11-28,5,This was delicious and a snap to pull together. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole and I did add a bit of basil and oregano along with some sausage meat. Lovely flavors. :)
280166,35988,2006-12-10,4,"Quick, easy and fairly healthy.  I added about 1/2 lb hot italian turkey sausage left from breakfast.  Also used diced tomatoes.  Thanks for posting!"
135887,35988,2007-01-28,5,"This soup is delicious!  I used 6 cups of chicken broth and 9 oz. of tortellini.  I also added some basil and left out the parmesan.  Quick, easy and yummy!"
222564,35988,2007-02-04,4,"Simple is best! Really easy and tasty soup in no time at all. Cheese tortellinis go well in this recipe. I used only the 4 cups broth but we thought it was little watery, though, and would add some tomato paste next time, to give it little more body. Cheese is must and we use more garlic, too."
68884,35988,2007-05-11,5,"I knew this would be a good, healthy soup - I didn't know that such simple ingredients would make such a great flavor! I used 4 cups of frozen Recipe #171834, and followed the recipe exactly. DH - a big fan of meat - ate 3 bowls!! I'll add this easy, healthy, delicious dish to my weeknight go-to file. :)"
160974,35988,2007-05-23,5,"I chose this for our Sunday lunch. I loved how you didn't have to cook the noodles separately, since it really made the cooking go fast. I used 6 cups broth  (including 2 cups water mixed with chicken boullion) and fresh spinach. Served with wheat bread broiled with butter and parmesan. I will keep these ingred. in the pantry for when I need a quick dinner.  Thanks Spatchcock, for posting.

Update: my daughter has requested this recipe again so it's going to be a family favorite.

439797,35988,2007-10-03,5,Loved it!  We ate about half and have frozen the rest for later.
54678,35988,2007-10-21,5,this was the first time we cooked with tortellini and ours was a 3 cheese which went great with the spinach. Subbed in a can diced tomatoes and used our fresh turkey broth.
222433,35988,2007-12-27,5,Really good! My family liked this because it is not too tomato-y. Very subtle. A definite make again!!
158086,35988,2008-05-19,5,"Loved this soup, it was so simple.  I did add an 8oz. can of tomato sauce as I had a little more chicken broth then the recipe called for...great fast soup recipe."
93006,35988,2009-02-28,4,Very tasty but best of all a quick and easy meatless meal.  A good recipe to keep on hand when you need something hearty and quick!
808027,35988,2009-04-30,5,"Great soup and so healthy!  I make this for lunch a lot as I love soup, 24/7.  Great flavors.  I don't think it needs the parmesan cheese but that's personal preference.  Added some dried basil but next time I'll add fresh chopped basil just before serving.  Also used low sodium chicken broth to reduce the salt content.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Just perfect."
426903,35988,2010-01-10,5,"This was delicious! The only change I made was using a can of diced tomatoes with celery and onions since I did not have the whole ones. I will definitely make this again, thanks for posting!"
307214,35988,2010-01-16,4,"Although this was very good, we felt that a whole package of spinach was just a little much.  Maybe 1/2 a package next time?"
126440,35988,2010-10-01,5,"Wonderful soup.  DH said a 10, he loved the tortellini and fresh spinach.  I'm sure he will want this one often."
140132,35988,2010-10-25,5,What a great recipe.  I made this for DH and myself for supper tonight and we really enjoyed this.  I did add a pound of mild italian sausage browned up and used tomato sauce in place of the whole tomatoes (thought I had some but didn't)and I used cheese tortellinis.  We loved the soup and I know my kids will too.  I'm already looking forward to lunch tomorrow for the leftovers.  Thank you for sharing this with us.
55729,35988,2010-11-17,4,"This was the easiest soup I have ever made, and very quick (I found myself almost over-simmering it to try to get some dishes done!). I used dry cheese tortellini which was only an 8 oz. package, chicken broth, and fresh spinach. We topped the soup with mozzerella cheese because I was out of parmesan, but that was a bit too bland. I used diced tomatoes because the stores here have stopped selling small cans of whole tomatoes. I had to stretch to get 5 servings out of this - it seems to be more like 4 servings, and I would serve bread with it next time."
2041603,35988,2011-10-27,5,Yum! This soup is easy and delicious!
142367,35988,2011-11-22,5,This is quite good and requires little effort.  Think adding some sausage or other meat would help make it a heartier meal.  It reheats well also.  Thank you for sharing!
145352,35988,2012-02-13,4,Good soup. It came together quickly.
8688,35988,2012-02-13,5,"(1/20/2009)This wonderfully flavorful soup can be put together in a matter of minutes.  I made as directed using 6 cups of reduced sodium chicken broth, about 1 cup of chopped onion, 1 (29 0z) can of whole tomatoes and   sausage with cheese fresh tortellini which added a lot of flavor.  This is a great recipe if you have little time to spend preparing supper.  I served with a crispy crust French bread with butter.  Thank you for posting, spatchcock! (Updated 2/13/2012) I continue making this soup.  Now I am using all organic vegetable broth and replacing the tortellini with mini spinach tortellini filled with sun-dried tomato. Super-good!!"
394077,35988,2013-04-07,5,Very delicious soup.  I try to eat less carb so I skipped the tortellini but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My family loves this too. Thank you Spatchcock.
198154,35988,2013-04-29,4,I made this for dinner tonight using cheese tortellini. I also used a bag of fresh spinach.  It was a little smaller than what the recipe called for but it seemed to be perfect.  The fresh grated parm. at the end was a must for us.  It really made the soup.  I had a Italian seasoning grinder on the table that some of us added to the soup as well.  No one in my picky family gave this anything lower than four stars.  Wow! That doesn&#039;t happen often!  I served this with Bada Big Betty&#039;s Tuscan Portabella Melt (193692)  These two wonderful recipes compliment each other well.  Made for a delicious meal!
191533,35988,2014-06-10,4,"Good but not delicious. It is simple as is, but put more in your bowl by simmering carrots, celery, and other veggies first. I also used fresh baby kale instead of spinach."
28649,22782,2002-03-27,4,Tastes very good but next time I make it I will only put in 1 pound of sausage.  My DH is very picky when it comes to spaghetti sauce and he liked this one. Very easy to make also.
8629,22782,2002-04-01,4,This turned out very good. I made half a recipe since there are only 3 of us in the family.  I added some pork neckbones to the sauce while it was simmering. That is supposed to add alot of flavor to a spaghetti sauce.  I was a little unsure of the 2 cups of water so I added about 1 3/4 cups.  Next time I think I will only add 1 cup or possibly leave it out altogether.
29014,22782,2002-04-22,5,"OooooWheeee, Sharlene~W!!  This was soooo tasty!  I added ground beef, too (because DH requested it) but it would be EXCELLENT as is!  It reminds me of the spaghetti sauce the little Italian grandmas made in the old run-down (yet extremely popular) Italian resturants we used to go to at closing time in the 70's.  They always had a 20-quart stockpot simmering 24/7!
I'll be making this often - thanks!!"
38643,22782,2002-05-04,5,Easy to see why everyone loves this recipe. Made it for dinner tonight using Turkey sweet Italian Sausage. It makes alot...that's good cause you'll want more than one serving!
36944,22782,2002-05-23,5,I fixed this spaghetti sauce tonight for dinner and it was great!  The only change I made was omitting the sausage.  I will definitely be making this again & again & again.....
28603,22782,2002-06-03,5,"Very good; I used fresh herbs and refrained from adding peppers, celery, mushrooms...like I normally would if they were in the frig...used leftover sauce for lasagne which is also delicious. UPDATE: Made this again over the weekend; screwed it up and realized I was using the full amount of herbs even though I had started out making half the recipe...duh...but no problem, added another can of tomato sauce; can't wait to finish off the leftovers with some hot garlic bread!"
27643,22782,2002-08-30,5,"I made this because I needed to feed 8 people. This sauce is out of this world!! All present voted it the BEST. I made this exactly like the recipe says. I added all the water and let it simmer for 5 hours and the aroma while it was cooking was wonderful! Sharlene, I can see why this is famous. It truly is delicious! Thanks!"
47559,22782,2002-10-30,5,"Mmm,Mmm,Good! The whole family raved about this last night.  I halved the recipe because we only had four people, but they did not leave any left overs for my lunch! BOO HOO!  I made it with Italian turkey sausage to reduce fat a little, and increased the speed with the low pressure cooker because it was a week night meal (including prep time it was ready in 45 minutes).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I recommend it to any spaghetti lover. We'll sure make it again."
26512,22782,2002-11-08,5,"This is one of the best spaghetti sauces I have ever made. My family thinks mine is the best, as families are prone to do, but they were very pleased with this recipe and it got five stars all around the table.
I did add just a tad bit more red pepper and wine, and we used half ground round and half italian sausage. I also added about 1/4 cup chopped green onion and a freshly chopped ripe tomato.
I served with garlic/mozzarella bread, a fresh salad and a bottle of Jacob's Creek Merlot. Truly delicious, well deserving of the praise it has received. Thanks for a outstanding recipe!"
32772,22782,2002-12-03,5,"This recipe has so much flavor. I used a pound of sausage and ground beef.  I browned the sausage, ground beef,onion and garlic in an electric skillet.  I then placed the meat in my slow cooker along with the other ingredients and mixed well. Cooked it for six hours and it turned out great. Served with angle hair pasta, side salad, and Garlic Texas Toast."
37036,22782,2003-08-06,4,"This sauce is very similar to mine.  I thought this sauce had a very good flavor, but I felt it was missing something.  Perhaps oregano and a by leaf?  Also, I like to add fresh Parmesan cheese to the sauce while cooking.  "
37305,22782,2002-12-23,5,"Well, this is not my mama's spaghetti sauce, that's for sure.  I have used my mom's recipe for 20 years now and have to keep this a secret...but everyone went gaga over Jo Mama's!  It was so great, my daughter was drinking it out of her bowl after she dipped her Italian bread in it!  The only change I made was using crushed tomatoes instead of diced and I simmered for about 3 hours.  All I can say is WOW...Thanks so much for sharing!"
40961,22782,2003-01-04,0,This sauce was delicious. I followed the recipe and let it simmer for 3 hours. My family loved it. Thanks for posting it!
64583,22782,2003-02-11,5,I've made several batches of this sauce and we really love it.  But today I actually used it as a base for chili and it was awesome!  I just added beans and chili spices and some more wine - YUMM!
68460,22782,2003-02-26,5,"Well, what can I say??  This recipe was so darn good!  I made the sauce with 1 1/2 lbs. of Italian sausage and 1 1/2 C. of water.  I did all the rest of the recipe as written.  I used most of the sauce for a spaghetti dinner and then used about 2 cups the following night for a meatball sandwich dinner (I just used store bought frozen meatballs, heated, for the sandwiches).  My family loved both dinners.  Thanks for a great recipe Sharlene!"
52125,22782,2003-03-27,4,Excellent Sauce Thanks!
74281,22782,2003-03-29,5,"My main comment about this recipe is.... WOW!!! I made this for dinner, originally for my DH and I only. We ended up with six people, who all agreed that this is THE BEST spaghetti sauce they have ever tasted. We delayed dinner because friends showed up, so our sauce simmered for about 3 hours. I almost always modify recipies I use to ""make it my own"", but since I had never made homemade sauce before, I followed this one to the letter, and it is delicious! I will make it again and again!"
8688,22782,2003-05-08,5,"Sharlene, I remember adding this recipe to my cookbook the day it was published, yet I have only now gotten around to preparing it.  I now can only ask myself, why did it take me so long?  Your years of perfecting this recipe has paid off as this is a superior spaghetti sauce! I had to prepare this while my husband was out of town because he has always told me never to make any spaghetti sauce other than my own.  Once he tastes your recipe, he may change his mind!  I followed your directions to the letter, using 2 pounds of sweet Italian sausage, removing the casings and stirring to crumble. I used Kendall-Jackson Merlot which proved to be a perfect choice for red wine, and my husband's favorite ;). I served over spaghetti with freshly grated parmesan and freshly sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter and a warmed baguette."
54678,22782,2003-05-29,4,Great Sauce - a belated ranking from Sept/02.
59780,22782,2003-07-31,5,"This was a real winner for my meat loving Husband! I wanted to make a special treat for him, and I thought this would be perfect-and I was right! I did used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and I added a tad more sugar than the recipe called for. I served this with a Caesar Salad and Easy Cheesy Cheddar Bread recipe#56770. My Husband was crazy about the all the meat in this sauce but for myself I would love to try this recipe again and use less meat and more veggies like green pepper, mushrooms, etc, either way, this is a great sauce! Thanks for making my Husband's day!"
91392,22782,2003-08-14,5,"Made this last night, cooked two hours and used almost all of the water, it came out very thick, I may thin it out again a little.  I had to make the change of halving the meat, and using ground fresh pork, mixed with Penzey's Italian sausage spice, which is great when you live in a place without Italian sausage. I also substituted herbes de Provence for the basil, which I was surprised to have run out of.  Some of this will go to work today, for a collegue, some will get frozen, most will get eaten soon.  Very good, very thick, really very inexpensive to make, and easy, once you get all of the cans open.  It didn't even require frequent stirring, din't stick or burn.  I will definitely do it again!"
74652,22782,2003-08-24,5,I made this again and used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage and it came out even better than the first time!  We absolutely love this sauce and it makes alot so I am able to freeze some and make lasagna later!  This is my tried and true spaghetti sauce now!
52543,22782,2003-09-25,3,"Revision to previous comments: In addition to being lower in fat content & colesterol, I prefer the taste of lean ground beef over Italian sausages. Most other reviewers have made that decision also - as well as substantial other modifications to the original recipe!"
44383,22782,2003-10-01,5,"This sauce got rave reviews all around at our house. I was a bit concerned about the heat, I could only get hot italian sausage but it turned out perfect.  Only thing I did differently was make it in the dutch oven the night before, let it sit all night with no heat and then dump it all into the crockpot before leaving for work the next day.  Slow cooked all day, all I had to do was make pasta when I got home.  It was so good, one of the best pasta sauces I've ever had. There's only two of us so I was able to get a minimum of 5 meals from this recipe. Just divided it up into freezer bags.  Thanks!  I love it!"
7108,22782,2004-01-21,4,"This is very similiar to my own spaghetti sauce but I decided to give this one a try.  I used 3/4 lb hot sausage and 3/4lb meatballs.  One can of the diced tomatoes was garlic and onion flavored.  I'm not one for a sweet red sauce and added the brown sugar in to taste, using the entire 1 1/2 tsp anyway and it was fine.  The red wine was a nice additive too."
95743,22782,2004-02-05,5,Wonderful!  A great sauce that makes enough to put some in the freezer for use later. Surprisingly easy and tasted great with only one hour's simmering. Loved it!!
136997,22782,2004-04-10,5,Just add me to the list of growing praises for this very tasty recipe. The fact that it goes a long way is also a plus. Didn't change a thing.
93006,22782,2004-05-26,4,"Very good sauce....I did use the half sausage/half HB combo, and only used 1.5 oz. can diced tomatoes plus an additional can of tomato sauce, as we're not into chunky."
180090,22782,2005-01-23,5,Love! I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef and drained 1/2 the fat out and it turned out delish! I froze the leftover sauce to use later for the lasagna. Thanks for a great comforting meal!
158086,22782,2005-02-10,5,"Okay, add me to the list that loved this recipe...i had an old spaghetti sauce recipe that i always made, but thought i would try a different one...this is wonderful....thick and rich...will be making lasagna with the leftovers tonite...yummm"
56087,22782,2005-07-09,5,"I've been making this for a couple years now and cannot believe I have not reviewed it.  I can almost remembered what I said, oh well.
This is by far the BEST spaghetti sauce ever.  I do not add the wine as the rest would go to waste, and I do add chopped veggies, like green pepper, mushrooms and zuchinni.  I like to keep this made up and in the freezer for ""those nights"".  I always get rave reviews when I make this for company.  Thanks for sharing and sorry it took me 2 years to review it."
53932,22782,2005-11-05,5,I was skeptical because I really like my own sauce and not many others.  This was very good.  I used 1 pound of sausage and only 24 oz of tomato sauce.  I didn't add as much water as called for--perhaps 1/4 cup.  The resulting sauce was nice and thick.  I would add less red pepper next time as it was a bit too spicy (I used a bit less than 1/4 tsp).  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
185285,22782,2005-11-14,5,My husband and I made ourselves sick on this sauce because we ate so much! Undoubtedly the best spaghetti sauce either of us has had at home our out. the only adaptation I made was to slow cook my meatballs in the sauce for about 4 hours in place of the meat throughout.  The 2nd batch I made for DH's football friends I had a chance to use San Marzano tomatoes and the result was spectacular!  This is the kind of recipe you keep for you kids!
222433,22782,2006-01-04,5,"Man...that is some good sauce! Kids wanted to give it 10 stars! I only used 1/2lb of a good Italian sausage and I thought it was plenty meaty. I also used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes and switched 1 can of tom sauce for a can of diced. Worked very well. I used the full 2 cups of water. My Sauce was really thick. I served it
Honeybees Cheesy Garlic Bread. Thanks Sharlene!"
280271,22782,2006-01-15,5,With 237 high reviews why bother with another? Because it is that good! DH said it's the best he has ever tried. He rates everything I  cook. This was a 10. I have to agree with him. Today I'm making the lasagna for tomorrow's dinner. A must make. Enjoy!
47907,22782,2006-01-16,5,Thanks so much for such a great recipe!  I used 1 pound of mild Italian sausage and about 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and a very full-bodied wine.  It came out EXCELLENT!!!!
176615,22782,2006-02-07,5,"Delicious! Everyone in the family enjoyed this sauce. I simmered for several hours and added a touch more water toward the end. Froze part of the batch which will be much appreciated on a busy night. Don't know what I can add to so many reviews except that I made this as stated and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks, Sharlene, for a fabulous dinner!"
278113,22782,2006-03-07,5,"This recipe is certainly a keeper! My 9 year old DD said it was the best sauce we ever had! We made meatballs instead of the sausage, and it was a fantastic meal!"
294000,22782,2006-04-11,5,After 266 great reviews you may not need another one but I still have to add my five stars.  I don't even like spaghetti...at least not until now!  I made this for my DH and it will now be a favorite family recipe.  Thanks!
55578,22782,2006-04-14,5,"This is better than mine, which I thought was the best!  Thanks for the recipe."
222970,22782,2006-04-22,5,"Wow. I probably won't make this too frequently since we all ate way too much! It was that good. We ate till we couldn't eat anymore, and there's still a lot of sauce left for a large dish of lasagna tomorrow.  I used 1 lb sweet Italian sausage which was plenty. After cooking the meat and onions I put everything in the slow cooker and cooked on high for four hours. One cup of water was slightly too much for the slow cooker. I substituted beef broth for the wine.
Thanks Sharlene and the recipe*zaar community!"
124249,22782,2006-05-21,5,"Don't know what I could add that hasn't already been said,. we really liked this sauce.   ma goin got use the leftovers to try your lasagna recipe.

Thanks Sharlene-W.

Bullwinkle."
298447,22782,2006-05-22,5,"This pasta sauce is terrific!  Like other reviewers, I use 1 lb. Italian sauce (hot/spicy) and 1 lb. ground chuck.  Since making the first batch, I have sworn off jarred sauces altogether.  I have found the sauce to taste even better when I make it a day ahead and let the flavors marry overnight.  Simply delicious...thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!"
218535,22782,2006-06-28,1,"I agree with Berna that this recipe is not good for the number of good reviews it got. Infact, my family didn't like it at all. Store bought sauce is so much better. "
59473,22782,2006-07-14,5,This sauce was excellent. After reading most of the reviews I decided to make this with half ground beef and half Italian sausage. I also added some mushrooms to it at the end which I sauteed before hand. Thanks for a great recipe
188119,22782,2006-09-08,4,"I made this for a party and thought it was ok, but I left out the meat so some vegetarians could eat it also.  Our red wine wasn't too great, so that might have been something that could have made the sauce better.  "
125640,22782,2006-12-04,4,"This makes a lot. I halved the recipe to serve 4 adults and we still had almost half of it leftover. I added a small jar of sliced mushrooms, but otherwise made as directed (using the mild sausage). Easy and very good, though I'm not sure it lives up to all the hype. Nobody even commented, much less raved, and I don't see anyone in my family requesting it for special ocassions, but it was a nice everyday meal and I'll make it again. Thanks for sharing."
347822,22782,2006-12-11,4,"Good sauce!!! It was a tad salty but when served over stuffed shells and/or sphaghetti it was good. I used fresh basil and parsley, added a nice 'g'ma kitchen' smell. Thank you for the posting :)"
394077,22782,2006-12-20,4,Very good sauce.  I simmered for 2 hours and the sauce tasted even better the next day.  The changes I made was to increased the sugar to 2 Tablespoons and  only added 1/2 cup of water since I like my sauce thick.  I followed the rest of the recipes exactly. Thank you for sharing it.
142559,22782,2007-01-05,5,"This is truly outstanding spaghetti! I never thought I would be wild about spaghetti, but this is phenomenal! The spices are fantastic and meld together perfectly. This is my favorite spaghetti sauce - bar none! I omitted the Italian sausage, only because I didn't have any on hand (and no time to run to the store - had a hungry hubby!). In a pinch, I have made this before with jar sauce (adding all of the other ingredients) and it was still incredible.  Thank you Sharlene!!"
58836,22782,2007-01-13,5,"ok here you go.  Made this and took to a bunch of hungry men, women and youth who were working on a building for our youth of the community.  I did like some of the other and used half mild sausage and half ground beef.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written except didn't add the red pepper.  I might next time.  Thought it tasted really good.  Thanks!"
359220,22782,2007-02-14,5,"I'm giving this recipe 5 stars, even though I made 2 changes.  I omitted the red wine ( I was out, it was cold; but I'll try it next time) and subbed the Pasta Sprinkle herb mix from Penzeys for the basil and parsley.  I only simmered mine for 30 minutes, but it was great.  All the flavors melded perfectly, not one over the others.  Consistency was nice and thick.  Will definitely use again."
386849,22782,2007-10-04,5,"Wow, this sauce is amazing! I followed the other suggestions and added only 1 lb. of sausage and 1 lb. ground beef, and added only 1/2 c. water because I'm going to serve it right away. It does make a lot, but that's great because I'm going to freeze it for another meal. Thanks, Sharlene!
Addition: After I reviewed this I added 1 tsp. baking soda as previously suggested to reduce acid in the tomatoes to prevent heartburn.  What a terrible mistake!  I'm not trying to be mean but it completely ruined the sauce and made it have a very wierd antacid taste, which botched my whole pot of sauce. Just wanted to give a warning to those that read that review and think it's a great idea (like I did).  Trust me, it's not!"
579298,22782,2007-10-06,5,"I followed the instructions to a T and the sauce was perfect! DH went back for FOURTHS - and I couldn't believe the difference adding a little red wine would make! I wanted to add the whole bottle! The recipe made enough for another evening, which is great because all I have to do is go to my freezer and I'll have gourmet quality spaghetti instead of Prego. No need to FEAR 'Jo Mama's World Famous Spaghetti' is HERE!! Woo HOO!"
312577,22782,2007-10-12,5,"I made this last night, however I used Kittencal's meatballs.  My BF said he could eat this forever.  Great sauce.  I am thankful that you took the time to perfect this recipe.  I absolutely think that this a 5 star recipe!"
140132,22782,2007-11-05,4,This was good.  My DD loves spaghetti and was asking for it.  I found your recipe and thought it must be good.  We weren't dissappointed.  The red wine takes this over the top....delicious.  Thank you for this great recipe....STephanie
60260,22782,2007-12-28,5,"Had to try this recipe after reading all the reviews! I made it yesterday and invited the neighbors - all six of us gave it a thumbs up. I made it with 1/2 hamburger, 1/2 mild italian sausage, added more garlice (6 cloves) and used lots of fresh basil. I left the water as is and simmered it for a little more than 4 hours. I think it's going to become one of ""our"" recipes from now on. Thanks for sharing!"
377581,22782,2008-02-19,4,This sauce was tasty. The red wine and sugar gave it a great flavor! I used half mild italian sausage and half ground beef and I added green peppers and celery with the onions. A keeper! Thank you!!
632249,22782,2008-03-22,3,"I changed the recipe by using 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground beef because we aren`t sausage fans.  I felt it needed more spices when it was done, so threw in more garlic and basil.  I like a thicker sauce, so would reduce the water next time, and maybe add in some mushrooms and green pepper. Thx."
132383,22782,2008-04-06,5,Not much else to add to all the wonderful reviews....made as directed and totally devoured it.  YUMMY.
316717,22782,2008-05-07,5,Delicious! followed everything to the T. it was a hit w/ everyone. can't wait to try the lasagna next. will put this in my favorites. thank you for sharing!
497077,22782,2008-06-01,5,"DELICIOUS! I have made several times now-exactly as written except last time I did use my crock pot. I just browned my meat w/ onions and then placed everything in my crock pot and cooked on high for 3 hours. Oh, and I like to add mushrooms. Thank you so much for a great recipe!!!"
305531,22782,2008-09-02,5,Great spaghetti sauce! I followed the recipe as written and used hot Italian sausage. The wine really added a nice depth to the sauce. Thanks Sharlene for a keeper. Made for I Recommend tag.
182624,22782,2008-09-12,4,"We loved this sauce.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, although next time I'll definitely add mushrooms and perhaps some ground beef.  It makes a lot; there was plenty left to freeze for another meal or two."
485151,22782,2008-09-14,5,This was awesome spaghetti! I used half sausage & half turkey burger and it was very meaty. It was so good that my friend who doesn't like spaghetti sauce on her spaghettil ate it! I half half the recipe in the freezer for an easy dinner another time.
318235,22782,2008-10-02,4,"I made this for my weekly ""Pasta Wednesday"" dinner party last night and thought that it was pretty good. I added only 1lb of sausage because I don't like it too meaty and reduced the water to one cup. After an hour of simmering the taste wasn't quite there for me so added about another teaspoon of brown sugar and another 1/4 teaspoon of fresh pepper. I allowed it to simmer for another half hour before serving. In the end I will say it wasn't world famous in my opinion but it was very good and my guests liked it. My biggest complaint is that I think the tomato paste taste was a little too strong and I may only add 1 can next time. Thank you very much for giving me something new to try!"
847160,22782,2008-10-06,5,wow ...did this with meatballs insted ...it was one one the best spaghetti ever thanks
439797,22782,2009-01-29,5,My family adored this recipe.  This will become a regular in my house.  Thanks for a great recipe!
333017,22782,2009-03-05,5,"What can I say that hasn't been said before (many times!!!!)  But,
I did change it a bit to use up some leftover ""its and bits"" from the freezer and added some sun dried tomatoes that I had dehydrated.  I followed some other suggestions, and used half ground beef and half mild Italian sausage.  I slow cooked the sauce on the stove for for about 5 hours and I found that I needed to add some tomato juice to cut the saltiness (I guess from the Italian sausage).  I also used the suggestion of adding 1 tsp of baking soda to take out some of the acid.  The sauce turned out thick and wonderful.  When I have time to ""putter"" around in the kitchen, I will definately make this sauce again!"
242484,22782,2009-06-15,5,My family all thought this was awesome! Definitely my new turn-to recipe for spaghetti sauce!  I made Simple Red Wine Coolers #31066 with the rest of the bottle of red wine.
937635,22782,2009-07-06,5,"Excellent Spaghetti Sauce! The wine gives the sauce its depth - so it's true about using a good wine. I had a mediocre cab on hand that ran a little sweet, so next time I'm definitely heading for a drier more complex wine. I'm going to try the baking soda trick, too. I wanted to try the recipe as stated first and then try the baking soda since it sounds interesting and personally I can get overwhelmed by tomato sauces. This was a fantastic tomato sauce though - don't get me wrong! My SO loved it!! I made it with Kittencal's Garlic Parmesan Bread and green beans. Yummmm!"
879716,22782,2009-08-06,5,WOW - I know I should probably wait until I've actually eaten this stuff to rate it but I'm just too excited by it.  I used 1 lb of Recipe #31008 (half beef and half turkey sans celery) and a couple Recipe #100408 I had left over and put everything in the crockpot (without the addition of water) last night.  I woke up at 4am to the most wonderful aroma and had a hard time going back to sleep.  I used the baking soda trick (posted by Jan Marie) after tasting it and it mellowed the acidity perfectly.  I did add a few bay leaves to the pot before refridgerating the whole pot this morning just for personal preference.  I am soooo looking forward to dinner tonight!  I already know I'll never buy pre-made sauce again - especially since using the crockpot made this so darn convenient.  And the wonderful part is that there will be plenty sauce for leftovers and some to freeze since my crockpot is nearly full and there are only two of us at my house.  This is a special sauce and I look forward to making it for my next dinner party!  Thank you many times over  :)
203325,22782,2009-08-29,5,This is by far my favorite spaghetti recipe.  Much better than jar sauce.  I have made it many times.
529278,22782,2009-09-27,4,"Tasty, thank you!"
145352,22782,2009-10-07,4,This was pretty good. Not sweet enuff for my family's taste tho. Made for OAMC.
55729,22782,2009-12-03,4,"This was really good. I discovered I was out of basil. Then I realized that the recipe as written had no oregano, so I subbed that. Used 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper, which was perfect for us. I did use the onion. I guess I didn't realize this made so much - I started to say I would halve it next time. However, I think I will stick the other 2 qt. in the freezer, and if it is good, I will always make the full batch. Two dinners for one set of effort! Everyone ate it all, and the picky husband didn't have any ""helpful suggestions"" which makes me happy."
928301,22782,2010-01-29,2,"tons of time and ingredients, brought little appreciation for my husband.  I didn't taste anything significant, and he felt that it needed a lot more flavor."
173314,22782,2010-02-13,5,other than reducing sausage to 12 oz. all else I kept the same figuring i may also use meatballs with it.  It was so good. Thank you very much. had with stuffed shells.
262312,22782,2010-03-02,5,"great recipe!!  i actually threw this in the crockpot after sautÃ©ing the meat, onions and garlic.  i cooked this up a day ahead of time and then just reheated in crock pot for dd's spaghetti birthday dinner!  the only changes i made were to use half ground beef and half sausage, use italian seasoning instead of just basil, omitted the sugar, added more wine and went less on the water (since i was crock potting).  served with kittencal's parmesan meatballs, pesto sauce, angel hair pasta, rotini and bow ties, parmesan garlic bread, greek salad and sangria!  thanks so much for sharing!  judging by all the other great reviews, this is clearly the most popular spaghetti sauce recipe on this site, congrats on that sharlene...that's a pretty big honor!!!  ;)"
195589,22782,2010-04-20,5,"This was really good! Like others, I used half hamburger, half sausage. I also cut the water to 1 cup as I didn't have the time to simmer as long as I would have liked. I doubled the onion and added 2 Tablespoons of Italian seasoning as well. Thanks for posting Sharlene."
1133190,22782,2010-06-10,5,"Wonderful sauce! I substituted hamburger for the sausage because it's what I had on hand.  I will try this in the crock pot next time as suggested by others so I don't have to constantly be watching it.  Oh, and I did about double the brown sugar called for as we like a slightly sweeter sauce. Thanks for the recipe."
198154,22782,2010-10-24,4,"This is a nice sauce.  Not too thick, not to thin"
76951,22782,2011-01-03,5,Excellent!  What can I say that hasn't been said already?  A definite keeper!
362983,22782,2011-02-11,5,"Great recipe! I made a few slight changes: used lean ground beef, added some oregano, chili powder and some bay leaves, and upped the spice since we love our spicy food. I did leave out the red wine and it was still great without. Cooked it low and slow for about 2 hours and it came together nicely. Thanks!"
232480,22782,2011-02-14,3,"This was ok.  For nearly 1,000 reviews I was expecting something phenomenal, but I didn't find that here.  I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of eliminating all the water and simmering all day in my crockpot to allow flavors to meld.  Certainly good, but so far I've not found anything that, in my opinion, tops my own recipe."
400708,22782,2011-07-05,5,"With 940 reviews and 40 photos you really don't need any more but this was so good I have to put in my comments.  I made this as directed except for a few minor change, I used a mixture of both sausage and hamburger meat and instead of cooking on the stove top I browned the meat, onions and garlic then dumped it all in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours.  The end result was soooo good, truly ""world famous"" and this is how I'll be doing spaghetti from now on.  The flavors are awesome and just the right amount of kick with the red pepper flakes.  The one problem I had is I didn't see wine listed in the ingrediants so wasn't sure how much to add so I just added 3/4 cup and it came out great.  With the left over sauce, I froze and will be eager to use again when DH gets hungry.  Served with recipe#404470 and the last of the Washington red wine I added to the spaghetti - what a great dinner."
456858,22782,2011-09-11,4,"This was pretty darn good!  Ya, see, my Dad is an excellent chef (born and raised in Italy) and he makes excellent homemade sauce.  He has given me the recipe, but I CANNOT duplicate the taste. After much frustration, I decided to give this a try.  My husband was impressed, and that doesn't happen too often.  I did use turkey sausage to cut down on the fat.  This sauce was a little thicker than what I like (I just prefer a lighter sauce), but again, flavor was good.  Might make again, either using less tomato paste or more water."
222055,22782,2012-02-18,5,"Rated this 5 stars in 2006 with a good review but not a review of justice. I have returned to this recipe many times and double it to freeze. Freezes wonderfully! Today  I will be sharing the recipe with my daughter-n-law. Why should I take all the glory! lol My youngest son had some spaghetti the other day from somewhere else and said ""how can I eat this when I have had the best, yours!"" and he stopped eating. Thank you so much for making me look good! Love it and love you for sharing! <3"
251626,22782,2012-07-06,5,Loved it. Could not be any better.
132764,22782,2012-10-14,5,"Holy... yum!! I've never bothered using a sauce recipe before... I've always just winged it. But this recipe is worth paying attention to! I made meatballs, so I skipped the sausage portion of the program, and doubled everything except the crushed peppers and it was simply amazing. This will be my go to sauce recipe from now one."
2549237,22782,2013-02-19,4,"This is a great little recipe.  Word to the wise, unless you like very spicy food DO NOT use 2 lbs of hot sausage.   We did this and it is really spicy.  We still liked it, but next time I will definitely sub in Sweet Italian Sausage.  Thanks for a great recipe Sharlene!"
383346,22782,2013-07-10,5,This spaghetti sauce is so good.  I used spicy italian sausages and merlot red wine.  Thanks Sharlene :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game
226863,22782,2013-07-12,5,"Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 italian sausage and 1/2 ground chuck.  Drained the fat off before adding the onions.  I kept reading over the recipe looking for the oregano...LOL.  I made it exactly as posted and we really enjoyed it.  Didn&#039;t miss the oregano at all.  I did add a splash more wine.  I simmered for 4 hours....its even better the next day.  Thanks for sharing!"
653438,22782,2013-07-28,5,Another great review!!!  I made half of this recipe using ground beef and Italian turkey sausage less water and followed the rest of the ingredients.  DH was in heaven!  We had enough left over for another meal.  Definately a keeper.  I did cook the sauce on low also for 4 1/2 to 5 hours served over spaghetti and served with a green salad (with Italian dressing) and garlic bread.  Thank you for posting the recipe.
37779,22782,2014-03-17,5,"Made this for dinner last night. This is a super great sauce. Only change I made was to use 1 lb. ground beef /1 lb Italian sausage (personal preference). Well seasoned and just the right balance of sauciness to meatiness. Also, quite easy to make. Thanks for sharing your World Famous recipe. Wish I hadn&#039;t waited so long to try it."
103876,22782,2014-03-26,5,Wow! I can&#039;t believe it had taken me so long to try this recipe.  I have made many homemade sauce recipes but there is just something special about this one. I think it is the wine.  I used chicken italian sausage cut into chunks and only made 1/2 a recipe since there are only 3 of us.  I am wishing now that I would have made the whole amount because it is so good.  I found that the amount of water was fine as it needed to be thinned quite a bit.  I simmered for about an hour and then let it sit on the stove for a few hours before serving. The extended time improved the flavor quite a bit. I&#039;m looking forward to making this again soon! Thanks for posting.
1581225,22782,2016-11-07,3,"I tried this instead of my usual go-to spaghetti sauce one night. I didn't enjoy it, although my kids did, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. I just can't get around using the sausage instead of ground beef. My go-to sauce is this one http://www.food.com/recipe/authentic-bolognese-sauce-sugo-alla-bolognese-474008"
315055,22782,2017-04-25,5,"This was great, the italian seasoned meat added a lot. I saved the rest to make the lasagna on a different day...my hubby thought it tasted like it was from Buca Di Beppo's!"
88099,22782,2018-08-24,3,This was just okay for us. I thought it needed more seasoning. As other reviewers recommended I used one pound of Italian Sausage and one pound of hamburger meat. Than ks for sharing.
64203,53914,2003-08-21,5,"I LOVE this recipe! Tastes great and it is so easy! Seems like a gourmet dish without all the work.
Highly recommend!"
92886,53914,2003-10-23,4,"This made a nice moist, tender and flavorful fish.  I would use it again and I don't think I would change anything. "
91392,53914,2004-02-13,5,"Very very good.  Cooked fast with thin fish, will become a permanent fish dish for us!"
74652,53914,2004-02-24,5,Fabulous!  I used flounder since it was on sale and it was fantastic! DH does not like fish very much but he said he likes this very much! I broiled it.  The topping was nice and golden brown and the fish was nice and flaky and light!   Thanks for a great recipe! :)
93006,53914,2004-02-28,5,Outstanding flavor.  I used mahi-mahi and the delicious topping made for a company-worthy meal!
37636,53914,2004-03-02,4,"This recipe cooks fine, but I felt it lacked a little in flavor and was almost ""bland"", unlike many of the things other reviews have chosen to describe it as. I tried adding some more lemon to the top of the cooked fish but that didn't seem to help much. I am wondering if it needs something...perhaps a little garlic? This is not something I would serve to guests or on a special occasion, as other reviewers have said. It just seems a bit ordinary to me for that. But for a weeknight meal, I might tinker with this and try it again. Thanks!"
8688,53914,2004-03-25,5,"This dish was excellent!  Very easy to prepare and the taste was superb!  I loved the topping which gave the fish such a wonderful flavor, yet did not overpower the fish.  I offered extra lemon slices at the table and also served with a broccoli casserole and homemade bread.  This recipe will go into my permanent cookbook file!  Thank you so much, Crabbycakes, for sharing this with us!"
76951,53914,2004-04-01,5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  Absolutely a keeper!  The flavor was out of this world and, on top of it, so easy.  We will be having this over and over again!"
35526,53914,2004-04-13,5,"This was a really good low carb entree.  Loved the flavors and the ease that the recipe came together.  I kind of got mess up with the instructions, my fault.  I should have read ahead.  I could have put the fish in the oven while I was making the topping...ooops."
29014,53914,2004-04-28,5,Excellent and easy weeknight recipe!  I made the recipe exactly as posted except to cut it in half for just the two of us.  We ate every last bite!  Thank you for posting this Wisconsin classic!
42720,53914,2004-05-02,5,"Bravo, Crabbycakes!!
We thorougly enjoyed this recipe and will be making it again.  Wonderful taste and so easy to prepare."
88099,53914,2004-07-04,5,"Crabbycakes, you probably don't need another 5 star, but I had to put my 2 cents worth in.  This was absolutely wonderful.  I followed the directions to the letter, but did broil the fish the last few minutes to brown the cheese sause at the end.  I have had trouble with my appitite lately and this is the first thing that has actually tasted good to me in a couple of months.  I actually ate 3 whole pieces of the fish.  Thanks for a great recipe."
37449,53914,2004-08-04,5,I picked this for the I Recommend this Recipe game and I'm so glad I did! This was delicious! I halved the recipe with no problem. I broiled the fish too and the topping came out nice and browned. Thanks Crabbycakes!
49304,53914,2004-08-08,5,"Delicious, We love Tilapia, this recipe is another GREAT way to fix it. the fish was thin so it didn't take long to bake. Love the combnation of the flavors in the sauce,(used old bay seasoning). I put it under the broiler after adding the cheese mixture. Thank you Crabbycakes, for posting a delicious recipe."
51011,53914,2004-09-17,5,"Recipes do not get better than this!!! I have made it twice now, the first time my dh loved it so much he just about fell over.  The second time he had a friend over who loved it as well.  Even better the next day for lunch! No changes had to be made at all.  You really dont notice the mayo at all (this coming from someone who hates it!) Thanks so much for sharing! This will become a regular meal in our house. :)"
7108,53914,2004-10-26,5,"Delicious and easy...I can't believe I missed this one!  I didn't have any green onions so I used white onion instead; I also broiled the fish for a total of 8 minutes and it came out perfect.  This is great for my low carb diet.  I'll be making this one over and over, thanks!"
47559,53914,2004-12-30,4,"We enjoyed this recipe.  I used Cajun seasoning instead of seasoned salt, and broiled it the last few minutes to get a nice golden brown color.  Thanks for sharing."
32058,53914,2005-01-08,5,We had this alongside a seafood assortment and it had such a delicious flavor.  Melted in our mouths!  Sprinkled top with parsley for a little color.  Next time will add capers to top it.  I used frozen tilapia and it was perfect!  Will definately make again and again!
173579,53914,2005-01-26,5,This recipe is great!  It has so much flavor.  Very simple and easy to make.  Couldn't go to a restaurant and get any better!  I will be making this from now on.  Thanks for posting.
64934,53914,2005-02-09,5,"Absolutely wonderful!  How can a dish this easy to prepare turn out so delicious! The only change I made was to use sole fillets since I didn't have tilapia!  I also used the broiler method to cook this, and the fish was nice and moist inside, and the top was a nice golden brown.   We'll definitely be having this often!  Thanks Crabbycakes... and Mama's Supper Club, too!!    "
124249,53914,2005-04-15,4,"I liked this dish but my husband only liked the topping. It was easy to prepare but I had to cook my fish more than 5 minutes,.

Thanks Crabbycakes

Bullwinkle."
53932,53914,2005-09-16,5,"What can I add that hasn't been written?  This was really, really good.  I halved the butter and doubled the Old Bay Seasoning.  I only baked my thin fillets for about half the time suggested and they were perfectly done.  Garlic would be a nice addition and I will try that next time.  Thank you for sharing the recipe."
185285,53914,2006-01-12,5,This was great. I put it over spaghetti squash with extra sauce and used FF mayo.  Delish!
176615,53914,2006-03-22,5,"Fantastic! Used reduced-fat Hellman's mayo which worked well. Otherwise, made as directed, modifying the cooking time a bit since my filets were thin. A nice change from the blackened fish I usually eat. Will definitely make again! Thnaks, Crabbycakes, for sharing the recipe!"
37779,53914,2006-07-08,5,Baked fish is sometimes a hard sell at my house. My kids and husband absolutely loved this tilapia--me too. The buttery cheese topping was luscious. I use light butter and light mayonnaise with no ill effects. Thanks for providing this recipe; will make this one again.
230557,53914,2006-10-04,5,"I loved this!  Yes, just me - the rest of the family won't touch fish, lucky me.  Good, creamy flavor and it looks great if put under the broiler for a couple minutes.  I used Old Bay, added Garlic and a little more Basil - Also subbed sour cream for the mayo as I don't like cooked mayo.  Thanks for a ral winner of a recipe.  "
269331,53914,2006-10-28,3,"Sorry, this was just not up my ally.  Iâ€™ve had Tilapia many times before, but I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ canâ€™t put my finger on itâ€¦ may be too much for a delicate fish or the Old Bay?"
280271,53914,2006-11-06,5,"DH took one bite and said ""this is really good""!! It all went together with ease and the flavor was just out of this world. The whole dish melted in your mouth. I will be preparing this dish quite often. Thanks, Crabbycakes for posting this delicious dish."
26512,53914,2006-11-30,4,"Very, very good dish. I'd give this a 4.5 - I used Old Bay and added a bit of salt. I baked at 350 and then broiled. The only issue I had, the butter started smoking under the broiler, I didn't get the topping as brown as I would have liked. I'm wondering if some of the butter could be cut down, I'm not sure it would be missed. Will definitely make again, thanks for posting."
140132,53914,2007-02-01,5,"I have made this two times now and we absolutely love this recipe.  Even hubby who isn't a fan of parmesan cheese.  I used orange roughy the first time and tilapia the second, both are delicious. This is a great fish recipe, a nice change from just plain baked fish......Stephanie"
227607,53914,2007-03-10,5,This was wonderful.  Even my husband who says everything is OK said that this was really good.  All the kids liked it except one that does not like fish.  I will definately make it again.
265954,53914,2007-05-22,5,"Bravo for this recipe.  I made tilapia fillets and they were delicious.  The only thing I added was extra lemon juice once the fillets were cooked and ready to serve.  Next time, I will double the sauce so that there will be extra in the pan to drizzle over the pasta.  Thanks, Crabbycakes!"
286851,53914,2007-05-26,4,"This was my first attempt at cooking fish, and it turned out very well. It was very easy to make, and I had most of the topping ingredients already on hand. I also had trouble getting the topping to brown as someone else mentioned. I had to broil it an additional 2 minutes which browned it slightly, but I was also afraid of overcooking it, so I didn't cook it any longer. I also had trouble with the topping sort of sliding off the fish. We just slid it right back on, which didn't alter the flavor. My husband really enjoyed this, and said it was ""restaurant quality"" fish. Even my 4 year old who has never eaten much fish liked it. Despite my ""browning"" problems, we will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing."
520150,53914,2007-06-26,5,"I loved this!  The first time I made it just for me (dh doesn't like fish).  I liked it so much, the next time I made it, I only made 1/2 tilapia.  The other 1/2 I used chicken breasts (cut & pounded so it was the same size & thickness of the tilapia & would cook at the same speed).  We have found a wonderfully delicious common ground.  Now I don't have to cook 2 separate meals whenever I want fish.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe that I will make again & again."
58836,53914,2007-07-11,4,This was pretty good.  I didn't have parmesan cheese and had some romano that I needed to use up so I used it instead but it was too strong I thought.  Next time I will use the parmesan.  Thanks.
278113,53914,2007-07-21,5,This was a hit on our house! even the kids really loved it..we will be making this again for sure! Thanks for sharing this recipe!
59473,53914,2007-08-06,5,"This fish was delicious and so simple to make. I used freshly squeezed lemon juice, and pickeral instead of the tilapia. I will certainly try it with other types of fish. Thanks for a great recipe."
60992,53914,2007-10-01,4,"This was a tasty dish, but I felt the amount of basil overpowered all of the other flavors. Next time I prepare this I will cut the amount in half. Otherwise you cannot beat it for ease of preperation or how wonderful it looks on the plate."
229524,53914,2007-10-23,5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!!  The flavor was out of this world.  Sure glad you posted this FANTASTIC recipe Crabbycakes :)
111291,53914,2007-11-14,5,"As if the 190+ ratings don't say enough, I'm adding one more!! If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!  Thanks for a delicious, delicious recipe.  Easy to make, too.  I used only 1 Tbs. of butter and didn't miss it at all.  Also used some red onion instead of chives.  The flavor was ""off the chart!""  Thanks again, Crabbycakes.  This will be made regularly in our home."
486718,53914,2007-12-03,5,This was excellent! Restaurant quality at home and so easy.  I have been making this at least once a week as it was a big hit with the family. Thanks!
207176,53914,2008-01-01,5,DH loved it!  We all did (except my youngest son who really doesn't eat much fish).  I used flounder and broiled it.  For the season salt I used Lawry's.  This is like recipe#7674 for flounder but I liked the addition of season salt and basil which that recipe doesn't have.  I used low-fat mayo. Thanks for posting!
125640,53914,2008-01-04,1,Easy to make. Unfortunately nobody here liked the taste. Thanks for sharing though.
358796,53914,2008-03-24,4,"Nice tilapia that tastes like something a restaurant would serve. However it was very oily for us with all that butter, mayo and cheese which made it rich. Would make again and add in a bit more old bay and hot sauce and less butter mixture."
394077,53914,2008-04-21,5,"Oh MaMa, this is good.  I reduced the butter to 2 Tablespoons. Broiled it as directed. So fast , so easy and sooooo good.  I ate 4 filets by myself.  It was that good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  No more plain old fried tilapia."
969481,53914,2008-11-14,5,"This is the only fish recipe the DH actually requests, and heâ€™s not much of a fish eater. We use a few more dashes of hot pepper sauce just as a personal (DH) preference. Thanks for a great recipe!"
132383,53914,2008-11-16,5,"This recipe was just outstanding. I am not much of a fish eater but I was just diagnosed with gestational diabetes....so I am trying to incorporate more fish as it is low in carbs. I like breaded, parmesan tilapia but was looking for something without breading.  I'm so glad we found this recipe!!"
579298,53914,2008-11-29,5,"Yep, 200+ reviews say it all! This is grEAT! Nothing needs changin' :) My fillets were a tad on the frozen side, so I cooked them for the longer duration but they still turned out wonderfully. Thanks Crabbycakes for posting such a delicious recipe!"
135887,53914,2009-01-17,4,"One more good review.  Made as directed except I used freshly shredded parm cheese.  Made as directed using Old Bay in place of the seasoning salt.  This was very good and we all enjoyed it.  I can see where some might think the mayo is too strong so if you are sensitive to mayo, cut it back"
43083,53914,2009-03-22,4,YUM! These were tasty. I made them tonight for dinner. I had to sub chives for the green onion but other than that stayed true to the recipe. I would probably use a bit less mayo next time but that is just me. My 7 yr old ate 3 fillets on his own!
316717,53914,2009-04-15,5,very good. i did add some red hot pepper flakes.
632249,53914,2009-04-30,5,We loved it!  I cut the recipe in half since only 2 of us were enjoying this tonight.  I did find it a bit too buttery but I just drained it off at the end.  I replaced the green onions with chives. I would like to try this with sole as I find Tilapia a bit stronger or fishier than I like.  Thx for sharing this wonderful recipe!
377039,53914,2009-09-12,4,"I made this using Hoki fish instead of Tilapia.  The sauce was very tasty, but the fish was very fish-y. I'll try this again with actual Tilapia, and if it's substantially different, will revise my rating.

The sauce was slightly grainy; I'll use cream cheese instead of (or half and half with) Parmesan next time to adapt to my family's tastes.

Thanks for the recipe, Crabbycakes!"
74281,53914,2009-10-09,5,"SOOOO delicious! I thought I had frozen Tilapia at home but it was catfish so I used that. Had to leave out the green onions so used about 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder instead. The fish was beautiful when it came out of the oven and tasted like it looked. I eventually convinced my 7-1/2 year old grandson who said ""I don't like FISH"" to take a bite and as I put it in his mouth he said ""yuk....YUM!!!"" and ate about 1/2 of mine even though he'd already had his dinner. My 3 year old twin granddaughters also loved it! I really could have eaten the topping with a spoon but for sure I will use this recipe over and over!! UPDATE: Made this with Tilapia and it is super good! For the seasoning salt I used a bit of Cajun seasoning."
329638,53914,2009-11-22,4,"We enjoyed this very much, with a side salad and grilled vegetables and rice.  I used only 2T butter, and was still fantastic.  I served it again at a lunch with some friends, and everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting!"
242484,53914,2011-03-09,5,"Oh My, this was the best fish ever!  I could eat the entire pan!  Every one loved it and that is saying a lot since my family is not big fish eaters."
55578,53914,2011-04-18,5,Very good!  I halved the recipe and used sweet onions instead of green (didn't have any). Tx for the recipe!
928301,53914,2011-09-01,5,"Very good.  I halved the recipe for four tilapia.  I had tried this before, but used Miracle Whip (we don't keep mayo in the house) & was pretty disgusted by it.  This time I used Spicy Mayo & thought it was wonderful.  I put a little more seasoning salt than requested & possibly more pepper than expected--I like flavor."
1365025,53914,2011-10-17,3,"I've used mayonnaise on fish and chicken before so I knew I was going to like it and with so many good reviews I thought this was a winner for sure. I broiled it which was fast and easy. The fish was nice and moist but something was just missing, kinda bland. There was a taste I just didn't care for, I think it was the Basil and perhaps shredded Parmesan would have been better than the grated Parmesan."
2041603,53914,2011-10-27,5,This is amazing. Our favorite tilapia recipe!
400708,53914,2012-06-28,5,Lovely light tilapia and easy to fix.  Next time think I'll do it in the broiler to get that toasty brown color without over cooking the fish.  I liked others idea about adding some lemon zest to the top too but still wonderful as I made it.  Enjoyed this wonderful blend of flavors without over powering the tilapia itself.
103876,53914,2012-07-19,5,"I made this tonight for something different and everyone really liked it.  I halved the recipe and used light mayo, less than 1 tblsp. of soft butter and no salt and it still turned out great.  Also added some garlic powder and sprinkled a few seasoned breadcrumbs on top before broiling.  I cooked the (frozen) fish about 15-20 minutes before adding the topping.  It browned up perfectly and looked beautiful.  Thanks for posting!"
55729,53914,2012-03-12,4,"I enjoyed this recipe. I used the IQF fillets, which usually end up really watery even when fully thawed. I also only had one pound, but it was 6 fillets! They were really thin. I should have spaced them out into a larger pan (my mistake). After the first cooking (10 min.), I used a turkey baster to remove some excess liquid. Then I added the topping and baked an additional 5 min. They didn't really brown but they were cooked perfectly (but runny again). I enjoyed the flavor, but my fish-hating son wasn't fooled. Even so, I will probably make this again. I have a few strategies up my sleeve now if I have to use the frozen fillets again, but I would love to try fresh."
126104,53914,2012-06-04,5,"This was excellent.  I used the ""parmesan"" in the green can--too lazy to grate fresh.  I might just sprinkle the salt/Old Bay on the fish directly next time.  I may take the advice of another reviewer and add some lemon zest next time.  Thanks for a lovely recipe."
136997,53914,2012-06-05,5,Scaled the recipe back to serve two. Omitted the hot sauce and added the lemon zest along with the juice. Don't like wasting expensive lemons. Delicious. :)
177933,53914,2013-10-24,5,Just another glowing 5 star review ;) I used Costco frozen tilapia... 5 filets next time I&#039;ll make six because my family gobbled it up. Used just a tbl less of the butter and added fresh garlic! Thank you!
39835,53914,2014-02-01,5,Delicious! I used the tilapia and the rest of the ingredients as listed but subbed oregano for the basil. Served with broiled tomatoes and grapes.
98919,53914,2014-03-05,5,"WOW this is awesome!! I used Old Bay for the seasoning and broiled mine. It came out very moist and the cheesy, buttery topping is To Die For!! Thanks for sharing the recipe MaMa and Crabbycakes!!"
1581225,53914,2015-07-08,4,"I don&#039;t eat a lot of fish, but this was pretty good. I did not use tilapia, as we can&#039;t really get that here (or it may be called something else) but I just used a mild, white fish from the fish shop."
22015,27208,2002-06-10,5,"They don't come much easier than this.  It was the perfect Sunday dinner.  My DH hates roast and until now there was only one recipe for roast that he would eat.  After cooking for him for almost 20 years, I can finally add a second.  Thanks for posting this one."
29014,27208,2002-06-20,5,"Excellent, easy, and worry-free!  Followed the recipe as shown, but used only 1/2 of the Italian salad dressing package, as advised.  I saved the other half package for the next time I make this, because there WILL be a next time!  And I just used a plain ol' pot roast.
Thanks!"
38643,27208,2002-06-23,4,Used a rump roast and half of the ranch dressing and it turned out well.Made sandwiches.
27643,27208,2002-06-26,5,"It's as good as everyone says! I used a boneless chuck roast (3 lb) and cut the ranch dressing in half. I added an additional 1/4 cup water. I cooked it 9 hours. It came out very tender, and with a gravy that was superb! Served with mashed potatoes and steamed fresh garden peas. Thanks, yooper! This is one that I will repeat!!"
28649,27208,2002-07-03,5,I've never had a roast turn out so well in the crockpot.  This was very tasty.  I put potatoes on the bottom and the roast on top.  Very easy dinner.  I will be making this again~~love the combination of the seasonings.
37868,27208,2002-07-07,5,"Great taste...I took others advice and cut back on the mixes. We had a wonderful dinner last night and my daughter took the rest home with her for sandwiches on onion buns...with the gravy and cheese. We tryed one here...It is really good.
This recipe is rally good. Thank You"
47559,27208,2002-10-06,5,"I've been holding off on this one - not sure about the seasoning packets - a bit skeptical, perhaps.  Glad I tried it.  I've never made a pot roast that was so easy to do.  This chuck roast was fall apart tender.  I used 1/2 packet Italian dressing, but a full packet of Ranch, and a full packet of mushroom gravy (was out of beef gravy).  Coated the roast and put the rest of the seasoning into the broth - I used a can of beef broth instead of the water.  Put potatoes and carrots in with it.  Cooked on high for about 4 hours and low the rest of the day.  Not at all salty.  DH and DS didn't leave any left overs!!!"
35526,27208,2002-10-14,5,"I used a bottom round roast.  I bet money that it would be tough.  I lost.  I t was tender and the gravy was great.  I added carrots, onion and mushrooms at the beggining.  Added potatoes the last hour.  My house smelled soooo good.  Good recipe Mark XXOO."
56087,27208,2002-11-09,5,"What is there to say that hasn't already been said... needs to have a 10 star rating... didn't change a thing, loved it the way it was... definate keeper... thanks"
49304,27208,2002-11-11,5,"Great pot roast, used a small chuck roast,so I only used 1/2 package of the Italian dressing and 1/2 package of the ranch used all of the gravy mix. It turned out just right."
37449,27208,2002-11-11,5,"I used a bone-in chuck roast, cut the ranch dressing in 1/2, did add 1/4 cup more water. My husband said,"" Don't you dare not cook this roast again!"" Served it with whole wheat bread to sop up the juices and rice-broccoli casserole! Thanks!"
32772,27208,2002-12-03,5,"What can I say buta ""WOW!!!"". This was simple but tasted like I slaved over it all day. I used a 5 pound rump roast sprinkled with the mixture. I poured the rest on the sides and bottom of crockpot. I stayed with the 1/2 cup of water and cooked it on high for one hour and then low for six hours.  It turned out great!! I turned the crockpot to high and mixed two tablespoons of water and flour to thicken the gravy.Served it with Ranch Mashed Potatoes by Lorac. What a combination. To cut down on calories I used low-fat dressing mixes."
64642,27208,2003-01-02,5,"Excellent flavor and very easy to do.  I made it with a really tough cut of beef that I had purchased on sale.  It turned out fork tender.  My family didn't find it too salty at all.  We loved it the first time as it was written, and the second time used red wine instead of water and liked it even better.  My  daughter-in-law asked for the recipe so I'm SURE it was a hit with her.  In any case, there weren't ANY leftovers."
43083,27208,2003-01-23,3,This was a good pot roast but I think i expected a different taste than what I got. I added 1 cup of water instead of half. Overall I might do this again in the future..
37036,27208,2003-03-07,5,"A definite keeper!  As others suggested, I cut the ranch dressing in half, but followed the rest of the recipe as it was posted.  It made a very moist, tender roast with a wonderful flavored gravy!  My picky family loved it!  I will be making this over and over again!  Thanks!!!"
55729,27208,2003-03-19,5,"Even though you don't need any more reviews, I review everything I try, so here goes! I made the recipe exactly as written, with a 2.5lb chuck roast. The flavor & texture were perfect. I was disappointed because the gravy was hard to use - I forgot to trim the fat off the roast & it was swimming with grease. :( However, the texture *would* have been perfect if I wasn't such a dunce! My ""vegetarian"" 3-year-old even ate this willingly, so it is definitely a keeper."
46660,27208,2003-05-01,4,"This was not 'to die for,' but it was tasty!  I used half a package of ranch mix, a whole envelope of brown gravy mix, and I didn't have any italian dressing mix, so I added a big splash of red wine vinegar. I used a full cup of water, as I used a very large roast.  The sauce was yummy!"
13483,27208,2003-05-14,0,Certainly easy to do and it did taste good.  But even using half the ranch dressing it was still far too salty for my taste.  I think this would be great without the ranch dressing.
26512,27208,2003-06-23,5,"Yet another review for the famous roast!
This was delicious. I put the roast on around 10am and used half the seasonings. I cooked it on high for several hours, then tested the ""gravy"" and didn't think it was that salty, so I added the rest of the seasonings and cooked on low for about 5 more hours.
The roast was very tender and the gravy was awesome! I didn't thicken the gravy. I like it on the thin side and I drizzled it over the meat and served with mashed potatoes, veggies and hot rolls. We served some of the juice on the side and dunked hot rolls in it. We loved it! Thanks yooper, an excellent recipe and I'll be serving this again!"
54678,27208,2003-08-05,5,"Very Very Very Good! Used cross rib roast, all the mixes, added potatoes, onions,carrots and used 1 cup water and 1/2 cup cooking sherry. My ancient slow cooker on 9 hours low didn't even get close to cooking vegies and meat so cranked to high for 3 hours.Even better next day as leftovers.MMMMMM "
44383,27208,2003-09-29,5,"As if this one needed another rave review.  This got a resounding thumbs up last night when I made it for Sunday dinner for the clan.  I went really cheap on the roast and had to swim through a lot of fat but the meat, when you could find some, tasted wonderful.  Next time I'll splurge a little more for a better then blade roast.  I too put halved new potatoes in the crockpot first and there weren't enough for those who wanted seconds.
Also, the stuperstore where I shop did not have dried ranch or italian dressing so I substituted french onion and country herb. Gravy was still delicious. Thanks for a great recipe, I'll be doing this one frequently."
93006,27208,2003-10-03,5,"Why add another 5-star comment?  Because this is simply the best pot roast I have ever had, and I was raised on the stuff!  Don't change anything - it was not too salty for us - I used a 4+lb. rump roast.  Even my extremely picky teenager who rarely eats beef loved it!"
59473,27208,2003-10-08,5,I don't think I can say any more about this recipe that hasn't already been said. The roast was so tender and the gravy was delicious. I poured the gravy into a pot and thickened it with cornstarch and water. I will make this again for sure.
60992,27208,2003-11-14,5,"Just as I closed the lid to the crockpot DH walked in and said ""That smells good!""...before it was even cooked! I added carrot strips, new potatoes, mushrooms and onions. when it was all done I thickened up the gravy with a little Bisto. Leftovers were all diced and tossed with the gravy and put into a baking dish and topped with Yorkshire Pudding batter and baked it! Just as yummy the secind time around! Thanks Yoop for sharing this tasty treat!
"
52543,27208,2003-11-24,4,"I combined recipe #63812 for Italian Dressing (made without salt) with Ranch mix & Gravy mix in a bowl - then used half of the mixture with my sirloin tip roast. While the meat was extremely tender, I found the sauce to have way more flavour than the beef. Thanx Yooper!"
101034,27208,2004-01-01,3,"I used a 3 1/2 lb tip roast and followed the recipe exactly as written. The roast itself was  good...it was nice & moist. The gravy seemed to be overpowered by the spice mixes and was very salty. All in all, we found the meal to be ok. "
140132,27208,2004-05-07,5,"Simple and delicious, what could be better then that?  We loved this and will make again and again.  The roast turned out perfect, not mushy or dry, it was moist and sliced perfectly. I didn't add any veggies but will try it the next time. I can't wait for the next time and we just finished the first one!!lol"
146486,27208,2004-06-22,5,"I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I also added celery, potatoes, carrots, and onions to make it a full meal."
98919,27208,2004-07-11,5,"The BEST crockpot roast recipe I think I have ever had.  Simple to prepare, then forget about it until serving time. The only thing I did different was use the Garlic and Herb Italian Dressing Mix and I sprinkled the roast with dry onion flakes. This will be a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!"
121185,27208,2004-08-22,4,"This was a pretty good crock pot roast - SUPER easy.  Not too salty - I halved the ranch and italian.  But, you know how we all are about our comfort foods...I'll stick to my ol' recipe! Thanks for sharing!  (oh- for the record, Mom loved it, hubby really didn't, 11 yr old thought it was ok, 3 yr old loved it with KETCHUP! (ack!) and I thought it was pretty tasty)"
73469,27208,2004-08-26,3,"This wasn't exactly my thing. I found the roast to be too salty. I also didn't care for the taste  of the ranch and itailan dressing packet. However, the roast was very tender ,and for that reason I will give this recipe three stars."
55578,27208,2004-09-11,5,"Can you believe all these reviews?!! Of coarse I had to try it.  And of coarse it's as good as everyone says.  It really is delicious, and SO easy.  Thanks Yooper for the great recipe."
74652,27208,2004-10-07,3,I changed my rating on this because although we didn't like the flavor of the roast it was very tender. It was very easy to make just too salty for our tastes.
149363,27208,2004-11-01,5,"Well, here is another 5 star review! This was awesome, and we all enjoyed it very much. So tender!I used 1/2 packet of ranch dressing as
suggested. I used the other 1/2 packet to season roast potatoes...melt butter and mix 1/2 packet of dressing and toss over potatoes, then roast! Thanks for sharing!"
145352,27208,2004-11-18,5,"It doesn't need another review, but, hey, why not? This was very good. My 3 sons and hubby especially liked it. I used all the ingredients, but like others, rubbed half on meat, and mixed half with the water. I placed cut up onions, potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the crock, and afterwards, I thickened the gravy with some cornstarch on the stovetop. "
175824,27208,2004-11-27,4,"
This was good. I also used 1/2 of the Ranch Dressing. I will be making this again. Thanks Yooper."
128473,27208,2005-03-20,5,"Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe Yooper. I used a 3.5 lb blade roast and sprinkled half of the italian and ranch mixes over the roast.I didn't have any brown gravy mix so I mixed 1/4 cup of beef bovril with water. When the roast was almost cooked, I made a thick gravy then placed the roast into the pot with the simmering gravy. We really enjoyed this tender and spicy dish."
173579,27208,2005-03-29,5,This is a very good tasting pot roast.  Quick and easy.  Very tender and also excellent gravy.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
88099,27208,2005-04-06,3,"This was good, but not great.  My roast was dry, I cooked it exactly 7 hours.  The flavor wasn't all that great, even though I added a small sliced onion and carrots to the mix, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I'll stay with my other roast recipes."
147109,27208,2005-04-11,5,"Okay, what can I say different than what everybody else has posted. I saw this recipe awhile ago somewhere else (can't remember where) and it has been a family staple ever since.  I always serve with mashed potatoes and veggies, which I sometimes just throw right it with the crockpot.  Yummy!!  I have friends that call me and ask when the next time I am going to make it is! If they only knew how easy it really is!!!"
189616,27208,2005-04-14,4,"It was good, but definately not to 'Die For' #11642 Incredible Oven Fried Chicken NOW THATS TO DIE FOR, (and no I'm not the Chef)!"
110078,27208,2005-05-03,5,Absolutely the greatest tasting roast.  I didn't change a thing.  We love to have garlic mashed potatoes with ours.  The leftover juices from the roast make THE BEST gravy.  So simple and so... good!
50969,27208,2005-05-15,4,"i started out using the full pack of gravy and half of the ranch and italian dressing mix.about 5 hours into the cooking time,i tasted it and found it really didn't have that much flavor so i added the rest of the mixes.i wish i could say it was""to die for""but it really wasn't anything that special.i'm sorry, i just don't know if i'll fix it again."
168462,27208,2005-07-16,4,"Very easy to make. I only used a half package of italian dressing and used whole packages of the other mixes. I added carrots and potatoes. I did not find this too salty, but just right. Thanks for the easy recipe."
68960,27208,2005-07-24,4,This is really tasty but surprised me with a thin gravy. I used a 28g envelope of gravy mix. Thanks for posting!
97579,27208,2005-08-06,5,"What else can I say that 443 haven't?  It's very good!  My new recipe for roast.  I added carrots and pearl onions in the last hour or so.  Thickened up the gravy on the stove, served over mashed potatos and we were ready to dig in!  Thanks!"
207176,27208,2005-11-01,5,Outstanding!  Everyone loved  it.  I used a brisket.Didn't have a brown gravy so used a  Knorr chicken gravy powdered mix and it turned out just fine!  I also cooked it only 6 hours on low with potatoes and it was tender and excellent.  Thanks Yooper!
229850,27208,2006-01-10,5,"Just had to rate this again. It was delish. I made it exactly as posted and couldn't have been happier. The flavors blended wonderfully, and I have passed the recipe on. It was a great addition and I thank you!"
8688,27208,2006-01-11,5,"I wish I had bought a larger chuck roast! The taste of this Pot Roast is absolutely fabulous! A meal fit for a queen (...or king)! The seasonings were perfect and it is so incredibly moist it falls apart with your fork!! I wouldn't change one single thing, except next time I may invite company over to share! This one is a definate keeper. Thank you so much, yooper, for sharing this recipe with your 'Zaar buddies! You done (really, really) good. ;) -- posted Jul 8, 2002
Just an update to let you know I am still serving this wonderfully easy and delicious pot roast! This morning, I was in the midst of putting all the ingredients in the crockpot, when lo and behold, I discovered I had no Ranch dressing!  Needing an immediate alternative, I subbed a package of Knorr's French Onion Soup mix.  A decision that proved to be an excellent choice!  I increased the water to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 red wine.  I did add some sliced carrotts and potatoes a couple hours before the roast was done.  Thanks again, and again, Yooper, for sharing!"
278113,27208,2006-01-17,4,"This was pretty good, but we did find it a tad too salty for us, and we used half a package of the ranch seasoning. Still prefer our old standby, but this was a nice change of pace. Thanks for sharing!"
218535,27208,2006-02-12,5,Quick and easy. My family love it. Thanks for posting it.
158086,27208,2006-03-31,5,I just bought myself a new crockpot...have not had one in years...this was a great recipe to try it out on...it was so nice to come home from work and have dinner done...we loved it...it was alittle on the salty side..but we did not care...
232480,27208,2006-04-27,2,"Way, way too salty for us.  The first couple of bites were good, and then after that it was almost like we could feel the sodium coursing through us.  I think I will stick to my own recipe - 1 roast, 1/2 c. water, and 1 envelope onion soup mix.  Even simpler, and tastes better, IMO."
230557,27208,2006-07-05,2,"I'm with those who think there wasn't anything 'to die for' about the flavor of this roast.  I don't know where all those seasonings go too but we thought the roast was pretty bland, other than salty.  Thanks for giving me something easy to make - really can't beat how simple the recipe is."
51011,27208,2006-09-18,5,"Not that this recipe needs another review... But we loved it.  Threw it into my crockpot last Monday morning around 6:45.  Got home around 4:45 and it was perfect.  Only change was to add some carrots to the mix, and they tasted great too.  Thanks yooper for sharing something so easy and good."
227607,27208,2006-10-13,5,"This was wonderful...I used the italian dressing, ranch dressing, and country gravy mix(I did not have any brown gravy mix).  It turned out great.  It was not salty at all for us.  It was fall apart good.  I added some potatoes and carrots to it and served over noodles.  Will definately make many times again."
251917,27208,2006-10-17,5,"Delicious!! Super easy, no fuss dinner with great results! My family loved it! THANK YOU!"
252816,27208,2006-11-20,5,"I read the reviews (not all 467)and decided to use half the Italian dressing. I cooked a 2 1/2 lb roast.I put everything in the crockpot,plugged it in and left for town. Three hours later, I got home and found Id forgotten to turn the crockpot on low. I put the roast in the oven at 300 for 4 hours. It smelled wonderful and turned out to be the best beef roast I've ever made. I put carrots and potatoes in with roast last hour of cooking.Great gravy!!! This is the only way I will cook a roast, making sure from now on that I turn it on...Thank U for this wonderful recipe..."
136997,27208,2006-11-20,4,This came out so very tender with lots of gravy juices. My daughter asked if she could take the leftovers back to college with her. I used salt reduced italien/gravy mix and half a packet of ranch. Nice flavor. :)
125640,27208,2006-12-17,3,"Not bad, but as far as we could see nothing really special either, which was disappointing in light of all the wonderful reviews. I used a 3.5 lb chuck roast, a l oz pkg of herbed gravy mix, an ounce of ranch mix, and a .7 oz pkg of Italian dressing mix, added veggies (baby red potatoes, chopped rutabaga, baby carrots and frozen chopped onions) cooked for 7 hours on LOW and 3 on HIGH. I was really suprised that so many people found this recipe too salty, as we found it pretty bland, even the veggies. We actually added garlic salt and extra ranch powder to our plates after tasting it. I may make this again, but would definately have to play with the seasonings a bit.
-- posted Dec 17, 2006
Have made 2 attempts to make this less bland. The best results seem to come from using as small a roast as I could find (2.16 lbs) the full amounts of seasonings (same herbed gravy, do NOT use zesty Italian as it combines badly with the other seasonings), adding an ounce of cabernet in addition to the water,  a pkg of onion/mushroom soup mix, 4 cloves crushed garlic and a teaspoon of thyme. Much less bland, the veggies especially, but my family still added garlic salt to their plates.
However, I think it's just us. DH took the leftovers out to his parents house and they thought it was really great."
333017,27208,2006-12-20,3,"You have to give this recipe bonus points for being fast and easy.....but I can't say I understand what the big ""who ha"" was about!!!  I had intended to serve this to a large group, but ended up cutting the roast into 3 portions (enough to feed 4).  I divided the mixings into 2 portions (as recommended by others) but used the 1/2 cup water.   I would make this recipe again, but, only to use up the left over roast and seasonings.  While it was tender, the roast appeared grey in colour, which did not appeal to me...so next time, I will cut the cooking time down to 5 - 7 hours and will add veggies.  This roast is good for family, but would I serve this to company?.... a big no!!!!"
185446,27208,2006-12-31,5,Five stars for preparation ease and excellent taste.  The only change was browning the roast beforehand--a must for crockpot meats.  The gravy came straight from the crockpot--no thickening necessary.  Thanks yooper--a dish fit for company fare!
402559,27208,2007-01-19,5,I used an envelope of onion soup mix because I didn't have the brown gravy mix. I rubbed everything on the night before and added some carrots and potatoes. Made gravy out of the drippings. OH MY!! That was the most flavorful and tender roast I have ever made. I have never seen my 2 yr old eat so many carrots. Thank you so much for sharing this one!
316717,27208,2007-03-02,5,this was delicious. not salty at all...but then maybe it was because i added an extra 1/4 cup water. used a cheap a little less than 3 lb. roast. tender and gravy was tasty. i even added 1 package of dried onion soup and even w/ that it didn't get any saltier.
222433,27208,2007-03-08,5,"Very, very good! Thank you!"
262312,27208,2007-05-04,5,"What hasn't aleady been said.  This was to die for.  I added 1/4 water totalling 3/4 cup for extra gravy.  Added onion, celery, carrots, and new potatoes. Next time I'll add some black pepper. Awesome recipe.  Will make many more times.  Thanks for another keeper, yooper!!"
520150,27208,2007-07-06,5,I know you don't need my review - but both my dh & I enjoyed this.  I loved the ease.  Perhaps next time I will add a touch more water so we can have more gravy.  Excellent recipe that I will use again.  Thank you!
426903,27208,2007-08-04,4,"Very good roast. It came out a little salty though, however all of my guest thoroughly enjoyed it. I added potatoes and veggies, and added an extra 1/2 cup of water. The potatoes were very flavorful!!"
353131,27208,2007-11-09,3,"Tried this over the weekend and thought it was good but left something to be desired. Wasn't sure what I needed to do differently. Will probably try it again and tweak it some way. Made it exaclty as written. It wasn't too salty, Just something missing.
Not sure."
265954,27208,2007-10-21,4,"Made this with a 1.82 lb roast, chopped potatoes and baby carrots.  Used 3/4 of the recommended dry seasonings and still came out too salty.  I'd recommend using 1/2 the recommended amount of dry seasonings and, if you're going to add potatoes, carrots, etc., I'd use 1 cup of water.  The roast was very tender.  Thanks for posting!"
173314,27208,2007-11-12,5,This was Soooo tasty! Used 3/4 cup water. I used a chuck roast and did on low for 9 hours! thanks.
447123,27208,2007-11-13,5,WOWSERS this is really a feel good look good taste good meal!!!! I added carrots and potatoes half way through. Also added an extra 1/2 cup of water because I like more sauce. This was so very good that there was none left over. Can't really think of anything that is mre easy. Throw a few things in turn on the pot and let it go. A family pleaser it is!! Thanks so much!!! Eddited to add: Ok we like LOTS of gravy so I went crazy and added not 1/2 cup but 3 and a half cups pf water and it was still divine and not as salty!!EDDITED TO ADD: Alriught I have made this several times now. (at least 4 times) I think the best cut of beef is chuck roast. Also I add 3 cups of water not 1/2. It works out great and doesnt taste like water. It has way more gravy this way!!!
191533,27208,2007-12-06,5,Delicious and simple! I put chunks of potato and carrot under a 5lb. roast; added 2 whole cups of water and the flavor was still great! I strained some of the juice after cooking and thickened it on the stove with cornstarch.
579298,27208,2007-12-09,5,"I am VERY jealous! This roast was BY FAR the BEST roast I have EVER had! I have been trying to perfect my roast since the age of 16 (when my husband and I met). I went from 8 ingredients and 3 extra steps in my recipe, to 3 ingredients and the crock pot does the rest! And OOMMMGGGosh the TASTE is amazing! Yooper, you should get an award for the best pot roast ever. I used a 1.76 lb roast and it turned out more than perfect :) THANKS!"
357358,27208,2008-01-05,3,"I used a 5 pound pot roast and followed the directions exactly. It was very easy to put together. Before serving, I made gravy from the drippings and water by adding flour & milk and cooking it until it thickened. The gravy was delicious. However, the roast was pretty tough and that was disappointing. If I make this again I will not add the water as I think it steamed the roast and was what made it tough."
331557,27208,2008-01-14,5,This was really good.  I could not find dried Italian salad dressing mix in five different grocery stores where I live so I made it with just the ranch and the brown gravy mix.  I also increased the water to 3/4 cup because I have a larger crockpot.  The roast was falling apart when I tried to take it out and it was the best roast I have ever made in the crockpot. Thanks for posting a keeper - even without the Italian dressing!
355637,27208,2008-01-24,4,This was very tasty!
369715,27208,2008-02-11,4,This was good and easy to throw together in the morning. I cooked mine for 6 hours and it was done perfect. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Good recipe using ingredients that I normally have on hand.
178742,27208,2008-02-25,5,"This was one of the very first recipies I found when I joined recipezaar in 2004. And I finally tried it, and I'm glad I did! It came out wonderful. It was not too salty for us.. As a matter of fact, I tasted the mix after I blended it together.. I browned my roast on both sides before I put in crockpot, and i rubbed the dry mixes on both sides of my meat. I also used a cup of water, and my roast weighed 2.22lbs. I cooked it on high for about 5 hours. It could have been 4 1/2 hours, I can't remember if it was 1:30pm or 2:00pm when I put it in. Anyway, it was soooo good and it fell apart when I removed from crockpot. I served with baked potatoes, topped with broccoli, cheese, backon and sour cream. I can not wait make the roast again!
Thanks for sharing!"
497077,27208,2008-05-27,5,It doesn't get any easier than this! Thank you for a great recipe!!!
236170,27208,2008-05-21,5,"Not that this recipe needs another rating - but we loved it! I made it for Sunday dinner when we had my parents over and everyone raved about the flavor of the beef. The gravy was also delicious and super easy to make. I made it in the crockpot for 9 hours with carrots, onions and potatoes on top. What a delicious meal!"
32058,27208,2008-06-22,4,We gave this a 4 at our house.  Likely would not make again.
251626,27208,2008-07-03,5,Delicious!!!
142559,27208,2008-10-12,5,"I was a little leery over this recipe because of so many people saying that it was too salty, so after reading and debating for a day or so, I decided to make this.  I bought a 3lb. top round roast and only used half of the ranch mix (as suggested by others). Instead of Italian mix, I grabbed Cheesy Garlic (Good Seasonings) by accident.  I threw in some onion, carrots, yukon gold potatoes. I did rub some of the dry mix on the roast first and then sprinkled the rest over the meat and veggies.  I used 1 cup of water too (as suggested by others). It made a lot of gravy! It wasn't very thick, so I had to add some cornstarch to make actual gravy. The flavor was very good and I did not find it to be too salty. Next time I will use the full ranch packet. Thanks for posting, the roast came out beautifully!!"
969481,27208,2008-11-14,5,"This is very quick and easy to put together. I am a working mom and before I put the kids on the bus, I can put this in the crock pot with some red potatoes (halved), sliced onions and some baby carrots and the family dinner is ready when we get home. Serve with a tossed salad. Thanks for posting!"
74281,27208,2008-12-16,5,"We absolutely loved this recipe! I did take the advice and used only 1/2 packet of the Ranch Dressing mix. Put the dry mix over a 3-lb frozen rump roast for 10 hours on low. When I got home from work I added about 2 cups of water with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch into the pot with a bag of Ore-Ida Roasted Original Potatoes and turned the crock pot up to high for 1 hour. We had delicious roast with potatoes and gravy that everyone loved!! Of course with 920 mostly great reviews before me, I sort of guessed this would be great!! Thanks Yooper for posting this wonderful recipe that will be used a lot in our house."
914720,27208,2009-03-06,5,"973 reviews can't be wrong.  This was spectacular.  I used 1/2 pack of ranch mix, a low sodium brown gravy mix, and 1 oz of recipe#63812 . I added a sliced onion and 1 lb of baby carrots to the bottom of the crock pot, browned the chuck roast, and deglazed the pan with the water to add to the crock pot.  I also thickened the gravy with a cornstarch slurry just before serving.   The meat and gravy had great flavor, and the meat was fork tender.  This will definitely be my go to pot roast recipe.  Thanks for sharing!"
226863,27208,2009-03-11,5,"Because of the comments about saltiness, I wanted to reduce my mix ingredients.  All of my packages of mixes were less than the 1 1/4 oz amount, so I just used one of each....most were around 0.8 oz.  This was very good, and my DS has asked that I make it again.  So this will be going in the keeper file!  Made for All New Zaar Cookbook Tag Game."
124190,27208,2009-03-16,5,"Not that it needs any more wonderful reviews....BUT, this was wonderful! I used a three pound chuck roast, and subbed basil and oregano for the Italian dressing mix. Very yummy. I figured it to be about 9 weight watchers points per serving of meat with 8 servings total. Thanks for a great recipe! UPDATED 3/16: This recipe freezes well. I pulled a  ziploc bag of frozen leftovers from the freezer, defrosted in the microwave, and it was just as delicious as when I put it in."
879716,27208,2009-06-08,5,"This was good and easy.  I had a lean roast (eye of round) that is best cooked to medium rare.  I think the spice mix would have been much more of a main player for a fattier cut of beef that was falling apart when taken out of the pot.  Still, the roast had a great taste and I'll definitely use this again.  Thanks so much!"
286851,27208,2009-07-12,5,"I made this a long time ago, and I just now realized I hadn't reviewed it (as I am about to make it again!) Very tasty, very easy. Cut the ranch dressing down some, per other reviewers' suggestions. Thanks for sharing."
1365025,27208,2009-12-14,3,It was okay but just not for me. I am going to try it again but this time I'll use the brown gravy mix and a pkg of onion soup mix.
637486,27208,2010-01-24,5,"Not that this recipe needs another review, but here it is.  This was my first attempt at making pot roast, and I can now say that I will be making it again!  My roast was just under 3 pounds, and the seasoning packages were the small ones, about half the size you listed.  Even though the seasoning packets were smaller, I didn't use all of it because it just seemed like to much.  I added about 5 potatoes cut into large chunks and a couple of handfuls of baby carrots to the crock pot.  I sprinkled some of the remaining seasoning mix on the veggies.  I thought the meat came out a little chewy, but this could be the cut I used....at any rate, we loved it!"
1133190,27208,2010-02-17,4,"The flavor of the roast was great, however I was unsure as to what size of a roast to get since it is not indicated in the recipe.  I got a smaller roast (a little under 3 lbs) and it turned out a bit dry, probably because it cooked too long and I only cooked it for around 6 hrs.  Though, I did like the mixture of seasonings (I used about half of all three packets) I prefer something I can make with   spices I already have on hand.  I also added carrots and celery halfway through cooking and they tasted wonderful."
386849,27208,2011-01-04,0,Cant remember how this tasted but I did make it so I wanted to flag it as such.
305531,27208,2011-08-06,5,I've made this roast for years but just discovered that I had never reviewed it before. This is a great recipe and our favorite way to have roast. Thanks yooper for sharing the recipe. Made for All You Can Cook Buffet special.
774665,27208,2011-08-27,5,"I did not want to believe this recipe would be good but it was GREAT!!!! I just added yellow potatoes and they go perfect with this roast. I highly recommend yellow potatoes to take this recipe to the next level. I didn't change the gravy one bit--ate it right out of the crock pot, and it doesn't need thickening at all. Perfect."
1052873,27208,2011-09-15,5,"I was going to try homemade seasoning mixes but then chickened out and bought the real thing for the first try. I used 1/2 pack of Italian seasoning and 1 cup of water. Put quartered potatoes on top next to the side. Low 10 hours, warm about 3. Tasty."
350750,27208,2011-10-28,5,This was excellent.  I did use only 1/2 ranch pkt and added vegetables. Thanks for a great recipe!
126104,27208,2012-05-12,5,"I'll add one more review.  My issues were with the ounces and the packages I got at my small market, and I think I used too much of something, BUT it was excellent.  My roast was a tad overdone cooking it 7 hours, so I will reduce the cooking time next time.  I will also add the potatoes and carrots long before I did this time.  We had to nuke those so we could eat.  New crockpot; new recipe.  This, like so many other reviewers, will be my standard recipe now for roasts.  I will get more packets and make sure I have everything but the roast on hand when I want a good meal.  Excellent."
203325,27208,2012-06-09,5,I threw in some carrots and potatoes for a simple meal.
377039,27208,2012-09-23,5,"Previously, I rated this poorly, and I'm updating to apologize!  Yes, the meat falls apart to the point that it's more of a stew-in-gravy than a pot roast. However, my husband has BEGGED me to make this at least once a month- and that's reason enough to rate it as a five-star recipe!  Because it falls apart so completely, I simply stir to make a meat-in-gravy sauce and pour over pasta or rice :)  As a pot roast, this is two stars. As a creamy meaty sauce, it's 6 stars! (Just don't add salt... it's quite salty on its own)"
2549237,27208,2012-12-23,5,This recipe is AMAZING!  I came home from Christmas shopping and the house smelled so good and when it came time to eat everyone had seconds including my 6 y.o. DS and my 2 y.o. DS who are very picky.  There was plenty of gravy to mix in potatoes and carrots before serving.  Will definitely make this again!
456858,27208,2013-09-25,3,"Well.....this wasn&#039;t to die for, for me anyway.  Simple to prepare, it was, but I thought it would have been a lot more tender. IDK if I was supposed to have enough water to cover the roast, but I followed directions and only added 1/2 cup of water.  I did cook mine on low for 8 hours. I MIGHT make again."
1581225,27208,2016-10-25,4,"Pretty good recipe, very simple to prepare, although I made my dressing mixes from scratch (no dry dressing mix in Aus). The flavour was good, but I still prefer my roast in the oven."
149363,27643,2007-04-09,5,"This turned out perfectly! I was feeding a crowd, so I doubled it and put it in a crockpot on low for 3 hours and it was great, everyone really enjoyed it.
Thanks for a great recipe Junebug!"
37779,35393,2003-05-18,5,"Our strawberries  turned out really great this year and I used them in this muffin recipe. They had a wonderful juicy berry flavor. Very moist and tender. All in my family loved them and there were none left-over. I didn't use paper cups, just greased my muffin tin and they came out fine. Thanks for posting this recipe."
92816,35393,2003-09-08,4,Nice moist muffins.I did not have enough strawberries so I added some blueberries also.It changed the flavor quite a bit instead of just having strawberries but very good all the same.I also added 1 tsp vanilla.
91392,35393,2004-04-18,5,"I replaced the oil with applesauce, and made the recipe in a square pan, as for a snack cake.  Worked great, and got the fat out of it.  A real quick, easy, keeper!"
119466,35393,2005-06-05,4,"Nice, moist muffins that are very quick and easy to make. I followed your recipe exactly, except I did sprinkle turbinado sugar on the tops prior to baking. I must fill my muffin cups a little fuller, though, because I ended up with only 10 muffins. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
124190,35393,2005-06-16,4,"These were tasty, and very easy to make. Cooking temp and time were right on. Thanks!"
97579,35393,2005-06-23,4,These were very moist.  A dab of butter and I was loving it!  I might sprinkle a bit of sugar on top next time to sweeten it a bit more for my taste.  Thanks!!
227607,35393,2006-05-10,5,"I realized that I could not find a muffin pan after making this so I used a 9x13 pan(I had doubled the recipe).  I used half wheat flour and used splenda for the sugar.  They turned out great.  I cut them into squares and wrapped them in color plastic wrap for the kids lunches.  Great, easy recipe."
104295,35393,2006-10-07,5,"I took Kasha's lead and made it with no oil (applesauce) and in a pan for bars.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour.  While the texture was a tad less then my kids would like, that was due to my subs!  Great flavor and easy to put together using frozen berries.  Thanks!"
182624,35393,2007-05-06,4,Delicious muffins and a great way to use up strawberries.  They didn't last long!  My 2-yr-old especially loved them.  Thanks for sharing!
64203,35393,2007-06-03,5,"These are very good muffins. My 5 year old and 3 year old made them with my assistance. The recipe is simple to follow and the end result is a tasty, flavorful muffin!"
307214,35393,2007-07-12,4,"Just the recipe to use up the last of my fresh strawberries.  I doubled the recipe, and cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan (about 30 minutes).  Next time I will try substituting whole wheat flour and applesauce.  Makes a nice snacking cake."
407007,35393,2007-08-09,5,"wow!!! this was my first time making muffins of any kind, so I was a little nervous -- but I figured I couldn't go wrong with a kid-friendly recipe! these impressed me by being EVEN better than I thought they would be! I followed the recipe exactly and this is one of the few I would not change a SINGLE thing about! PERFECT recipe! I especially loved these out of the oven when the strawberries were warm and gooey! mm! will be looking forward to snacking on these this week. thanks for a keeper!"
394077,35393,2008-04-06,3,These were easy to make but I don't care for the texture of the muffins.  The flavor was also OK.
56087,35393,2008-04-20,5,Five stars for excellent flavor and ease of preparation.  I will make this again the only difference will be that I will not use paper liners as the strawberries stuck to the paper and you lose half the muffin.  Next time I'll just spray the muffin pan or do as another reviewer said and bake as a snack cake.  Thanks for sharing.
168462,35393,2008-04-21,5,"These are wonderful muffins and you can really taste the strawberries in them. I made them exactly as written except I had to use up a few berries, so I ended up adding 2 cups of berries. I cooked mine at 350 and they were done perfectly at 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe."
218535,35393,2008-05-27,2,My muffin came out too dry. At 15 minutes my muffin still wet in the middle. My family didn't care for these muffins at all. Update: Recipe #22698 is better
59473,35393,2008-06-19,5,These muffins tasted great and were  so easy to make. I used oil but I will try applesauce the next time to see the difference. thanks
439797,35393,2009-01-29,5,These were great.  I had some homemade canned strawberries that I used.  Sprinkled with sugar on top and cooked 17 minutes.  Made exactly 12.  They are going quickly.  Everyone has already had 2!
666723,35393,2009-03-19,4,"These were very easy to make with the little 10 year old girl I take care of.  We also had all of the ingredients on hand and needed to use some strawberries that were on hand.  While they didn't get eaten up as soon as other desserts in their house, they were enjoyed and I would make them again.  I'd also try with other berries like raspberries."
92886,35393,2009-04-18,3,"I served these to company and my eight year old nephew declared ""these don't have any taste.""  Now I didn't take it too seriously because an eight year old boy is hardly the best judge of good food.  But I did think they lacked a little something ( another reviewer suggested a little brown sugar and extra cinnamon.)  I did enjoy them and was pleased to be able to use fresh seasonal fruit."
369715,35393,2009-06-14,5,Very good and easy to make. My son and I have been picking strawberries so I had a bunch to use up. I made two batches of these and will freeze some. I followed the recipe exactly as written and we all enjoyed them. I have a convection oven so I converted the temperature for my oven and cooked at 375 for 18 minutes. I got 11 muffins from both batches.
632249,35393,2009-09-28,5,I used a mixture of fresh strawberries and frozen raspberries/blackberries to make these delightful muffins.  I made as written and they turned out perfect.  I think the reviews that say there is not enough flavour are due to the quality/flavour of the berry itself.  My berries were gorgeous and the flavour came thru wonderfully. Thx for posting!
140132,35393,2010-06-09,4,These are really good.  I made them for brunch one morning and my family enjoyed them very much.  Thank you for sharing.
540346,35393,2011-04-12,0,"Fantastic.  I used all strawberries and added in one mashed banana.  I also cut the sugar down to about 1/3 c, used applesauce in place of the oil, and used whole wheat flour.  These were so moist and delicious.  For me this recipe made 14 regular muffins (cupcake size).   I love them and my kids did, too.  NOTE: DO NOT USE the paper liners.  We lose about 1/3 of the muffin as it sticks to the liner.  However, the mini-muffins I made and sprayed with non-stick spray came out perfectly."
470351,35393,2011-05-14,0,"VERY good!  I had to sub baking powder in place of the baking soda but followed the rest, as stated, with all strawberries.  I cooked for 15 minutes, but would probably cook a bit less next time.  Super quick and easy.  Will definitely make again."
242484,35393,2014-01-01,3,"I used frozen strawberries and I just wasn&#039;t happy with the outcome...too dense, didn&#039;t rise up, flavor was just okay.  It may have been because the frozen berries added too much extra liquid than fresh, even though I did drain them."
64583,24476,2003-01-20,5,I made this as a side dish to carmelized garlic chicken and my whole family loved it.  Very easy and much less salty tasting than actual Rice-a-Roni.  Thanks!
51011,24476,2003-03-05,5,"I made this tonight and it was sooooo good and easy!! I loved that I get to choose what i want in it.  The only thing i did different was i added 1 clove of garlic and 1/4 onion chopped at the begining.

My husband is pretty picky, so this is nice because i can make his (beef- will use beef instead of chicken broth) and mine (this recipe) without having to waste 1/2 a box of each.

Thanks so much for sharing this! I will definatly have to make this again!"
59780,24476,2003-05-13,5,What a great recipe! I found this while I was planning for supper and I even had all the ingredients in the house! I added the onion and garlic as suggested by another reviewer and it was delicious! I look forward to trying out other variations with this recipe and I make this often. Thanks for sharing this easy side dish!
37036,24476,2003-06-27,5,"So simple, yet delicious!  I'll never buy the boxed rice-a-roni again!  I followed the directions using chicken broth and adding 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, 1/2 teaspoon dried onion flakes, and 1 teaspoon dried chives.  I brought it to a boil, then reduced the heat to medium and simmered uncovered until the liquid was absorbed (about 15-20 minutes).  I can't wait to experiment with other ingredients!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!"
160974,24476,2005-05-24,5,"I make this all the time and we all love it. I saute   the spaghetti and rice in a skillet (sometimes oil if I'm out of butter) and cook the rice in my pressure cooker. This is very kid-friendly and a great comfort food.

Roxygirl in Colo."
222433,24476,2006-04-08,5,Wow! I was surprised! This was really good stuff! The boxed rice is so high in sodium and other preservatives. What a great substitute. My kids loved this. Thanks Lisa!
95743,24476,2006-04-30,5,"Delicious.  I used whole wheat pasta, brown rice and took others' suggestions adding slivered almonds, parsley, chives, 1/2tsp garlic powder, 1/2tsp onion powder, 3/4tsp salt and increased the homemade broth to 3 1/2cups. I browned the rice in olive oil, simmered it for 20 minutes then added the pasta (pre-browned in another pan) and simmered for another 25 minutes.  Worked beautifully and is much healthier."
22015,24476,2007-03-22,5,Excellent!   This was so good.   I thought it was different tasting than rice a roni but I loved the toasty flavor of the spaghetti.   This is a definite keeper that we will be serving again at my house.
59163,24476,2007-09-15,5,I wish I had found this years ago.  I've made it once a week now for the past month. Trying out different variations each time.  Made enchiladas and this.  Just added some taco seasoning and some onion and garlic it was a nice addition to the enchiladas.  Took some to my young nephew who just moved out on his own and he devoured it!  Have also put in on our board at work and several have taken the recipe to try. Thanks!
248023,24476,2007-10-10,3,"My BF and I both grew up on rice a roni, so I thought I would make a homemade version of it to go with tonight's dinner.  It was quick and easy enough to prepare and cook.  I used homemade chicken stock and butter.  We both thought it was a good simple side dish... a change from plain white or brown rice. I served it with Recipe #17141 and  Recipe #143043. I liked the fact that you can control the sodium and that it is so cheap.  LOVED the fact that it is very easy to replicate the ""real thing"" and might try it again with beef stock and some mushrooms... Thanks for sharing!"
177933,24476,2007-11-12,5,"This is soooo good! I am so happy to be able to make this home made, the box stuff has so much in it I don't want my family to eat. Today I made it with chicken broth for my kids and they gobbled it up. I am also making it again tonight for my husband, but a beef version. I will be adding sauteed mushrooms and peas to it and I know it will be wonderful! This one will make a weekly appearence on our dinner table! Thanks! **11/12/07 - I thought it worth mentioning that tonight I used orzo pasta instead of the vermicelli with great results.  Much easier not having to break up the pasta."
222055,24476,2007-11-29,5,Thank you so much LisaA! This worked out perfectly!
386849,24476,2007-12-07,4,Great recipe- if you use brown rice be sure to add a lot more time and broth. Will definitely make again!
131021,24476,2008-01-03,5,"I learned how to make home made rice-a-roni on 30 minute meals with Rachel Ray. Thank you for taking the time to write it down. I add chopped onion and garlic at the beginning or use powdered if I am short on time or energy. I also add whatever frozen veggies I have near the end corn, peas or carrots. My kids love it and I know there is at least one thing on the plate they will eat."
140132,24476,2008-01-24,5,"Delicious.  I like the fact that I always have these ingredients in the cupboard.  This was so much better then the ""boxed"" stuff.  It wasn't so salty.  I will never go back, this tasted better and was better for us....thank you....Stephanie"
489552,24476,2008-09-08,5,Great great recipe! and so easy to make.  Both my daughter's couldn't believe I made it and asked that I make if often.  Thank you so much for a great side dish recipe.
579298,24476,2008-11-29,5,"Very very very good! And let me tell you... it is so reasurring to know what EXACTLY your are eating, compared to the processed box stuff ;) I even used brown rice and 100% whole wheat pasta and it was AWESOME! You can't beat this simple and tasty recipe! - We like to add 1 packet of Italian Dressing mix to the simmering liquid. It is easy and kicks it up a notch!"
136997,24476,2009-07-20,5,"Simple, easy and very tasty. I used vegetable broth, as my son is a vegetarian, but would be equally as good made with any other flavoured broth. I added some onion and carrot to the mix and finished with some chopped parsley. I sauteed the rice/pasta in a combination butter/oil, added the stock, brought to a boil and finished in the oven. I generally have more luck with the rice not sticking in the pot that way. Perfect. :)"
937635,24476,2010-05-07,5,"Awesome! I made this to go alongside Recipe #34499 and it was perfect! I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic and about 1/2 cup of sweet onion before adding the noodles and added another tbs of butter before adding the rice. I thought I had spaghetti and realized I was out at the last minute, so I subbed macaroni (next smallest pasta I had on hand). It was kind of funny looking, but tasted spectacular. My hubby finished the WHOLE bowl! Thank you for the great recipe!"
50969,24476,2010-06-01,4,"On 5/31/10  I was looking for something different to go with fried chicken, and came across this recipe and decided to try it. And I'm really glad I did. For the pasta, vermicelli was used. I did have to simmer for about 35  minutes to get the rice completely done. And I added a bit of powdered chicken bouillon to get the flavor that I was used to in the boxed mix. When this is made again, the amount of bouillon will be decreased so I can slowly get the extra sodium out. I can see extras being added to this recipe to make it a one dish meal. Thanks for posting and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
312577,24476,2010-08-19,0,YUMMM!!  I added garlic and onions and some seasonings such as italian seasoning.  I think that this is one of these recipes that is open for interpretation.  My boyfriend was so excited to get homemade rice a roni.  I am so glad I found this recipe.  Thank you!!
1179225,24476,2011-09-28,5,"Just what I was craving! I added dried minced onions, garlic powder and a wee bit of salt. Came out great. Will be making again soon. Thanks for posting!"
2041603,24476,2011-10-26,4,The first time we did this I used brown rice and had to add two extra cups of water and cook about 20 minutes longer.  I used parboiled rice the second time and upped it to about 1 1/4 cups. We added onion and garlic and can't wait to try again with other spices. Very good and versatile.
383346,24476,2012-02-26,5,I used angel hair pasta.  I liked that there was just a little bit of butter and the taste was amazing.  Thanks Lisa :)  Made for all you can cook buffet
176615,24476,2013-09-24,5,Simple dish that everyone enjoyed. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
128473,24476,2016-05-13,5,"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe Lisa. The rice was quick and easy to make with excellent results. It had a soft and tender texture with a lovely subtle flavor. I made a very basic version for my dh. Chicken stock, vermicelli noodles and jasmine rice, he was over the moon. We will be enjoying this comfort food often. Made for What's on the Menu? Tag Game."
59473,104248,2004-11-27,5,Talk about easy. This was great and no mess. I didn't bother to butter the toast. I really don't need the extra calories. I will be making my eggs like this from now on. Thanks for a great recipe.
40961,104248,2004-12-09,5,I made this for myself this morning and it was easy and delicious. I can't wait to make if for the rest of the family. Thanks for posting:)
37636,104248,2004-12-17,4,"I tried this out today because it looked quick and seemed like fun (besides the fact I had not eaten breakfast yet). I made it a couple of times- first at 60% power which made the yolk hard, then at 50% power, and the yolk was runny in spots and hard in others. I wll try this again, but will go for it at 40% power. It tastes great, but the timing needs to be fiddled with, as everyone's microwave will cook it slightly different. It is important to keep it rotating (I don't have a turntable) so I turned it after 20 seconds, then every 10 seconds, then about every 5 seconds as it was close to being done. Thanks for posting!"
68460,104248,2005-01-11,4,"This was a great little breakfast for me this morning as I was running late.  I don't like any runny yolk at all so it took one minute, 20 seconds on 70% power to get my egg just right.  I used rye bread for the toast.  Thanks for the recipe Trisha!"
104295,104248,2005-01-16,3,"I was craving something with protein and needed it quickly so I tried this. I found that the bread (even with toasting) got really soggy and my egg was always overcooked.  That said, I think I may still come back to this if I am in a desperate pinch.  Thanks so much for posting it, Trisha! "
189616,104248,2005-02-13,5,"My 5 year old son loved this! I like how it melted into the toast, insured him eating both the egg and the toast without the egg sliding off the toast. A few quick swipes with the pizza cutter, all set and ready to eat."
95743,104248,2005-09-08,4,My bread got a little rubbery but not bad.  You certainly can't get any faster or easier.
35526,104248,2005-09-09,4,Worked well.  I brought a piece of tast and an egg to work and was able to have a hot breakfast with little fuss and no mess. I will make this again.
101823,104248,2005-09-29,4,Such a simple method for a quick meal.  I used multigrain bread and found that 45 seconds at 60% power was almost too much time in my microwave.
29782,104248,2005-09-30,5,This is totally a good idea. Its simple and very easy and even suitable for kids to make themselves. Its also a quick on the go breakfast on them rush days. Thanks for sharing this quick breakfast! Its a keeper for sure!
132764,104248,2005-10-02,5,"I've never done eggs in the microwave before because I don't want the yolks hard, but seeing the pics attached to this recipe, I decided to try it this morning. Two pieces of toast, two eggs, 1 min on high. Nearly perfect! Next time I think I'll do it for just a little less time because the yolks were just beginning to cook. I'll be using this recipe often. Thanks so much for sharing it with us, and thanks to the wonderful photographers who led me to try this once and for all!!"
13483,104248,2005-10-09,5,What a super quick fix for breakfast or a snack!!  Really easy to do. I found 1 min too long for me.  With my microwave about 50 sec or less was great for a runny yolk. Thanks for the post Trisha W
169969,104248,2005-10-10,5,Saw Sylvies photo i the photo forum and went straight to the kitchen and popped this in the microwave. So easy. I cooked mine for 60 seconds at 60% and it was perfect! Thanks for posting this easy and wonderful sandwich!!!
74652,104248,2005-10-16,4,I made this for breakfast before work the other day and it was really good.  Perfect for when you are in a hurry and need something good and fast! Thanks for sharing!
98919,104248,2005-10-22,5,"Fast, easy, no mess.  What more could you ask for!  A keeper..thanks for sharing."
103876,104248,2005-11-06,5,This turned out perfect!  I know I will be making this often as I am trying to get some extra protein in my diet.  Thanks for the idea.
173314,104248,2006-06-04,5,"five stars for ease, simplicity, and taste-it hit the spot this morning when not alot of time!"
218535,104248,2006-09-24,4,Quick and easy.
124249,104248,2006-10-11,5,"I liked this quick little breakfast. All the egg yolk ( my favorite part of the egg) went into the toast and not on the plate.

Thanks Trisha W.

bullwinkle."
47907,104248,2007-03-06,5,This was so easy!  Poached eggs are one of my favorite breakfasts and this just turned out wonderfully. I microwaved for about 1 minute on high and it worked out great.  Thanks so much for posting a keeper!
37779,104248,2007-05-23,4,"A quick, easy, and filling breakfast.  The edges of the toast did get somewhat tough and chewy. But, overall, I enjoyed this for breakfast. Used whole wheat toast. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
132383,104248,2008-06-28,5,"I really liked the ease of this.  I found my bread was a little tough, but that is made up for with the convenience of not washing pans!  I don't eat breakfast most days but now that I am pregnant, I am looking for easy things I can do while at work. This will be done at work a lot!  Thanks for posting."
499050,104248,2008-09-05,4,Very Good!
37305,104248,2009-01-29,5,"Wow!  What can I add?  I love poached eggs but I'm the only one in my house who does, so this was perfect for me.  My microwave is super powerful, so I only needed 40 seconds on 60%.  Breakfast in under a minute!  White was done, yolk was semi-set but still a bit liquidy in the center and my toast did not get soggy!  Thanks soooo much for posting this. NOTE: I wanted to add that the type of plate you use could change your cooking time.  I used a stoneware plate last time I made these.  That type of plate  apparently sucks all the heat in instead of letting it cook the food.  I was doing 2 eggs and they took almost 4 minutes, but the plate was so hot I couldn't pick it up.  I'll never use this method with stoneware again!"
1072593,104248,2009-04-19,5,Five stars for such a creative and nifty idea.  Easy enough for a child to prepare and quick enough for a on-the-go breakfast for adults.
369715,104248,2012-04-24,3,I made this for my son and I for breakfast. I have to agree with others that the egg is good but my bread was too chewy. We ate the middle of the bread and left the crust as it was a bit hard to chew. You do need to play with the times for your microwave. My first egg was a bit harder then the second.
60992,119466,2005-12-20,5,"I started these later in the day than I would have liked and since I was NOT going to stay up past midnight I cooked them on low for 8 hours instead. So with the extra cook time I halved the amount of water and sugar to accomodate. I also used 8oz of bulk Italian sausage for a portion of the ground beef. Leftover Muscat was the wine. The smells wafting through the house and into my dreams was incredible! I also can not say enough for the texture of this klop, light and satiny smooth yet compact. I served these over parsley buttered noodles with roasted carrots on the side. The only thing I will do differently in the future is thicken the ""gravy"" more , I had a great deal of it even with cutting the water in half. This is a must try if you won a crockpot!"
60989,119466,2008-07-21,5,"Wonderful! I used reisling for the wine. The sauce was a bit sweet for our tastes, but the klops... I can not say enough about these meatballs. Tender, light and simply the best meatballs I have ever made. Just terrific. Thank you!"
35526,83203,2004-03-25,4,These were good but needed something.  I made exactly to recipe.  Very tender and juicy meat but needed something to kick it up a nitch.
37868,83203,2005-07-24,5,I have had this in my recipebook for long time. Thinking my brother and his wife would love a big change from what I was cooking I desided to make this recipe. Well I sure am glad I did. Oh the Smell in my house was so very good. The taste was much better. I did not change anything.  I do not think I would change anything the next time. Thank You for a wonderful recipe. Please know you can freeze your thighs and reheat is just as great. Thank You so very much for a wonderful recipe for my family. Lots of Hugs
145352,83203,2005-08-23,5,"Very delicious and so simple!! I prepared exactly as written and loved it. Served it with steamed rice. I almost doubled the sauce recipe cuz my DH loves lots, but glad I didn't...this makes plenty. "
229524,83203,2007-11-03,5,FANTASTIC FLAVOR!! Marinated mine over night as a few other people had suggested.  It's an easy dinner to fix for a weeknight. Served it over white rice with some fresh broccoli.  Thanks Petunia for finding this delicious recipe.
37779,83203,2008-04-02,5,"Husband, kids and I loved this chicken recipe. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and thoroughly flavored. Made lost of tasty sauce which I made healthier by extracting the oil. Thanks, Petunia. Will be making this one again."
13483,83203,2008-04-02,5,Not much I can add to what has already been said!!  I did dilute the soy with a bit of mirin and water to cut down on the salt a bit   and it seemed to work.  I also removed the skin and did not miss it at all.  Very easy recipe to  and it sure tasted great.  Thanks Petunia for posting this.
666723,83203,2008-05-06,5,"5 Million Stars!!  This dish is a winner.  I used this as a marinade and did it for 24 hours.  Such a great idea... the thighs were so tender and juicy and soaked in all that flavor so well.  I did add some onion powder, some cayenne pepper for heat, and some fresh ginger as well as the ground.  Served it over white rice, and used the juices to pour over the rice.  Steamed broccoli, red peppers and mushrooms on the side.  Can't wait to make this again next week."
207176,83203,2008-11-02,4,The sesame oil made this smell so fantastic while it was cooking.  My kids were asking what was for dinner.  I added extra garlic powder and used the leg-thigh quarters.  It was very good but I will thicken the sauce next time.  It was good but rolled off the chicken a bit.  I love that it wasn't too sweet.  Thanks!
844554,83203,2009-01-12,5,If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I inhaled these! So tasty. I used drumsticks since that was all I had. Used onion powder instead of green onions. Will use this over and over. Thanks. UPDATE: 1-11-09. Made these again and I still love them. I used bone in chicken breasts but next time I'll go back to thighs or drumsticks.
126440,83203,2009-04-08,5,I cut this down for two thighs and we thought it was great.  I did marinate for two hours and used fresh ginger.
331557,83203,2009-04-13,4,This was pretty good.  I made as directed except I cut down the recipe by half and even then cut down on the seasame oil a bit.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs as I can't abide skin on chicken - I also used fresh grated ginger in place of the ground.  I will definitely make this again.  Served with rice and roasted asparagus.  Thanks for posting!
140132,83203,2009-09-03,5,This dish is very good.  I made these tonight  and my family loved how moist and tender the meat was and the glaze on the outside was delicious.  I made 8 thighs and there were none left.  thank you for sharing something different for us.
1365025,83203,2009-12-12,5,"This was excellent. I only had chicken legs on hand. I only used 1/4 cup soy sauce so it would not over power the other ingredients but I also added 1/4 cup teriyaki marinade I had left in the refrigerator that I wanted to get rid of. I cut the honey down to 2 tbs. so it wouldn't be too sweet. I cooked it in my Nesco roaster for 1/2 hr., then thickened it with cornstarch and cooked it on med. heat until the rice was through cooking 20 min. later. The chicken was moist and tasty and the sauce was delicious, not too much soy sauce, not too sweet. A keeper for sure."
653438,83203,2010-03-12,5,"Made this last night for dinner and WOW!   I only used 4 thicken thighs with skin and the bones but used the full amount of sauce.  I did marinate them for about 2 1/2 hours and then baked them.  I used fresh ginger, 1 large clove of garlic minced and added about 1/4 tsp. chili garlic sauce for some kick.  Oh yes, as some other reviews suggested I added just a little cornstarch (to thicken a little) and about 1 1/2 Tbls. of brown sugar (for more sweetness).   The chicken was soooo moist and flavorful...just perfectly done!   Served with Recipe#160213#160213 and Recipe#347607#347607.  What a fabulous meal...DH wants this again next week!    Thank you for a wonderful recipe to put in my Favorites of 2010."
1072593,83203,2010-03-17,5,"I was fishing for compliments from my dad.  Eventually he said in his poor English, ""We loved dem and dat's all dat mattas.""  He cracks me up."
189616,83203,2010-07-09,5,This is a keeper-we all loved it. I did put this under the broiler so the skin to get crusty. Served this with recipe#420690 and recipe#71739
55729,83203,2010-10-23,4,"I made this with 12 thighs (1.5 times the recipe) in my roasting pan. I accidentally used 3/4 tsp. of ginger instead of 3/8 tsp. because I got distracted. That didn't seem to be too much but I might try using the correct amount next time. I was happy that only a few bites of chicken tasted plain and the rest tasted wonderful. Therefore, although I might marinate in the future, it is also a good last-minute recipe. I served this with Recipe #43390."
383346,83203,2011-04-20,5,So yummy.  Thanks Petunia :)  Made for I recommend tag game
394077,83203,2012-01-24,5,"So easy and so good.  This is a keeper recipe especially for all the working mom. I added 1 tablespoon of garlic chili because my family likes spicy food.  Everything else was the same. Man, is it good. I used the same amount ingredients on 14 drumsticks."
133174,83203,2012-02-12,5,"Boneless, skinless chicken thighs were used and cutting the cooking time to about 45 minutes.  The sesame oil and honey were both reduced somewhat.  After the chicken came out moist and tender, the sauce was placed in a pan on top of the stove and a touch of cornstarch added to thicken.  The thickened sauce was spooned over the chicken and then it was sprinkled lightly with sesame seeds.  I will be making this one again."
532289,83203,2012-09-03,5,"Very good.  I mixed everything and placed in a bag and marinated for 2 hours.  Cooked as directed.  When it was done I removed the chicken from the pan and added a bit of cornstarch to the liquid.  I cooked that on the stove-top until it was thick and served with the chicken.  (It didn't need it, but the kids loved adding to their rice).  Very good and moist chicken."
1179225,83203,2012-12-16,5,"Delicious! Lots of flavor, and easy to pull together. I used half the amount of sesame oil called for and used skinless thigh, just to cut back on fat. We're looking forward to the leftovers. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
400708,83203,2013-02-02,5,"Made this last night for dinner and it was GREAT.  Loved the sticky, thick glaze that ended up on the chicken and the ease of just popping it in the oven and letting it bake.  Taste like something you really worked on.  The only thing I changed was to cut the recipe in half for the two of us and marinade the chicken with the sauce in the fridge for about 4 hours prior to baking, and I wouldn't change a thing otherwise.  The thighs came out moist and flavorful.  This is going in my Best of 2013"
185446,83203,2013-02-07,4,"We don't eat chicken thighs often, but they frequently go on sale at the grocery store.  This recipe is a good way to take advantage of cheaper chicken cuts, yet enjoy a flavorful meal.  Thanks, Petunia, I didn't change a thing and our family enjoyed every bite."
839492,83203,2013-08-08,5,"I used reduced sodium soy sauce &amp; 1 T. sesame oil (trust the other reviewer that stated too much sesame oil will ruin a dish) &amp; bone in chicken thighs. This was so tender &amp; delicious. I let it marinate in a freezer bag overnight, used sliced vidalia onion (which carmalized beautifully while baking). This will be a repeat in our house for sure. Note: I baked, covered with foil for about 45 minutes and then removed cover for an additional 20 minutes. Kids all but licked their plates. Served with Recipe #133513 (which we thought was just ok) &amp; Recipe #65287 (which was a wonderful side with the chicken), lastly, I had steamed broccoli on the side. Thanks for sharing, this one&#039;s a keeper!"
128473,83203,2014-02-16,4,"This is a lovely recipe, we did enjoyed the chicken.  I used bone and skin on thighs. Unfortunately the temperature was too high and our chicken burned. It still tasted good and had nice texture, but there was no sauce to speak of....and we peeled off the burnt skin.  I love all the ingredients in the sauce and will make this again, but at a much lower temperature.  Thanks for sharing your recipe. Made for Best of 2013."
632249,83203,2014-06-08,4,"Great flavour, simple preparation.  I let the chicken marinate for 3 hours. Reduced the heat to 350F and it was done in the same amount of  time. I used a dark sesame oil which is very strong so I put in about 2 tsps of that and made up the rest with canola oil.  Even though I used low sodium soy sauce, I still found it very salty, so may reduce that or add a bit of water next time.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will be sure to use again."
894666,83203,2016-03-14,5,"Used a couple lbs of boneless skinless breasts cut into strips, marinated it all for 3 hours before baking 45 mins at 350, flipping halfway through. Used only 1 T of sesame oil which was plenty, also used fresh ginger.. After cooking chicken, poured the liquids in a saucepan with cornstarch/water mix and cooked to thicken up. Served chicken over rice with side of asparagus and sauce over the whole thing with spicy chinese mustard on the side. Was delicious, can&#039;t imagine it would be as good if it wasn&#039;t marinated or if the sauce wasn&#039;t cooked though. Will make again!"
1072593,71557,2009-03-08,5,I don't think a chicken's thigh ever tasted so delicious!
60992,71557,2005-01-07,5,"Fantastic! Again, simple is sometimes the best. This is a fast, quick recipe with quality ingredients. A great weeknight dinner, it tastes like you fussed forever and it's done in less than 30 minutes! I served it with oven browned potatoes and italian green beans. This will be repeated often in our family. Thanks for sharing!"
182624,71557,2005-01-11,5,"These were fantastic.  I was pretty shocked, to be honest!  While I was cooking this up, all I kept thinking was ""balsamic and shallots...that's it?  Really?""  But I was very pleasantly surprised with the very first bite.  The balsamic adds so much flavor but isn't overpowering at all, and the shallots add just the perfect amount of texture and flavor.  It's also quite possibly the easiest dish to make on the planet.  This is one that I wish I could give 10 stars!  I'm now going to check out your other recipes to see what other goodies you've got hiding, mickie.  THANKS!"
47559,71557,2005-05-17,5,Fast and easy (and economical) weeknight food that tastes better than that.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was great.  What more can you ask for?  I served it over rice.
64642,71557,2005-07-04,3,A very easy to assemble dish with nice flavor.
97579,71557,2005-07-20,4,"This was very good.  I didn't have shallots, so I used onions.  I made Perfect Rice Everytime #53520 as a side and it was a very good dinner.  I will definately be making again.  Thanks!
"
189616,71557,2005-08-03,5,"Great just great, just shows the simpliest ingredients could provide one of the tastiest meals
Thank You mickie49!"
46660,71557,2005-08-12,5,"I was very impressed with this chicken.  It was so easy to make with such nice flavor!  My kids loved it too!  The only thing I did differently was to brown it in a little peanut oil, and then drained it before covering.  Thanks for a recipe I'll be adding to my regular cookbook!"
13483,71557,2005-12-11,5,Sorry.  I forgot the star button.  Obviously this is a 5 star in my opinion.
39301,71557,2006-07-12,5,Very simple and very flavorful!  Who could ask for more? Thanks for sharing this.  We'll make it often - simple and delicious!
4470,71557,2006-07-22,0,"    Made this for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first !
     Easy, simple and simply delicious chicken dish - not only that ,look at the calories and fat content.. This took minutes to prepare and will be enjoyed again in the futurer.  I recently bought a good quality (not truly aged but better than th low end)  Balsamic vinegar and it is worth the extra cost. This chicken had a warm, peppy flavor. Served with whole wheat noodles, celeric/onion & steamed cabbage.  Wonderful meal.
Thanks mickie49 - this recipe is for everyday fare or company dinner times"
222055,71557,2006-07-26,5,Absolutely loved it and it is a DEFINITE Keeper!!!
49304,71557,2006-08-17,5,"Update: I just recently made this recipe again for guest doubling the recipe. Everyone loved these tasty chicken thighs.
Thanks again for the recipe."
91392,71557,2006-09-13,5,"This was surprisingly good.  I had only green onions, so I used those.  Will add this to my quick and seriously good and cheap repertoire.  You could serve this to company, it is that good.  I think it needs dark meat though, breasts wouldn't be as nice."
207176,71557,2006-10-30,4,I would give this a 5 but my kids thought the balsamic taste was too potent.  I did add some garlic and honey and I used onion instead of shallots.  Thanks for posting and I'll make it again for the adults in my world!
318235,71557,2007-01-22,4,"Very easy, but still filling and delicious."
357358,71557,2007-05-29,4,Nice flavor and easy to make. All I could have wished for was the sauce flavor to permeate the chicken more. Made for DH & I but my son and his wife showed up for dinner unexpectedly. They ate 2 thighs each which is amazing since he prefers steak and she is from the Dominican Republic and a bit hesitant about trying unfamiliar cuisine. I had to use a vidalia onion since shallots aren't available here. Next time I will saute the onion separately to keep its sweetness and add to the sauce just before serving. Thanks for sharing.
231054,71557,2007-09-23,5,"Oh, yes, yes, YES!  Whenever I see a recipe such as this with balsamic vinegar, I'm all ears.  I love how it cooks up into this amazingly rich glaze.  I used skinless and boneless chicken thighs (it's what I had).  Obviously they cooked up in less time than the 25 minutes.  Next time, I will try the bone-in skinless thighs.  But these were so delicious.  My husband won't touch ""dark"" meat -- so I fixed him something else -- and had the thighs all to myself.  If you are a fan of balsamic vinegar (used similar to the same way it's used in this recipe) check out my Salmon with Balsamic (#144318) and my Rosemary Chicken (#176427).  Thank you, Mickie for this outstanding recipe."
373817,71557,2007-11-19,5,This was so good! I'm putting this in my favorites cookbook! Thanks!
185926,71557,2008-06-03,5,"Simple, easy, fast and tastes great.  My husband and son loved it.  They're taking it for lunch tomorrow.  Thank you for a great recipe."
199792,71557,2008-08-19,5,"Delicious. After my sons first taste he proclaimed this to be 10 points! The aroma when you add in the balsamic vinegar is amazing and then you only have to wait a few minutes to eat them. I used boneless, skinless thighs which worked fine. Easy recipe and very good. This will be made here many times. Thanks for sharing this great little recipe."
229850,71557,2008-11-17,4,"These were good, but I would have liked a little more glaze, but then wonder if it would be overpowering."
269331,71557,2008-11-23,5,OMG... This was sooo good!  I used bone-in skin-on chicken thighs that I browned in olive oil and butter.  The final dish was served this over white rice.  Thank you for posting this delicious recipe.
60989,71557,2008-11-24,5,Too easy and too good! The flavor with so few ingredients is amazing. Thanks!
74281,71557,2010-03-23,5,"Very simple and very delicous. Even the ""vinegar haters"" in my house loved this dish. The only thing I did differently was to double the balsamic and simmer with the lid opened for about 10 minutes so I would have a lot of sauce that had reduced a bit."
92816,71557,2010-03-28,3,"This was ok.I used drumsticks instead of thighs but I found the balsamic to be too overpowering.If I make this again,I would give it a more of a sweet and sour taste by adding brown sugar to the balsamic."
140132,71557,2010-11-05,4,"This is such an easy recipe.  I made this for my family and we enjoyed it very much.  I loved the sauce the vinegar makes, adds the right amount of zing to the chicken.  I did add some poultry seasoning to the salt and pepper before cooking otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Thank you for sharing, this is good and I will make again."
126440,71557,2013-05-18,5,Only made two and wish I would have made more as it is so good.  Served with Creamy  Italian Orzo (153994)  Will make these all the time.
1052873,71557,2013-06-06,2,"Sorry, this didn&#039;t turn out well. Maybe there are different kinds of balsamic vinegar. It was way too strong."
218535,71557,2017-06-17,4,Not bad but not our favorite
55729,63860,2003-08-30,5,"This recipe is just perfect! I can see myself making this every day - the mug will make it portable for those frazzled mornings. I'm looking forward to adding bacon and cheese next time (haven't been to the store yet). I like that I can put it in the microwave and go do something else, instead of having to watch it like an egg cooked on the stove. Thank you!"
50969,63860,2003-09-10,5," my b/f had to work late one night and i was looking for something quick,so i tried this it was so good. i used some leftover ham that i had.about half way through the cooking time i put the ham in.
i will fix this again!!!"
37868,63860,2003-10-25,5,I must give this a 5 star. My husband has not been eating very well. I had to make it fast. Well he did not see me at the stove and I just put it in front of him. I have you know he ate every bite of it. Served it with bacon bits and cheese and a slice of toast. Thank You.
95743,63860,2003-12-04,5,"Well, the power is out again, but I do have a generator, a microwave and an appetite.  Had this with some green onion added to the raw eggs and some tangy goat cheese melted into the cooked eggs. And no mess or load of dirty dishes to clean up with no hot water. Now THIS is roughing it. Thanks, Ridgely!"
74652,63860,2004-01-27,5,"My mother always made this for me as a child and I still love it! To save even more time and calories I now spray the mug with buttered flavored PamYou can add different items to taste.  Its like and omelette in a mug!  Thanks for posting a great recipe!
"
59780,63860,2004-01-29,5,Simple and Fast! I made this for breakfast it was great! I sprayed the mug with non stick spray and omitted the bacon. Will be using this again soon. Thanks!
101823,63860,2004-02-05,4,"I had a few extra minutes this morning and decided to add a little something to my usual breakfast of whole grain toast and peanut butter.  This recipe has been in my cookbook for some time, and I am glad that I finally tried it.  I used real butter, skim milk, only 1 egg, sharp cheddar cheese and no bacon (didn't have any that was cooked...and didn't have time to deal with it).  This was a very quick and easy way to get the fluffy scrambled eggs that I love.  It was a major bonus not to have to take the time to stand at the stove and stir, stir, stir.  I could toss the mug in the microwave and continue putting together my lunch.  Great quick meal for busy mornings!"
40961,63860,2004-02-27,5,Thanks for posting this 5 star recipe. It was easy to prepare and delicious to eat. What a great idea. Fluffy and tasty.
35526,63860,2004-03-07,5,The perfect zaar breakfast!!!The eggs turned out fluffy and moist.  Love it and will be making it often!
43083,63860,2004-08-10,5,And to think I thought I was so clever when I tried this a few yrs ago when I was too lazy to cook some eggs on the stove for my now ex-bf...haha..of course all I did was put two eggs in the microwave with nothing added! Tried your recipe today and followed exactly except no bacon. Fabulous is the word! Very creamy:) Thanks!
176615,63860,2004-12-07,5,"Amazing! I will never make eggs in a skillet again! Very fluffy and couldn't be easier. Really convenient when only one or two people are having eggs, or when breakfast is prpared at different times. I used a pyrex measuring cup and ate it right out of that..no clean up! The recipe as stated with bacon and cheese is wonderful. I've also tried it with onion, green pepper, tomato, one cut up corn tortilla, topped with salsa and cheese for a migas taste. Also with onion, green pepper, tomato and cream cheese. Yummy all the way around. Thanks Ridgely for a great recipe that I'll use often!"
149363,63860,2005-04-08,5,"Awesome!! I made this exactly as suggested, and added shredded cheese on top, it was FANTASTIC! My DD just likes her eggs plain, so I did one egg by itself with nothing added except the butter, cooked for 1 min. and she had a great breakfast before School.
Quick and Easy, thanks for a winner!"
119466,63860,2005-08-30,4,"I have made eggs this way many times since seeing this recipe, but just realized I have never reviewed it. Such a handy way to cook breakfast for one. I have started skipping the butter and just spraying a mug with cooking spray and that works fine. Thanks for posting this quick, handy way of cooking eggs!"
36944,63860,2005-09-30,5,"Brilliant method for fixing delicious creamy eggs that are literally ready to eat start to finish in about 3 minutes.  I used one egg and cooked on high 20 seconds, stirred with a fork, cooked 20 seconds longer.  Threw in a bit of cheddar cheese stirred once more.  Let it sit a minute or so while I put jelly on my toast.  I love the fact it was in a mug because it kept the egg hot and I detest cold eggs. Thank you so much for a great recipe Ridgely! "
98919,63860,2005-10-04,5,"Eggs in the microwave are nice and fluffy.  I've done a lo-cal version, by using a cooking spray (easier clean up)...water or skim milk...(no butter)and my favorite seasonings. (California-style onion powder a must!!)  Still makes for great eggs. I love the convenience and no mess! "
188119,63860,2006-02-07,5,"Hrm, interesting.. I used egg substitute and it came out pretty good.  Thanks"
189616,63860,2006-03-05,5,"For almost a week now we have had a combination of either frozen drains or frozen pipes, so cooking has been quite a challenge. We have hot water now, but the only drain that is working is the bathroom! So I have been making alot of foil dinners, or crockpot with the disposable liner, and going through ALOT of paper plates, and other disposable products. This recipe was PERFECT! It allowed me to make my family a 'real' breakfast and  not add to my pile of dirty dishes! Paper coffee cups worked great with this.
Thank You Ridgely!"
316717,63860,2007-04-27,5,wow this is really neat. i came out w/ very soft and fluffy eggs. i did 2 eggs and microwaved it for 1 min and 30 secs. didn't add any bacon because i was feeling lazy to cook some. thanks for sharing such a cool recipe! =)
13483,63860,2007-06-16,5,"Served this over toast with a veggie and a salad and called it dinner.  I just love fast, simple and good food.  This filled the bill.  Nice to know a good meal is just minutes away.  Thanks Ridgely"
400708,63860,2008-09-20,4,"This was so much fun and so easy, there's no reason not to have breakfast anytime.  Can't wait for DGSs to come and visit so I can teach it to them.  I added fresh salsa and mozzerella cheese to the top and it was great.  Served with hot coffe and toasted bagels - YUM!!  Thanks Ridgely for a really nice recipe."
373817,63860,2009-04-23,5,My 4 year old loved helping me make these! I loved that they were so fast to make and tasted delicious! Great recipe!!
359220,63860,2009-05-27,5,"I can't believe I forgot to rate this!  In my quest for healthier eating, I wanted to incorporate some protein-rich eggs, but I have NO time to stand over the stove in the morning.  I place one egg in a small plastic tupperware, add a touch of milk, salt and pepper and scramble the night before.  Then, at work the next morning, I zap it in the microwave and top with ketchup (yum!)....I've eaten it every morning for the past 3 weeks- and this from a person who doesn't normally like eggs!"
369715,63860,2009-09-10,5,Made this for breakfast at work. This was easy to make. I followed the recipe as written using milk. I did add some bacon bits and cheese. Yummy easy breakfast. Made for Fall PAC 2009.
579298,63860,2009-11-11,5,Super easy and super fun! Thank you for posting the perfect lazy Sunday morning recipe :)
298447,63860,2010-06-27,5,"This recipe proves that you really do have time to make breakfast every morning!  When it tastes this good and is fast, easy to make with virtually no clean up afterwards....well...what's not to love?!  Great way to use up leftovers lurking in your fridge--just chop it up and add it in. My kids really enjoy preparing this, especially since they can personalize their breakfast.  It almost helps guarantee that they will eat it all!  Thank you!"
362983,63860,2014-03-27,5,These are probably the easiest and fastest &#039;scrambled&#039; eggs I&#039;ve ever made! I made 2 eggs and they were PERFECT after 75 seconds. Didn&#039;t even add any bacon or cheese because it was just so good already. Thanks so much; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be making them any other way now!
42720,108248,2005-01-16,5,"I am so glad you posted this recipe! I too, was amazed that this recipe wasn't already posted on Zaar because I searched for it during the Christmas holidays. This is Nestle's Original Toll House recipe for cookies/bar cookies.  You can find it on the back of every package of Nestle' Toll House Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels, BUT if you are like me, always looking for ways to cut costs, you don't always buy the name brand products. Such was my dilemma when I had bought an off-brand bag of chocolate morsels and wanted to make this recipe! IMO, this is the best ""tried & true""  recipe I have ever made for chocolate chip cookies or the bar version. I have also used this recipe to make the ""giant"" chocolate chip cookie which is baked in a 12"" pizza pan for 20 minutes.  Cool and decorate with icing for birthdays or other occasions.  Again, thanks for posting this great recipe. It is going into my Zaar cookbook where I'll always be able to find it! :)
"
38643,108248,2005-01-23,5,DH and I made these yesterday during the blizzard of 2005 and I have to tell you they were awesome. I made them in a 13x9 pan as I didn't have a bigger one and they turned out perfect. Serve them warm..you won't be sorry!
89831,108248,2005-03-20,5,"Wonderful NPG!... 5 star plus! I think these bars are even better than cookies! Very simple to make, and so chewy and delicious. I baked this in a 13x9 inch pan for 30 minutes. Cut them into small squares and served them at my get together. Everyone really enjoyed these. This is definately a repeater. Thanks so much for sharing, ....Kittencal:)"
92816,108248,2005-09-02,5,These are delicious!!I underbaked mine by about 5 minutes.It gives the brownie a very nice fudgy center.I will definately be making these again.
173579,108248,2005-11-01,5,This is a great recipe.  So quick and easy.  My DH loves chocolate chip cookies.  He was very pleased with this recipe.  Thanks for posting.
222433,108248,2006-01-05,5,"So good! My jelly roll pan was a little larger so they came out not as thick, but still wonderful. I baked them about 20 min but watched them carefully so they would not be overdone. Thanks Newspapergal!"
32058,108248,2006-01-07,5,"Had to rerate this one!  I tried it again, I knew It had to be me andused the CORRECT sizzed pan.  I baked it less than 20 minutes and they are DELISH! Will make again!"
29782,108248,2006-01-16,5,"This was so so good!!! I lefted out the nuts but it sure didn't hurt a thing for us. Have the pan is gone already!  I love the thickness too. Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream too!
Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Its a must from now on! "
177933,108248,2006-01-20,5,"Great!  I noticed as I was pouring in the chips that the recipe is the same as for the cookies.  Wow, doing it this way made it so much easier than having to keep making cookies.  Thanks!!"
199020,108248,2006-02-05,4,I have to say I prefer the cookies to the bars.  It is the exact same recipe; the only difference is the directions.  Thanks for sharing.
125640,108248,2006-04-07,5,"Easy and yummy. I did make a couple of changes though. I subbed wheat flour for 1/4 cup of the flour and splenda and brown sugar twin for 1/3 of the sugars for diet reasons, as well as only using bewtween 1/2 and 3/4 of the chocolate  chips (I used bitter-sweet) because I thought the whole bag would make this too sweet for me. Glad I did; it was just short of too much for me. I can definately see how people would have a hard time spreading the batter as directed, there would about be more chocolate than cookie dough. I did use pecans which were an excellent choice, though I may try walnuts next time. And I also took another reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and like many other reviewers used a 9""x13"" pan because it was what I had. Thanks."
55729,108248,2006-06-03,3,"I am sure it's just me, but I didn't like these as much as I thought I would. Something in the balance of flavors seemed to be off."
173314,108248,2006-09-04,5,did as directed except no nuts.  Delicious and will be great lunch snack for back to school. THANK YOU!
278113,108248,2007-07-13,5,My kids love these..they have become a regular in our home..thanks for sharing!
368078,108248,2007-08-23,5,This recipe was WONDERFUL.  I made just as posted except that I halved the recipe and baked in an 8X8 baking dish - and it turned out perfect!  I know this will be one I make again and again!  Thanks newspapergal!
47907,108248,2007-09-25,5,I've been making this recipe for forever it seems and it's a great one.  Super easy to make and takes so much less time than making chocolate chips the traditional way.  My whole family loves it and I'm so glad to see it here on Zaar.  Thanks for posting a keeper!
189616,108248,2008-01-11,5,"I'm so glad this recipe was posted! I had lost mine and I didn't have enough time to make the drop cookie version. The batter is extremly thick to spread, so I used a plastic sandwhich back to help spread it into the pan."
218535,108248,2008-02-06,5,This is wonderfully delicious. I baked mine for 20 mins and the center is soft and chewy.
789516,108248,2008-04-20,5,"I used a combo of chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips.  Next time I would use a smaller cookie sheet, the one recommended is a bit big for the recipe stated."
55578,108248,2009-02-19,5,"Excellent!  Made as written.  It's so much easier than making cookies, and a lot quicker!"
158086,108248,2009-04-20,5,"These were perfect, chewy and rich....will have to make these again for our euchre BBQ.....a must try..."
632249,108248,2009-07-09,3,These were okay but none of us loved them. I thought they were a bit dry.  Maybe I should have put in the optional nuts for some oomph! Thx.
359220,108248,2009-10-11,4,What a nice blast from the past!  Made a pan of these treats for DH's lunches this week and was very pleased how quickly the pan was in the oven baking away!  I almost always have the ingredients on hand- an extra plus!  Rated down on star because it took me a good extra 10 minutes to get the center baked completely through.  Will turn to these again!  Thanks!
121185,108248,2009-11-10,2,"Hmmmm....We were not overly impressed by these.  In fact, my kids, after having one, have passed up my offers for another square.  They were very greasy and not incredibly moist (how is that possible?)."
1133190,108248,2010-01-09,4,This is a good basic recipe but I have tried other bars I like better.
329638,108248,2010-03-19,5,"Freakin YUM.  And sooo easy.  I mixed it up, used half a package of chocolate chips and 1 cup of m&m's, plopped it all into my 9"" glass pie plate and baked for about 23 minutes, or until the top and sides were golden brown but the middle was still slightly underbaked.  We let it cool about an hour, which was quite a feat of willpower.  Talk abotu perfect...it was exactly how we love our cookies..firm edges and fudgy, just slightly underbaked centers.  This was soooo good and so easy.  I'm making more tonight!  Thanks for posting."
91392,108248,2011-06-06,0,"Good bar cookie, nothing like the flat cookie version in my opinion.  Be careful not to overcook, probably better to slightly undercook."
191533,108248,2013-04-06,5,Delicious! Definitely the best if you take them out of the oven while still a little jiggly; (browned top). They cool to a firm but chewy bar- not crisp.
1179225,108248,2014-01-25,5,A delicious classic!
42720,29598,2003-04-06,5,"Mark, I have to admit to ignorance, but I am not sure what coarse grain mustard is so I used regular ole French's mustard.  Other than that, followed your ingredient list exactly and blended it all together in my blender because I was too lazy to mince the garlic.  This made plenty of marinade for 10 thighs which we grilled outdoors after about 6 hrs. marinating time.  You are right!  This is a wonderful marinade for chicken.  I left the skin on the thighs for grilling because I believe it helps keep the meat moist. The combination of this marinade and grilling gives the chicken a finger-lickin' good flavor!  We will be using this recipe often.
   "
9869,2886,2001-09-17,5,The smell of this when its in the oven!....wow....this is delish!!  =)
59473,29598,2004-05-31,5,This was really good. I used boneless chicken breasts and marinated them for 8 hours. We cooked them on the barbecue and they turned out so moist. Thanks
64203,29598,2004-07-09,5,"I love recipes like this! Even though the list of ingredients is long, they are all simple and things you already have on hand. This has a wonderful flavor... great for chicken breasts in salad as well!"
92816,29598,2004-07-25,5,"I made a few revisions to this recipe.I did not have all the ingredients on hand.So,I used regular vinegar,regular mustard and did not use any lime juice.This marinade made for a wonderful golden brown chicken and very moist.The flavor went through the chicken beautifully."
89831,29598,2005-07-21,5,"GinnyP, I just couldn't wait to rate this wonderful marinade recipe! I used this marinade for chicken breasts, marinated them early in the morning and grilled them today. I added about 1 heaping tablespoon of minced fresh garlic in with the marinade, and increased the mustard slightly. The chicken breasts were so tender, and without an overpowering taste, just perfect flavor!! I'll use this again...Kittencal:)"
53932,29598,2005-07-23,4,"This produced very moist chicken, but was a bit too sweet for me.  I thought the acids would balance the sweetness but not so.  Next time, I would just add 1/4 of the sugar and add more garlic."
222564,29598,2005-10-29,4,"Great recipe for grilling skinles chicken bits! Did no one else find it a little dry? Must have been the chicken. Will try again, the marinade was so good."
329638,29598,2006-08-29,5,"I tried this last night- so yummy!  I made a few changes (due to ingredients on hand and lack thereof).  I only had 3 chicken breasts, so halved the recipe.  I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic, only 3 Tablespoons of brown sugar, 1/4 c lemon juice and 1/2 c margarita mix, and balsamic vinegar instead of cider.
My husband raved over the chicken (and he doesn't like mustard!), and we will be adding this to our regular rotation of recipes.  Very yummy!"
13483,29598,2006-09-05,5,"Not too much I can add to what has already been said!!!  I cut this back to a two portions size and let it ""stew"" in the marinate for the day.  Very much enjoyed.....and very simple to do as well.  Thanks GinnyP"
140132,29598,2007-01-26,5,"We loved this very versitile recipe.  I was craving a summer style meal and made this was chicken breasts, potato salad and beans....yummy.  Thank you for my little taste of summer in the winter.....Stephanie"
359220,29598,2007-02-01,5,"WOW!  I had a package of boneless, skinless chicken thighs waiting for DH and I at home.  Thought to myself...why not add some marinade (I never have time).  Followed the recipe except for the lime juice (didn't have any) and marinated for 3 hours.  After I sauteed the chicken breasts, I couldn't believe how yummy this recipe came out...the vinegar/brown sugar combination kind of carmelized on the thighs and DH wouldn't stop commenting on how good they were.  Sold!"
111291,29598,2007-02-27,5,"Found this recipe last summer and realized as I made it for the ""millionth"" time tonight that I had never rated it.  I usually make it on the outdoor grill, but because of a snow packed patio, used the Foreman grill.  Awesome on that too. Absolutely one of my favorite chicken recipes.  I know it's been said 78 times before, but it's true: this recipe is  AMAZING!"
447123,29598,2007-03-28,5,Heaven........... I am in heaven. WOW this is really really great. I mean it!!! I didn't have 24 hours to marinate it so I marinated for 4 hours. REally yummy. Eveyone loved them. A few things I added that really threw it over the top................ I cooked up some bacon and after the chicken was cooked put 2 or 3 pieces of bacon on each breast. THen I sprinkled cheddar on top. Put it under the broiler for just a few minutes until the cheese melted. (be careful not to over cook) Tasted better than a resturaunt!!! GOT TO TRY THIS!!! Your family will love you forever!! Thanks GinnyP
103876,29598,2007-04-02,5,"This is the best chicken marinade!  Every time I make it, I get compliments because the flavors are very distinct and the meat is perfectly juicy and tender.  Definitely a favorite!"
64583,29598,2007-06-28,5,Yeah!  I found another great marinade recipe for my collection.  How did it take me so long to find this recipe!  This is truly delicious.  Not too sweet like I was afraid from 1/2 cup brown sugar ....in fact all of the ingredients work so well together that not one in particular stands out as the strongest flavor.  Just wonderfully tasty!  This also wins extra points for not being a salty marinade as so many store bought ones are.  Thanks for posting!
377581,29598,2007-07-25,4,Wonderful marinade; easy and very flavorful! Thank you for a great recipe. I'll be making this again.
355637,29598,2007-08-03,4,"What a strange - yet tasty marinade! My husband was watching me last night as I was throwing this concoction together and I almost wonder if he was worried - especially when he saw the mustard going in! I used regular mustard, as it was what I had on hand. Nice, flavorful marinade."
158086,29598,2007-08-12,5,This was very good marinade...the chicken stayed nice and moist...though I do think I like my tarragon marinade a little more...
125640,29598,2008-01-28,5,"I cooked this in the George Foreman grill. I used garlic powder and subbed tangerine juice for 1 tsp of the lime juice 'cause I'm not that big on lime. Very easy to make yet very tasty. It tasted like a sweet teryaki at first and then you got a burst of citrus. Thanks for sharing. Will definately make it again.
Update: We tried this broiled instead of grilled tonight. The flavor was very different - the mustard flavor was more pronounced, and no similarity to teriyaki. Family preferred grilled 2 to 1, but both ways were very good and DH thought the way it came out tonight was among the best chicken I've ever made. Thanks again."
222433,29598,2008-04-11,4,I thought that the whole grain mustard was fantastic in there. Really nice flavor. We grilled our chicken breasts and they came out nice and juicy.
499050,29598,2008-06-01,5,Yum.
316717,29598,2008-07-05,5,this was a hit w/ the kids. dh really liked it too. will definately make this again.
333017,29598,2009-04-05,5,"Perfect marinade for OMAC.  I did cut down on the brown sugar to 3T and that was plenty sweet for us.  Once a month, I get boneless chicken thighs from Costco and choose 3 different types of marinade.  We loved this marinade and it has now become a family favorite.  Definately will go in the regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing, GInny"
847160,29598,2009-04-27,2,that wasnt really good for us .. to sweet plus its not a good mix of flavor
426903,29598,2009-06-24,5,Very tasty and flavorful chicken!
579298,29598,2009-07-17,5,Great indeed! We all loved it! Thanks for posting :D
637486,29598,2009-12-03,4,"This was pretty good....I have to admit that I didn't have either the lime or lemon juice, so I'm sure that it would have been very different with those added, but either way, we did enjoy it."
52262,29598,2009-12-22,5,"Good and easy with all ingredients in the house to start.  Had a lot of marinade left over when I made 3 large chicken breasts, 2 thighs, and 3 drumsticks."
808027,29598,2010-03-25,5,"This is amazing and produced very juicy, flavorful chicken.  I can see why there are so many positive reviews...just perfect for grilled chicken.  I didn't tell my mustard-hating husband there was mustard in the marinade and he scarfed it up and said how great it was.  :-)  Sometimes a girl's just gotta do what a girl's gotta do...this is immediately going into my keeper file."
1122161,29598,2010-07-01,5,Really good! This is how I made mine...First I marinated as directed for about 8 hours. I grilled on the Forman grill for about 6 min. While that was grilling I boiled the marinade and dipped  chicken in that once done. Then I spooned a couple Tbsp over chicken. Really great recipe! Thanks for posting this!
362983,29598,2010-08-04,5,"I'll see this recipe pop up constantly but never got around to using it; so I was SUPER excited when I finally had the time to try this, and let me tell you, this was just SO delicious. I had skinless chicken thighs (bone in) and marinated them for over 24 hours, and the chicken ended up so moist and full of flavour! And the sauce was to die for! I think next time, I'd reserve the marinade after putting the chicken in the oven, then cook it on the stove top to help reduce it a bit more and get a nice, thicker consistency. Also I think the only other minor thing I'd do next time is to maybe reduce the brown sugar just a tad, but other than that, this was perfect! Thank you!"
1072593,29598,2010-12-10,5,"Amazing Chicken Marinade...so, this is what my life's been missing!  Made for P-A-R-T-Y tag."
470351,29598,2011-07-19,5,Absolutely excellent!  I follow the recipe as stated and used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I only marinated 2 hours and still was most excellent!  Will definitely make this again.
937635,29598,2011-07-21,5,Loved it! Used garlic powder and poured it into a gallon bag with 2 leg quarters and 2 skinless breasts. Yummo!
173314,29598,2011-11-08,5,We really enjoyed this.  Was worried at first as I thought cider vinegar stronger than normal white vinegar.  I used yellow mustard and garlic powder in place of cloves.  Was Delicious and will use often. Thanks.
789516,29598,2012-05-20,5,"Delicious!  I halved the recipe for 2 chicken breasts.. I didn't have a fresh lemon and lime, but I used 3 tbsp bottled lemon juice (for half the recipe) and it was perfect.  I marinaded it for about 3 hours, part of the time the breasts were still partially frozen.. worked great but next time I'll try to do it the night before!"
33159,29598,2013-02-10,4,"This was good, just found that the flavour was fairly mild even after marinating overnight."
191533,29598,2013-05-20,3,"Good, not extraordinary. I didn&#039;t think the long marinating made much difference. Served with bbq sauce, and used leftover chicken in a salad."
368078,29598,2015-04-11,5,"Excellent!  Made just as directed, however we only marinaded for three hours.  We also grilled on a lower heat, which resulted in nice moist chicken, and an excellent glaze on the outside.  Will definitely make again often!"
32772,2886,2003-04-08,5,This recipe has been a family favorite for a long time. I make mini-loaves so I can freeze some. When making the smaller loaves you don't have to cook them as long. This recipe doubles well also.
188119,2886,2005-05-12,5,"sooooooo good!
I think next time I will add halved pecans on the top and maybe some chopped ones inside.
This was reallly delicious =)
Thanks!"
29014,2886,2006-03-06,5,"Ok - this recipe doesn't need another review, but my husband is forever asking me to buy bananas, and then letting them go brown, so I NEEDED this recipe!  Easy, moist and delicious, and I don't even LIKE bananas!  The only change I made was to add a half-cup of applesauce because I only had three bananas.  Thanks for a keeper!"
172369,2886,2007-03-23,5,"I have tried several Banana bread recipes and you are right, this is the best! Thanks for sharing a great easy recipe. Melody"
60989,2886,2007-04-09,5,"Very good bread. Nice and dense, the way we like it. Thanks!"
394077,2886,2007-08-06,5,"My goodness, this bread is good. Moist, flavorful and soft. Wow, is all I can say. I made muffins out of these and it took 35 minutes. Thank you for sharing your recipe."
135887,2886,2007-09-14,4,Very good and simple to make.  DS loved it!
126104,2886,2007-11-02,5,"This sure doesn't need another review, but it's getting one any way.

This was absolutely delicious.  I did add a can of blueberries, because I had them.  I doubt that made much difference.  It's a really ""banana"" flavor.  I took the hint from another poster, and let it sit on the counter (in the pan and before I put it in the pan) for about 20 min.

I think this would work nicely in muffins, and just check them a while before the hour is up.  An absolute keeper.

I forgot to time it, and I believe I took it out early, because after cutting a few slices (hot from the oven), the center was oozing.  I hope I don't forget to get the remainder out before it's burned, but at least I got two slices."
218535,2886,2007-12-16,3,Tried this recipe but was disappointed. Not as flavorful or as moist as Sour Cream Banana Bread (Recipe #9351).
140806,2886,2007-12-31,5,"I should have waited a little longer before cutting into the loaf, because it was still kinda mushy. Next day it had set up really well and was delicious topped with crunchy peanut butter. I might reduce the banana ever so slightly next time, maybe to 3 1/2. Great recipe. I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor."
207176,2886,2008-05-28,5,"YUM! I used 3, very ripe, bananas and wound up adding extra sugar by accident.  It didn't matter because it was lovely.  I am sharing it with my son and his tutor and we are having it warm!  No time to wait!  Thanks!"
937635,2886,2008-08-28,5,"THE BEST EVER!!! I was so impressed with this recipe. To die for! I always add chocolate chips to my banana breads, too, but this one could even stand alone. THANK YOU!"
847160,2886,2008-10-08,4,good
64583,2886,2008-10-18,5,"My house smells so good right now!!  I made 6 batches of this wonderful banana bread so I now have: 3 full size loaves, 4 mini-loaves, 1 bundt cake and 18 muffins.   I found 2 bags of overripe bananas at the store for only 99 cents, so I used them all up this evening with this recipe.  This is the perfect banana bread recipe - great banana taste, very moist and not spongy like some other banana breads that I've tried.   I covered the full sized loaves with aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes of bake time so that the tops wouldn't be too browned.  I also substituted butter flavored Crisco for the butter because I found I didn't have any butter on hand.  This is now the only recipe I'll use."
189475,2886,2009-01-26,5,"Perfect! It was so easy to make and it was delicious. I didn't crush the bananas first. I just squeezed them while they were still in the peel to soften them up, then I added them to the bowl and used the electric mixer. I will definitely be making this again. It's a great way to get rid of the bananas that are about to go bad. Thanks for the recipe!"
383346,2886,2010-12-07,5,This is one of the best banana bread I made.  It's very moist and the taste is amazing.  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar.  I baked it 20 minutes more.  Thanks ikadlec :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
1052873,2886,2011-02-09,5,"This was so easy! Good, too. Kids like this better than banana banana bread, which is my favorite. Used 2 frozen, 2 overripe and microwaved to make them really mushy. Should have floured the pan in addition to the Pam."
482376,2886,2011-04-12,4,I loved how high this banana bread rose. It was very moist and the banana flavor was nice and strong. I would probably eliminate one banana next time so the bread wouldn't be as moist. I like mine a little bit drier (personal preference). Thanks!
203111,2886,2011-05-14,5,"Oh my goodness, this may be the best banana bread I've ever made or eaten!  I did use 1/4 cup applesauce in place of half the butter and I used half white and half brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I baked it in two aluminum bread pans for 50 min.  I let them rest for 10 min. after removing them from the oven, then got them out of the pans and cooled on a rack.  I then ate half a loaf and am thinking about going back for more.  It is SO Good!!!!"
8688,2886,2012-11-03,5,I have to agree with the other 439 reviewers - This is the Perfect Banana Bread.  Not too sweet with the proper balance of banana to flour to make the best texture.  I did add 1 cup of well chopped walnuts to this recipe.  This recipe is truly exceptional!
368078,2886,2015-01-07,5,"Made just as directed, and it was amazing.  Definitely will be my go-to banana bread now!"
298447,2886,2014-11-09,5,Love it...added finely chopped walnuts...loved it even more.  Thank you!
98919,2886,2015-05-04,5,I just wanted a quick and easy banana recipe and this one was perfect! I threw it together in no time and it turned out delicious. I added largely chopped pecans. Will be a favorite from now on. Thanks for posting.
1581225,2886,2016-11-09,5,"This is a great banana bread, this is now replacing my previous go-to recipe! This one uses white sugar instead of brown which my other one does, I like the 'lighter' flavour of this."
489552,2886,2017-06-18,0,Always always comes out perfect!! My family can't get enough. I have to make 2 loafs. I always use frozen (defrosted ahead of time of course) bananas. :)
42094,15072,2002-05-27,5,"My husband, who considers himself a brownie connoisseur, loves these and thinks they are truly perfect. I agree. Easy to make and oh so wonderful. A definite crowd-pleaser."
18391,15072,2002-11-22,5,These are the best chocolate brownies ever!! I didn't add the nuts as my husband is allergic to them .. next time I will add chocolate chips! Thanks!!
8688,15072,2003-05-07,5,"I have made a lot of brownie recipes, and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest!  So very simple to prepare, using Virginia's excellent instructions.  Even mixing the batter by wooden spoon is simple because you are adding in only portions at a time.  I omitted the nuts as I will be offering these to my son who doesn't like nuts in his brownies (I love them and would have added walnuts - next batch, I will!).  Brownies were ready and baked in exactly 30 minutes.  I will keep this recipe in my Make Again Collection!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us, Virginia!"
55578,15072,2003-08-16,5,"I wanted to see what all the fuss was about these brownies, and now I know, they are fantastic!"
64583,15072,2003-09-15,5,I can't say anything that hasn't been said already!  These ARE the BEST brownies!
89831,15072,2004-01-19,5,"Hi Virginia...I made your brownies today, after reading all the great reviews, I just had to see what all this fuss was about, and now i know...well, what more can I add that has not already been said...these are actually the best brownies that I have ever made...this is what a brownie should taste like...moist, soft, and with a rich chocolate flavor...made them exactly as stated... I added 1 cup chocolate chips, and 2 Tbsp Kahlua (that I had left over from Christmas, with the vanilla)... baked it on the middle rack, so they would not get too over done on the bottom...they turned out wonderful, so good that they really don't even need any frosting, but we my DH and my son love frosting so I will add it on the brownies. Thank you so much for posting such a wonderful recipe, I will be making these again very soon. :-)"
91392,15072,2004-03-27,4,"Good, but not our ultimate brownie.  Made the recipe exactly as written.  I do like a cocoa brownie, and this is a good one, but not quite the TOP.  Rose beautifully in the pan."
59780,15072,2004-09-03,5,I printed this recipe out for my 7 year old daughter Kiandra to make and she even let me have a taste ;). These were delciously moist and I realized that Kiandra did not even follow the directions correctly. She just measured everything in to the bowl and then mixed at the end. The batter was very thick. She also baked these in a 9X9 pan and so the brownies were nice and thick too! Thanks for posting~these will become a staple around here!
101823,15072,2005-03-19,4,"These were good chocolate brownies, but lacked the deep fudgy flavor that I had hoped for.  I also found my brownies to be still incredibly gooey in the middle after 30 minutes of baking.  They weren't even properly ""set"" and still wanted to run in the pan.  I popped them back in for about 10 more minutes, which did set them, but still left a much more mushy texture than I like.  I am searching for the perfect gooey, chewy, fudgy brownie.  These are good, but not quite what I wanted."
37036,15072,2006-05-30,5,"These brownies were really good!  I followed the directions, but omited the nuts.  I used Pam non-cooking spray to grease my pan and had no problem with them sticking.  I will make these again.  Thanks Virginia for posting! "
140806,15072,2006-09-06,5,This is the best cake-like brownie I have tried. I've never used the method of melting the shortening before. These puffed up beautifully in the oven. I topped with a thick layer of Andes mint chips. Had to hurry and hide half so DH wouldn't eat them all!
294000,15072,2006-10-07,5,"Here's another five stars for a fantastic brownie recipe.  Easy, moist, delicious.  And perfect after a long day working on house projects.  Even more perfect with mint-chocolate-chip ice cream!  Thanks!"
394077,15072,2006-12-06,5,"Wow, My favorite brownies recipe now and I have tried many.  The outside is crispy and inside is moist and chewy. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups only. Love it with icecream.  My DH loves it.  A keeper for sure.  Thank you for sharing it."
347822,15072,2007-01-15,3,Good recipe.
142464,15072,2007-01-21,5,"And I thought I had the best brownie recipe.  Boy...was I wrong.  These are to die for.  Never changed a thing, perfect and delicious just the way they are.  My brownie recipe has just taken a back seat to yours, Virginia.  Will definitely be making these on a regular basis from now on.  Thanks for posting."
255338,15072,2007-01-28,5,"Instead of walnuts, I used chocolate chips to make this even more chocolatey. These brownies are not as fudgy as I had hoped they would be, but they still taste good. My daughter loves them, so she said 5 stars. We were out of butter, so I used margarine. I feel that lining the pan with foil is a must. Thank you for posting."
402559,15072,2007-02-17,5,Used 1 cup of butter for the shortening. Other than that I made as written and they were some of the best brownies I have had! Thanks for sharing.
58836,15072,2007-03-22,4,Pretty good brownies.  I had to cook just a bit longer.  Easy to prepare and tasty.  Thanks!
331557,15072,2007-04-01,4,"I personally prefer my brownies to be less cakelike and more chewy but my boyfriend and his co-workers loved this recipe.  I am updating this to four stars, which I meant to do a long time ago, because these were much better the second day, especially when rewarmed in the microwave.  Thanks for sharing!"
158086,15072,2007-04-11,5,"great recipe, I used splenda for baking to cut down on the sugar and they were easy and turned out perfect...thanks"
140132,15072,2007-06-22,5,"These were soooo good.  My DD made these for us and we loved them.  I usually just buy the box mix, but will no longer.  This is so much better and moister.  Thank you for a great dessert.....Stephanie"
184723,15072,2007-09-04,5,These brownies were very good according to my husband and children... but were more cakelike than chewy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I will make again because they have been eating them and they were so eeeeaaaasy!  Thanks for posting!
185446,15072,2007-09-25,4,"Better than boxed and easy to assemble.  A quick, tasty brownie."
80998,15072,2008-02-14,5,"I have always chosen to make brownies froma box because I thought that homeade brownies didn't taste any better despite the effort.  However, my opinion has changed.  These are the best and easiest brownies ever.  I will make them again and again."
386849,15072,2008-03-24,5,"My favorite brownie recipe- will definitely add to my tried and true favorites list. The only thing I'd do differently is use my mixer- I tried it by hand and my batter was slightly lumpy. Thanks, Virginia!"
789516,15072,2008-12-12,3,"These tasted too much like the shortening to me, and not chocolately enough. Definitely recommend throwing in some chocolate chips or something!"
142559,15072,2008-09-02,5,"These were excellent brownies! Very fudgy and chewy - perfect! I omitted the nuts out of personal preference, but they turned out lovely, even in high altitude with no adjustments! Thanks for posting, these really were wonderful!"
218535,15072,2009-10-12,3,Good brownies but not perfect as the name suggests. I'll keep looking.
229524,15072,2010-03-13,5,"These are without a doubt the PERFECT brownies.  So chocolaty & fudgie.  I have tried a number of brownie recipes from this site, and none come even close to these.  Did throw in some chocolate chips and left out the nuts.  Decreased the sugar to 2 cups as suggested by another reviewer.  Also used parchment paper, which was a great suggestion by another reviewer.  You won't be disappointed if you try these."
1179225,15072,2010-04-29,5,Perfect! I added the nuts and a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I also sprayed foil and lined the pan. No stick and they were delicious! Thanks so much for posting.
222970,15072,2010-09-07,5,"Well, this is everything a brownie should be. I don't like using shortening for anything but pie crust, but I'll have to make an exception in this case. Five stars. I made it without nuts."
50969,15072,2010-11-29,4,"I made these for my SO on 11/23/10.I sort of followed the recipe as it was written( READ: messed up :) big time ) I didn't read the recipe right and put the cocoa and sugar in the same bowl, luckly I was able to get out most of the sugar. Then I added the cocoa and shortening to a large saucepan and went on with the recipe.I baked the brownies in a pre-heated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes. I let them cool for 30 min..The smell was so enticing, that as soon as they were cool enough I had to eat a couple. And both my SO and I really enjoyed the taste, moist and fudgy just what a brownie should be. Thanks for posting a brownie recipe that will be made again and, "" Keep Smilling :) """
928301,15072,2011-12-04,0,"Was difficult to cook as I chose to use a smaller pan so it could fit into my toaster oven.--the top was done, but the inside needed an extra 15 minutes on 325 with aluminum foil over it.  Because I'd always prefer to use my toaster oven rather than the big oven, I probably won't be making this again."
176615,15072,2012-03-15,5,Yummy! I used salted butter instead of shortening and forgot to cut down the salt. Next time I'd reduce it to 1/4-1/2 t. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
529278,15072,2012-09-02,5,"So delicious, so easy!  When I first got married, my grandma was horrified that I fed my husband brownies from a box.  She would be so happy now!  I've made these twice.  I had to substitute real butter for shortening once, and it was fine.  I do not believe in nuts in brownies, but I DO believe in chocolate chips :)  These were still warm when we cut in to them last night.  There were 9 kids and 6 adults there and we had the pan empty in minutes.  These are a winner!!!"
240552,15072,2012-12-14,5,"Excellent brownies! I've been making these since 2009, but I didn't realize that I hadn't reviewed them.  This is one of my go-to recipes!  I use coconut oil/butter mix instead of shortening to make it healthier, too."
187373,15072,2014-09-29,5,Yum! I underbaked them some and that was a good decision--liked it a little fudgy! Great treat for a girls night out.
142367,15072,2015-04-05,5,These are well named!  Thank you for sharing this recipe--they double well too!
189475,15072,2017-12-10,5,I was very happy with them but I prefer my brownies to be chewier so I’m trying to figure out what to change next time. I omitted the nuts and added a cup of milk chocolate chips instead. I also used butter instead of shortening. I used a glass 9x13 pan and baked them for 33 minutes.
26512,30951,2002-08-21,5,"I loved the flavor of this dish and it looks beautiful on the table. I only added a half teaspoon of sugar, as I was afraid it would be too sweet for our tastes, and it was just perfect. Great recipe, thanks for posting!"
22015,30951,2002-12-22,4,"Everyone loved the flavor, but not everyone liked the tomatos.  I did though.  Thought that this recipe was great.  I will make it again with tomatos for me and without for everyone else."
101823,30951,2003-09-03,5,"I make this frequently.  I use fresh or frozen green beans and have subbed diced and seeded roma tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes.  Everyone loves it.  Plus, it is an excellent way to get that variety of color (that the drs recommend) into your diet.  Yum!"
101034,30951,2004-01-14,5,"This was fabulous. The flavors blended so well together. I used fresh beans, fresh basil & fresh tomatoes. I found it to be almost sinful that something so healthy could be so good!!!! DH whoofed alot down, which makes me feel very happy, because he's very bad about eating his vegs. Thanks Merlot for this tasty side dish."
42720,30951,2004-05-25,5,"We picked a bunch of fresh green beans this past weekend.  I have been waiting for fresh ones just so I could try out this recipe.  Merlot, this recipe is outstanding.  We really enjoyed the change of pace in flavor and I am certain they were more healthy for us than cooked with bacon as I usually do.   I followed your recipe exactly except that I used the little grape sized tomatoes since that is what we had on hand.   Delicious green beans!
"
37449,30951,2004-06-07,5,I was surprised I liked this so much! Just the right amount of sweetness and garlic. I used garlic powder instead of salt and roma tomatoes. I used from the garden canned green beans. Fabulous! Thanks so much for a recipe I will make many times!
89831,30951,2004-06-12,5,"We just loved this dish! I made it tonight to go along side of your  Sauteed Chicken breast (recipe#31532) the two complimented perfectly..I was lucky to find lovely fresh green beans in my grocery store. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Another winner Merlot, thanks so much for posting, we enjoyed this, and I will make it again, next time with the green beans from my garden!...Kitten :)"
88099,30951,2004-07-05,5,These were great.  Had my first pick from the garden and wanted something different.  This was right on.  Nothing better than fresh vegies from the garden.  Thanks for posting
4470,30951,2004-10-17,5,"Wonderful eye appealing tasty recipe.  I cooked the beans aladente placed them in an oven proof dish cut the tomatoes in half, placed them with the beans - dotted with butter, used roasted garlic, dry basil and 30 minutes before serving popped them in a 350F oven - perfect, renjoyedvery much Thanks Merlot this is a do again for Company recipe err and just for us too"
36944,30951,2005-05-20,5,"Such an easy recipe that uses ingredients I always have on hand and it tastes delicious.  I used one can of green beans, drained and rinsed and sliced some grape tomatoes in half then followed the directions as written.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Merlot!"
38643,30951,2005-09-10,5,Even with canned green beans this recipe was a hit.  Can't wait to try it with fresh beans. The addition of the cherry tomatoes really adds to the eye appeal of this dish.
68960,30951,2006-08-23,5,"Merlot, these are so very tasty. I had fresh green beans and cherry tomatoes growing in my garden so this was the perfect recipe.  We like our beans quite crunchy so I zapped them in the microwave until just tender. Fabulous recipe, thank you for posting."
230557,30951,2007-01-11,4,"I love the color of this dish.  My kids didn't like the sweetness of it, but my husband has already requested that I make it again. Thanks very much."
126104,30951,2007-02-02,5,"I wasn't sure whether this would be all that good, even with all the ratings.  Well, now I believe.  This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't use all of of it up the first nite, and warmed the leftovers the next nite, and it was even better if that's possible.

I did use Splenda, and I substituted canned beans and canned stewed tomatoes, because I had them on hand.  The only thing I'll change the next time is to double up everything but the canned tomatoes.  Thanks, Merlot, for a new weekly recipe."
222564,30951,2007-02-24,5,"Pleasure for eye and mouth! Simple side that makes any meal pleasantly colorful, tasty and healthy. Prepares in no time at all and really is delicious, more than just the sum of its ingredients! Little balsamic vinegar can be added."
158086,30951,2007-02-25,5,Oh my goodness....these are to die for....I too added some balsamic vinegar and used splenda instead of sugar....now we have a new favorite green bean recipe...
138429,30951,2007-09-09,5,This has  got to be the ultimate green bean recipe. Great eye appeal and so very easy to prepare but with an abundance of flavor. I did cut back on the sugar just a touch. Another winner Merlot. Thanks!
240552,30951,2007-10-16,5,"Great side dish!  I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry.  I did half a recipe but should have done the same amount of butter and seasonings.  :)  Thanks, Merlot, for the recipe!!"
95743,30951,2008-01-17,5,Used 1/2tsp sugar and olive oil rather than butter on this delicious dish of fresh vegetables.  Very attractive.
125640,30951,2008-08-08,3,"Easy to make, but my husband and I didn't really care for this. If I do try it again, I would use garlic powder instead of garlic salt for a little more garlic flavor since you add salt to taste anyway. Thanks."
103876,30951,2009-05-03,5,Oh my gosh!  These beans are so great.  I have been looking for a recipe for fresh green beans and this is it.  My daughter ate about 1/2 pound by herself.  I have already made them twice in one week.  Thanks for posting!
13483,30951,2009-05-16,5,I made this with fresh beans and grape tomatoes. I made it the day before and served it as a cold side dish.  I like hot and cold dishes served on the same plate!!  This was really good and I will be doing this again.  Be great served cold at a BBQ. Thanks for the post Merlot.
60260,30951,2010-03-17,5,"I liked this side dish - it was different a fun way to combine green beans and tomatoes.  Instead of using garlic salt, I used a homemade garlic/salt/pepper combo and fresh basil instead of dried.  I might cut back the sugar just a tiny bit but it was good with the full amount too."
124190,30951,2010-07-09,5,"So delicous! I should have cooked the green beans a bit longer, but otherwise this was perfect. The seasonings are perfect, and they mesh well with the green beans and the tomatoes. Great recipe, thank you for posting!"
1179225,30951,2011-08-29,5,What a pretty and yummy dish. I'll be making this again. Thanks for posting.
64642,30951,2011-10-11,5,"I make this ALL the time.  So easy, so tasty and so beautiful."
400708,30951,2011-12-08,4,"DH wanted green beans with dinner and this looked so pretty I decided to try it.  I used fresh green beans, but canned stewed tomatoes as that's what I had.  Pretty simple, I used fresh garlic and then followed as directed.  Very nice and enjoyed by both me and DH.  Thanks so much for posting."
198154,30951,2013-09-21,5,I had some beans I got from the farmer&#039;s market that I needed to use up.  I used a little extra butter and garlic because I had more beans than called for. I also used a natural sugar substitute.  They were great.  Even my picky DD said &quot;You need to save this recipe!&quot;  Served with Grilled Chicken.
2549237,30951,2017-01-23,4,This was a really great side dish for us tonight. My husband wanted more and was highly disappointed when I told him that there wasn't anymore. I think this would be fabulous with an Italian meal. I paired it with Picnic Chicken and Suddenly salad and it was delicious. Thank you Merlot!
64203,24799,2005-03-18,5,"I,for one, appreciate this recipe being posted. My hard boiled eggs have never turned out ""just right"" and with this recipe they are perfect every time. The shells remove easily, the insides are cooked all the way through and aren't too dry,etc. I appreciate you posting this recipe! It worked great for us :)"
51011,24799,2005-03-27,5,Thanks so much!!! Super easy! Now my deviled eggs look perfect :)
160974,24799,2005-06-26,5,"I've been making my hard-boiled eggs this way for years, too! It's the only way for me. For high altitude in Colo. I bring to a full boil for 1 minute and then cover and rest for 18 minutes. In regular altitude I let rest for 14 minutes. I use the large eggs. I make a lot of egg salad and highly recommend this way.

Roxygirl in Colo."
169969,24799,2005-11-15,5,Perfect Egg! Thanks!
91392,24799,2005-12-11,4,"Egg shells stuck for me but the eggs were perfectly cooked, I'll try again."
207176,24799,2006-02-28,5,I always just put aggs in water and let it stay in boiling water for 12-15 minutes but this was easier!  Didn't have to watch it after it boiled. The yolk was a nice yellow (not that green color) Thanks!
222055,24799,2006-04-07,5,"This works great. It's just hard for me to decide how long to let stand in the hot water because I have different sized fresh eggs. Some work for me and some are hard to get the shell off, BUT- NO GREEN STUFF!!! TY!"
52125,24799,2006-05-19,5,"Oh my this is PERFECT! I just got done with my eggs for my potato salad and they are great, no gross green stuff at all. I followed your directions exactly and they were really perfect! I wanted to make them into deviled eggs, but I needed them for my potato salad, darn! I will use this recipe from now on! Its going in my most loved recipe folder. Thanks a bunch shortstuff.... oh and I sampled a few of the eggs that fell out of the bowl, EXCELLENT!"
182624,24799,2006-10-30,5,Easy and came out perfect!
358796,24799,2007-01-07,5,Finally! My eggs turned out perfect this way.
251626,24799,2007-05-17,5,I never had eggs that came out of the shell right before. These were the best ever.
229524,24799,2007-07-09,5,Thanks for posting this.  I live in Colorado and followed Roxygirl in Colorado suggestion on boiling for one minute and then cover and let rest for 18 minutes.  These eggs come out perfect.  Great idea of rinsing in cold water and using ice cubes.  Yolks come out a nice yellow color .
248023,24799,2007-08-31,5,This is how I always make my eggs...the yolks are a beautiful yellow with none of that gross grey ring!  It works for as many eggs you need...from 1- as many will fit in your pot.  Great technique that is fool proof each and every time!!!
386849,24799,2007-11-05,5,This is the best method for hard-boiled eggs! I have been doing it this way for years with perfect results every time. Thanks for posting!
126440,24799,2010-03-02,5,"Great, easy way to do eggs.  I find it best after cooling, to peel the eggs."
125640,24799,2008-03-22,2,"This method didn't work for me. Maybe an altitude problem.  The yolks were slightly undercooked and the shells stuck to the whites. They were okay sliced up in potato salad or just for eating on their own, but they definitely weren't going to cut it for deviled eggs like I planned. DH made a new batch. He boiled the water before adding the eggs and let them simmer over low heat, then cooled them in ice water. They turned out much better his way. Thanks anyway."
470351,24799,2008-07-29,3,"Sorry...I just dumped 8 raw eggs after using this method.  This is the 2nd time of tried this type of method for hard boiled eggs and both times it didn't work at all.  I brought eggs to a rolling boil and put lid on and let sit for 18 minutes (for large eggs!) and still the yolks weren't done in the center.  They peeled nicely...but not done.  I never really had a method for hardboiled eggs other than to just lightly boil it for about 15 minutes.  Always turned out fine (maybe a bit overdone on the yolk or a bit hard to peel) but at least I knew they were going to come out done.  I wanted this to work for me since it gave set parameters and my other method was pure luck.  I think I have to go back to my old method until I find something more certain since I don't like throwing away eggs.  Thanks anyway! EDIT:  For anyone experiencing my problem, you can try Kittencal's Perfect Hard-Boiled Eggs Recipe #259573.  I cooked and peeled my first perfect egg using this method instead."
400420,24799,2008-08-02,5,"DD just used this recipe and it worked perfectly for her.  She had them for breakfast, so didn't cool, just peeled them warm and ate.  Thanks for a great method that we'll continue to use!"
373817,24799,2008-11-27,4,For some reason this did not work for me. I must be egg challenged!
140132,24799,2008-12-09,3,"I'm not sure what happened, I followed the directions to a T but my eggs would not peel.  I wasted most of my egg whites because it wouldn't peel.  I used my older eggs.  I gave this 3 stars because I'm not done with this recipe, I am planning on trying the method again and if it works out better I will upgrade my review.  I too must be egg challenged....lol. Thank for posting the method, I know it must work from all the reviews, so I will try again soon."
39301,24799,2009-04-10,5,"This has been my bookmarked go-to hard boiled egg recipe ever since you posted it in 2002 and I just noticed today that I never reveiwed it!  These eggs turn out perfect every time.  Thanks for taking the time to post this here.  I can never remember the technique from one time to the next, so I'm grateful to have this one saved in my recipe box."
286851,24799,2009-04-12,5,Perfect hard-boiled eggs every time. This is how I do mine as well. Thanks for posting.
333017,24799,2009-05-03,3,"Oh, I wanted to have perfect eggs, but I kinda had a bad feeling when 1 egg cracked just before the water came to a boil.  Being large eggs, I let them sit for 18 minutes, then plunged them into cold water.  Once I cracked them, some of the egg whites came off with the shell.  We must have pretty hardy eggs up here in Canuck land!!!"
350750,24799,2009-05-22,5,Thanks for a great easy method on cooking something so simple. Worked for me and I'll make my hard-boiled eggs this way all the time!
126104,24799,2009-05-25,5,"I made eggs the other day, and talk about a ragged mess. I remembered a recipe on Zaar that people raved about, and wasn't sure it was this one. I'm still not sure, BUT THIS IS WONDERFUL. I had put the eggs in water last nite, and forgotten them. Two eggs were cracked when I began this recipe. Even those two eggs came out perfect. The shells came off easy, and almost in one piece. No raggedy pieces. I've been making boiled eggs for 50 years now, and this absolutely was the best way to cook them. Thanks, shortstuff, for this ""recipe""."
407007,24799,2009-08-15,5,"This was SO easy and really, really helped with the peeling process. I used it to make hard boiled eggs for Recipe #97190. Thanks for sharing!"
15521,24799,2009-12-06,5,These eggs almost peeled themselves and the yolk was the most beautiful yellow color ever!  I will be using this method from now on!  I put in a bit of vinegar just to be safe.  Thank you so much!
369715,24799,2011-05-07,5,I followed the recipe as written other then I only used nine eggs. They were perfect.
362983,24799,2012-03-27,5,I LOVE this method. You get perfect eggs every single time. Thank you!
1179225,24799,2012-07-13,5,No grey ring and easy to peel. Perfect! Thanks for posting your technique.
400708,24799,2013-08-12,5,As an update - I continue to use this method and it&#039;s never failed me.  Love it!!&lt;br/&gt;Had to add my rating for this great tip on hard boiling eggs.  I followed the instructions exactly letting mine (farm fresh medium to large sized eggs) sit for 18 min as they where of varing sizes.  Came out so nice with no green around the edges.  Peeled easier than most fresh eggs and I was very pleased with the outcome.  I used this method to make my own recipe for Smoked salmon deviled eggs and I can&#039;t thank you enough for posting this recipe
285039,24799,2014-02-26,5,Perfect!
52543,117565,2005-08-01,5,"This is definitely the prelude to a PERFECT steak but I must give some credit to my hubby who manned the grill! I cut the quantities in half & marinated 2 top sirloin steaks for 10 hours; they were moist, tender & very tasty. Thanx Carol!"
124249,117565,2005-09-07,5,"Like everyone else we liked the flavor this gave to the steak. Very moist and juicy. I marinated my steaks for 24 hours.

Thanks KITTENCAL

Bullwinkle"
158086,117565,2007-07-07,5,this was to die for....we just loved it...was a big hit and will be making this marinade often.
402559,117565,2007-08-01,5,"The only thing I changed was I used honey mustard instead of Dijon because that is what I had. The meat came out very tender and flavorful, a little on the sweet side. Very good, will make again, thanks!"
251917,117565,2008-04-16,5,Thank you Carol for another awesome recipe!! I always know I can count on you to have a perfect recipe for my family!!
26512,117565,2008-05-26,4,"I used this marinade on a top sirloin with the idea in mind that it might help with flavor & texture on a cheaper cut of meat. Oddly enough, I was out of worcestershire, so I just used A-1. Seemed to work fine. i used a very coarse grind of English mustard and marinated for over 24 hours. The flavor was one that I really enjoyed, strong flavors but not too salty. Will keep this in the rotation for cheaper cuts of meat."
497077,117565,2008-05-27,5,I used this recipe for 2 strip steaks and marinated for about 12 hours. Grilled to medium-rare and they were so delicious and tender! Thank you for a great recipe!!!
4470,117565,2008-07-13,5,Can't fault this marinade - Excellent_  I had a very small filet that had been in the freezer for a while and wanted a marinade - This was perfect - gave a great flavor boost.  The steak was tender but then a small fiet usually is tender. Definite do again recipe  Thanks for posting
383346,117565,2008-07-29,5,Thanks Kit for another great marinade recipe.  I did like you suggested and used only 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard.  I used vegetable oil.  This was so tasty.  Made for Zaar Star Game.
173579,117565,2008-08-03,5,Very good marinade.  Will make again.
489552,117565,2008-08-31,5,"Well what can I say Kittencal......once again a excellent recipe.  My whole family loved it.  It was a beautiful day for BBQ and it was even better when I ended my day with a great meal.  My son has never had steak marinaded this way before, he loved it.  He had to have the recipe.
Thank you again Kittencal for a great recipe :)"
461834,117565,2008-09-20,5,"Just as the name says, this is absolutely wonderful and so tasty, perfect marinade for steak!!  Our grocery store had sirloin steaks on sale this week and I was able to get a large steak about 2 1/2 inches thick.  I served it with twice baked potatoes and your Recipe #116849.  Thanks for sharing!!  Made for zaar stars tag."
394077,117565,2008-12-28,5,"Kitten,  this is another keeper from your collection.  My family just loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and since it is raining today,  I pan fried it until desired doneness.  They devoured the steaks.  Thank you."
620763,117565,2009-02-12,5,"This is a great marinade. I marinated my steaks for 4 hours, but next time I will try to marinate longer for even more flavor. I did not add any additional seasonings before placing on the grill."
333017,117565,2009-03-07,5,"Ditto, ditto and ditto! Great marinade...wonderful taste...perfect steak! What more could you want!"
15521,117565,2009-04-19,4,"This was good, but oddly enough, I didn't think it was quite flavorful enough.  I might use some garlic salt on the steaks before I add the marinade next time."
172369,117565,2009-06-29,5,"This was wonderful! I only fix steak occasionally because it is not a favorite of mine, but I did enjoy this meal. Thank you Kitten!"
207176,117565,2009-07-02,5,I really enjoyed the marinade!  We all did.  I used a 1/3 cup of the olive oil and mixed it all up in a cup size measuring cup and and whisked it around.  I marinated a flank steak for 24 hours and poked a lot of holes in the meat with a tenderizing tool.  My husband grilled it and YUM!  Thanks again!
808027,117565,2009-07-03,5,"Usually I can take or leave steak, but after marinating ribeyes in this marinade, I found myself going back for seconds and thirds.  Yummy!  My whole family loved this...and it's our new ""go to"" marinade for steak.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  It did NOT disappoint!"
914720,117565,2009-08-12,5,"This was delicious, and I love that it uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I cut the oil to 2 T, with no negative effects.  Thanks for posting!"
8629,117565,2009-08-15,5,Great marinade.  I like how the flavors blend perfectly so that no one flavor dominates the marinade. I marinaded the rib eye steaks for 4 hours and then let come to almost room temperature for about 15 minutes.
355637,117565,2009-09-27,4,"Made for a very tender, tasty steak!"
198154,117565,2009-10-13,5,Wow! What a great marinade.  We used it for a steak and for a vegetarian beef kabob.  Both were excellent.  I used a combination of Balsamic and red wine vinegar (only because I didn't have enough Balsamic but didn't know it until I was making the marinade)  We will deffinately be making this again!
426903,117565,2010-01-10,5,"Very nice marinade, thanks for posting!"
810787,117565,2010-02-15,5,We made this for our Valentine's dinner. It was awesome!
18391,117565,2010-07-29,5,"An excellent marinade! I did not use quite enough garlic though, and used less oil, which was fine. Everyone loved it! Thanks!"
264017,117565,2010-12-23,5,"This is an outstanding marinade for steaks! I used it for a dinner with guests and everyone thought it was better than a steakhouse marinade. Thanks for another winner, Kitten!"
140132,117565,2013-04-08,5,We used your marinade recipe on some T-bones we had the other day.  This marinade makes them even more tender and delicious.  We used our normal steak seasoning on them and grilled for a delicious dinner.  Thank you very much Kittencal for this great recipe.  I loved the balsalmic vinegar in this.
222433,126611,2006-04-01,5,"This is a great salad. The only thing I did not have was tomatoes and I added a little bit of finely chopped onion. I served it as a main dish salad with garlic bread, but felt a little like it was too heavy for that (Probably because of the pesto)so next time and there will be a next time, I will serve it as a side dish. Would be great at a BBQ!!"
89831,126611,2006-04-22,5,"SO SO SO GOOD! I made this last night to serve at a BBQ get together tonight, I used my own pesto recipe for this (#144195) and subbed cheddar cheese in place of mozza. This is a fantastic recipe, thanks peaceful!...Kitten:)"
135887,126611,2006-06-24,4,I used home made pesto and halved the recipe using tortellini and no rotin.  Did not add green pepper or artichoke hearts because I didn't have any.  Very flavorful - will make again.
305531,126611,2006-07-05,5,"This is great!  I had to make a few substitutions because the tiny market where we were didn't have all of the ingredients.  I used penne, gouda cheese and basil pesto with macadamia nuts as substitutes. Got rave reviews.  Thanks for posting!"
173314,126611,2006-07-09,5,Very tasty pasta salad! I Let it chill overnite and just added a little wishbone olive oil vinegarette to wet it a bit.  Thanks
133174,126611,2006-07-30,5,"I made this and have been sampling it as I went.  It is fantastic.  I used fresh mozzarella and freshly grated parmesan.  I also added 1/2 a roasted red bell pepper.  Not having grape tomatoes, I used a fresh tomato from my garden.  This is really good stuff!"
294000,126611,2006-09-03,5,"This was so easy and tasted wonderful.  I only had shredded mozzarella but it worked fine.  Cut the recipe back for four people and left out the rotini.  This was a perfect light lunch and pleased both mom, dad, DH, and 18-month-old DD.  Thank you!"
136997,126611,2006-12-10,5,"So easy to put together. I used fresh mozzarella/parmesan cheese and red peppers. Don't care for the green ones. I also only had tri-colored tortellini on hand. Scaled the recipe back to serve just the two of us, so I omited the rotini.:)"
347822,126611,2007-01-16,5,"This is a great salad!! I love the cheese tortellini along with the pesto and all the veggies.  As suggested, I had to drizzle the olive oil and fresh parmesan before serving. I used canned artichokes in water and pesto.  Next time, I will try it with homemade pesto. Thank you loads for the posting."
64583,126611,2007-08-21,5,"What a great pasta salad this is.  I absolutely loved it!  A friend of mine made it for a weekend getaway and it was a big hit with everyone.  We served it as a side dish, but it would make a great main dish meal also."
74281,126611,2008-05-26,5,"My sister made this for a meal when I went to Tucson to visit, and although she said it didn't turn out as good as it normally does because she used jarred pesto instead of homemade, I thought it was FANTASTIC! The next day I went to her house again and she suggested heating it up and trying it that way and it was soooo great that way too! This is a great side dish, and also a great main dish salad. Try it, you'll love it!"
222970,126611,2007-09-22,5,"This will be rather a long comment because I have a lot to say about this wonderful recipe.

1) It makes a very big bowl of salad: six main dish servings with about six side servings left (ten main dish servings if you add the cheese).

2) I made a lighter version. I didn't add olive oil and I only used about 1 ounce of pesto. No extra salt or garlic. It could have used the garlic, at least 1/2 teaspoon. I didn't add the mozzarella either. It may need ""refreshing"" tomorrow.

3) Look at the nutrition facts! It's nutritious stuff. When you consider that a big mac has the same amount of calories (540) but much less real nutrition, I know which I would choose.

4) It is a little pricey to make: my cost was about 10.50 USD. It's also cheaper than big macs per serving.

5) It would be a great dish to take to a potluck and I agree with another reviewer that it would be about 25 potluck servings.

Thanks for the recipe!"
177933,126611,2007-11-02,5,"Great salad, I used Recipe #8650 and it turned out so good.  I used grape tomatoes, marinated artichokes, marinated mushrooms, fresh mozzarella and roasted red peppers- YUM!  I left out the rotini and just used the cheese tortalini, you really can do whatever you want with this.  You could even turn this into a warm dish, letting the chunks of mozz just slightly melt...hmm, might have to try that with the leftovers!  Thanks for a keeper!"
400420,126611,2008-01-25,5,"I just made this for a party I'm having tomorrow and I can't stop ""sampling"" it! This is so delicious I will definitely be making again!  Thank you!"
269331,126611,2008-03-03,5,I brought this to a potluck and everyone raved.  I omitted the bell pepper and used artichoke bottoms instead of hearts; I think next time Iâ€™ll use hearts. I also used a two color tortellini and tri-color rotiniâ€¦ so pretty.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
97579,126611,2008-07-17,5,This is wonderful!  My new favorite pasta salad!!!
140132,126611,2009-03-24,4,"This is a very good recipe.  I made this exactly as written and we enjoyed it very much.  I loved the addition of artichokes in this and the pesto gives it that distinct flavor unlike any other salad I've had.  I sent half of this salad with my DH and FIL on their work trip.  Thank you for posting, we will make this again."
126440,126611,2009-04-11,5,Excellent salad.  DH fell in love with this salad.  We used red instead of green pepper and added pepperoni as one reviewer suggested.  Served with Recipe #104628.  It was a great meal and will have it many times this summer.
333017,126611,2009-04-14,4,"I have tried something similar to this recipe many times, but for a change I used a garlic and parmesan cheese pesto.  (I did cut down on the garlic and the olive oil as there is alot in the pesto)  I am not fond of canned olives (to me there is a weird taste) so I get my olives from the deli.  This recipe is so very flexible, you can do anything to it and still get excellent results!!!"
47907,126611,2009-05-20,5,I don't know how I managed to forget to review this recipe since it is one of the BEST pasta salads I have ever made.  I made it for a bridal shower I threw and everyone loved it just as much as I did.  It was easy to make and the flavors are delicious.  Thanks for posting a keeper!!!!!
60260,126611,2009-05-31,4,I made the the recipe with just the tortellini and the rest as is.  It was perfect with our grilled fish that night.  My kids adored it.  I didn't use quite as much olive oil because it didn't need it.  I like the artichoke hearts - a fun treat in a pasta salad.
407007,126611,2010-04-11,5,"Fabulous! I was looking for a recipe that I could transport easily for my work lunches that was sustaining. I love this recipe! It was very easy to customize - I omitted the artichokes, bell pepper, and parmasan. I used whole wheat penne instead of rotini, and used spinach tortellini. The green pasta with the regular pasta made a nice color combo. I didn't use the olive oil and used low fat shredded mozzarella instead of cubed. Told ya I customized it! ;) But that's what's great - I never would have thought of this combo on my own. I cut it in half and it still made a TON of food, so I am looking forward to munching on this for a couple of days. Thank you so much for sharing - it's a keeper!"
318235,126611,2009-06-24,5,"Delicious, will definitely make again. My boyfriend had second helpings for ""dessert"". I didn't have any parmesan cheese (somebody was raiding the fridge after I went to bed the night before...) so I am looking forward to trying the recipe with that next time. I also think that in the future I will add some red onions because we love them and for some extra crunch. I don't care for celery but that was another ingredient that I thought might make a good texture addition for anyone who does like it. Also, I halved the recipe, but still used the Rotini, and we still had some leftovers (I expected us to) which were very good for lunch today without any additional prepping. The flavors melded together a little more and the recipe had a different taste than eating it luke warm last night for dinner, so it was two meals in one. Got to love that! Overall a keeper in my house. Thank you Wildflour!"
158086,126611,2009-08-30,5,"This is my new favorite salad!  I made this to feed the hungry people that was helping move my daughter into her new house....
They all raved about the salad and we ate most of it up..."
774665,126611,2010-06-09,5,I've made this so many times and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before now. It's a nice hearty salad and It's always popular.
32058,126611,2010-06-10,5,This was great. Several requests for the recipe.
44383,126611,2010-07-02,1,"For all the work involved in putting this together, I expected it to be a real hit at the last company potluck.  I got zero reaction which means no one really cared for it and there was a ton of leftovers that had to be thrown out.  Pretty much tasteless was my reaction.  Sorry, will not repeat nor recommend."
76951,126611,2010-08-15,0,"My whole family absolutely loved it.  DH repeated more than once, ""this is a keeper""; and when he's impressed, I KNOW it's a keeper!  This does make a lot, however.  We ate it for days."
174991,126611,2013-07-18,5,"I loved the flavor of this dish and to boot, no mayo.  I omitted the mozzarella and rotini as I was serving 4 people.  I know that I&#039;ll be making it often this summer because it is such a flexible dish."
198154,126611,2014-12-17,4,"Great recipe for a party or gathering- it is easy to put together, doesn&#039;t need to marinate for hours before serving, makes plenty and tastes good too! My family really liked this recipe. We will be making this one again!"
58836,76864,2005-08-15,5,Made these last night. It was late so I didn't eat one until this morning.  Yum Yum!! Wanted another but knew I better not.  Put in the freezer for company coming Labor Day weekend.  My new favorite cinnamon roll recipe.  Thanks!
232480,76864,2006-04-08,4,"I threw all the ingredients for the rolls in my bread machine and let it handle all the work of mixing.  Then I rolled it out and added the filling, rolled it up and cut them with some unwaxed dental floss.  Then, I left them to rise again for a while until they were nearly doubled in size - I think this is the key to getting the fluffy roll instead of a dense one.  I followed the directions and baked at 400 for the 10 minutes but next time will reduce the heat to 350 or 375 and bake for longer, as these were not quite done in the middle.  I let them cool slightly and then frosted them.  These are SO rich!  Definitely should be saved for a special treat and not a regular item since they are so chock full of butter, sugar, and cream cheese - but they are good!"
255338,76864,2006-09-11,5,"As I was about to type out this review, I realized that I forgot to add the 8 tbsps of margarine!! No wonder my icing came out a little thick. I added a little milk and it was okay though. Still, even with the missing butter, my husband said that the buns were wonderful, and they really were... soft and sweet and just delicious. Thank you for sharing."
176615,76864,2006-12-25,5,"Hands down, the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made. Dough was perfect, very tender, icing is fantastic. I also use Vietnamese cinnamom which is much more flavorful than the stuff you find at the grocery store and which makes a huge difference in this recipe. Used the bread machine to prepare the dough, formed the rolls, then refrigerated overnight. Let rise and baked in the morning. Everyone loved these!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
394077,76864,2007-06-27,5,"Excellent recipe. I've tried many and always come back to this one. The rolls came out light and fluffy and big. A definite keeper!!UPDATE:  I made the following changes: Instead of using all AP flour, I used 2 cups of bread flour and 2 cups of AP flour.  I also used 2 (1/4oz) packages of dry yeast.  These changes produced a perfect bread crumb.  For the icing,  I added 2 Tablespoons of fresh lemon juice.  This gave the icing a nice tangy not too sweet flavor.  WOW,  one of my friend came over and he ate 4 at once."
146047,76864,2007-07-15,5,"Update:  Tried the whole recipe this time and it was truly wonderful. We had relatives visiting and they loved these rolls!  I did add 2 tbsp of flour to the filling, as suggested by a previous reviewer, and that really worked like a charm to keep the filling inside the rolls rather than gooped up at the bottom.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!
Fri, Dec 29, 2006: Elissa, the icing for these rolls is wonderful! Buttery, creamy sweetness. Looking forward to preparing the whole recipe, at which point I'll assign stars. --Heather"
520150,76864,2007-08-19,5,"UPDATE: I made these again for my friends, but this time put them all in the same pan.  Much better.  They were so wonderful!  I could hear people talking about them the next day.  You sure have made me a hero.  Thank you again! :)  I made these for a group of friends. Usually I do muffins, but wanted to mix it up a bit. However, I put the individual rolls into muffin tins. After baking, I put them in muffin cups so they were ready to grab & go. I think doing that hampered the rolls from rising as much as they could have & made them crisper. Everyone loved these, so I am absolutely going to make them again, but put them all together in a pan. Then, after they are all baked, put them in individual muffin cups. Thank you very much for an awesome recipe!"
230557,76864,2007-10-01,3,"I have never eaten at Cinnabon but was curious to try something so 'famous'.  They were easy to make (I used the bread machine to mix and rise) and went together fast.  We loved the texture of the rolls but the filling and icing made them extremely sweet for our tastes.  Even my kids didn't finish theirs.  I guess we just don't have sweet teeth :)  I did make the dough again, but omitted the icing and used only half the filling - these went over much better."
91392,76864,2007-11-18,4,"Good, not as soft as I had hoped when baked.  I also halved the frosting and had plenty. Makes a big pan of rolls, be sure to use very good cinnamon."
240552,76864,2008-01-01,5,"Superb! I have been making these for a couple of years. I had seen the recipe on another site.  They get oohs and ahhhs every time!!  I used margarine in the dough and butter in the filling and icing. I used 1/4 c. in the icing.  Thanks for posting, Elissa!"
184723,76864,2008-01-08,4,"This was the 3rd time I used my new breadmaker and the dough came out soooo perfect!!!!  This recipe is great!  Next time I will definitely lower the heat to 350 or 375 and bake for longer, though.  I used a 9x13 glass baking dish and they were so doughy after even 13 minutes of baking.  My oven is very consistent and usually cooks things exactly at the time specified... but not this time.  Gooey is one thing, but undercooked is another.  The rest of the recipe is wonderful though and I will make these again and again.  So easy!!!! Thanks!"
111291,76864,2008-01-14,5,Delicious! The only change I made was to add 2 Tbs. flour to filling as suggested by another reviewer. Also used all butter instead of margarine.  Will make these again and again! Thanks.
359220,76864,2008-01-15,0,"No stars for now, but thought you'd like a giggle at my expense...was truckin' right along mixing yeast and milk, tossing in the other ingredients, kneaded it a bit, threw it in a bowl on my nice warm oven for the first 30 minutes and came back to check on it.  Looked okay, but while I was getting into the fridge for other dinner ingredients it dawned on me that I FORGOT THE EGGS!  I threw it back into my mixer bowl with the eggs, then it was soppy mess, so I added more flour until it was at least workable then patted it out on a board.  Filled it, barely got it to roll up, then sliced and put into muffin tins so it would hold its shape.  Needed 17 minutes like this and STILL turned out yummy.  I'll retry and come back to rate with stars."
632249,76864,2008-01-17,5,"I am the girl who goes to the mall just to smell the cinnamon buns. OH MY GOODNESS!!! I am in heaven.  This is a ""bang on"" copy cat recipe.  We all absolutely loved these cinnabons. Thanks so much Elissa!"
312577,76864,2008-02-04,3,"I think these were okay.  In looking at other recipes, I noticed that there was more butter in the filling in some of the cinnmon rolls.  I was going for more of the ""gooey"" cinnamon roll and this was not quite it.  It is a nice cinnamon roll though."
81611,76864,2008-04-08,4,"Way too sweet. I made 1 1/2x the recipe (I can max out my bread machine on dough cycle w/6 cups flour). I lessened the sugar in the dough, lessened the brown sugar in the filling (and mixed it w/sucanat), and still it was sweet, even to my killer sweet tooth. I didn't even use all my icing. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, w/a little gluten, and the dough was very nice. I liked the addition of pecans per one reviewer. I was able to get 2 dozen rolls (2 9x13 pans) out of the 1 1/2x recipe; they were not huge, but since they were so sweet, a little went a long way. I like the recipe and will use again, but w/less sugar all around. The icing is great, but I had too much of it, so I will make less next time."
222970,76864,2008-10-27,5,"Five star recipe (or more!)

Very good although also very high calorie!"
121185,76864,2008-12-28,5,"These really are the best!  I have been making them for 5+ years, every AM on Christmas Day (thank you EW!)  I now have my uncle and mom who choose to come over 1st thing in the morning for coffee and rolls instead of later in the day for the full X-mas dinner!"
142335,76864,2009-04-15,5,Delicious! I'm really glad I tried these. I used the 2tbls of flour suggestion and did a double rise. My ABM did not like this recipe as my dough was really runny. I kept adding flour and worked it with my hands until it was dough like and went from there. Lo and behold it worked. I'll tuck this recipe away for special occasions only. I just can't have these sitting around my kitchen calling my name on a regular basis.
226863,76864,2010-01-02,5,"I made these exactly as posted, adding a little flour to the cinnamon filling.  I used Saigan cinnamon for the first time with these....what a wow factor!  I didn't read the reviews before I made them, and wish I had so that I would have let them rise the second time before I cooked them.  These taste just like or better than Cinnabon!  Thanks for sharing!"
353131,76864,2009-12-28,5,100 stars would not be enough.Doubled the recipe and made for our family. There were 16 of us and I had 42 rolls. My sister said I had made way too many because we had two breakfast casseroles also.! We only had four rolls left and my nephews polished those off about an hour later. One of my BIL's ate 4 and wanted another. My nephew said I should sale these. Thanks for making our Christmas morning breakfast so special. This will be a tradition!!!This is the 5th time I have made these and everyone raves about them!!!
140132,76864,2010-05-11,5,"These are wonderful!  We (the kids and I) made these for our Mothers Day breakfast and they were really easy to make.  This is my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and I was very nervous.  They were simple to assemble.  We did add some chopped pecans to the cinnamon sugar mixture.  We had to adjust the bake time from 10 minutes to 17 minutes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Oh yea, we did double the frosting recipe thinking we would need it, we didn't.  There would have been plenty of frosting so next time we will know.  Thank you so much for this delicious roll that my whole family devoured."
1133190,76864,2010-11-06,5,I also used my bread machine for the dough and they turned out great!  I used butter instead of margarine and used a little less butter and a little more cream cheese in the frosting. Yum.  I'm pretty sure this will be our go-to cinnamon roll recipe going forward.
199020,76864,2011-01-08,5,My husband said this is THE BEST DESSERT he's EVER had! Better than any donut! That is the ultimate compliment in his book! Thanks for the recipe!
315055,76864,2011-03-31,4,"These were pretty good, but they didn't keep very well.  Rolls that were leftover the next day were harder (even though I had kept them covered) and putting them in the microwave for a little bit helped soften them, but didn't fix it 100%.  I recommend only making these if  you have a big enough group to eat them in one sitting."
142559,76864,2011-04-30,0,"I made the dough, filled, rolled and cut these and let them sit in a pan covered with plastic wrap overnight and baked in the morning.  Easier than it looks and they came out beautifully!  Next time I will definitely add pecans!  Thanks for posting!"
236170,76864,2011-09-15,5,The flavor of these rolls was amazing! My only problem was that they didn't rise very well in the oven - I should've read the reviews beforehand and done a second rising before baking. I'll do that next  time for sure! But even though they turned out a bit dense we still thought they were delicious. Sooo looking forward to trying them again!
187373,76864,2012-02-11,5,"Great cinnamon rolls! Made in the bread maker.  I think I make my rolls too small b/c I always get a lot more servings than listed. They also take a LOT more than 10 minutes to bake. Delicious, though! Thanks for posting!"
1052873,76864,2011-12-25,5,My computer sent my review before I was ready. These were great even though I screwed up just about every step. Can't wait to try again and do everything right! I overdid the microwave rising so was done at that point. Still worked well. Mixed butter and brown sugar/cinnamon like struesel.  Didn't have any cream cheese. Still fabulous.
810787,76864,2012-02-21,5,Yummy! I wish I had read the review about using the rolling pin to press down the sugar/cinnamon. I will try that the next time. The taste was great!
377039,76864,2013-05-15,4,"The rolls were delicious. The icing tasted like thick, sweet margarine. I would do this again but I&#039;d use softened real butter in the icing and reduce the amount of it, increasing the cream cheese to compensate. I also might take the suggestion of others and add a second rising."
489552,76864,2013-09-03,5,I made these a few weeks ago and forgot to review.  These are absolutely amazing Cinnamon rolls!  I didn&#039;t change a thing.  PERFECTION!!
368078,76864,2013-12-24,5,"OMG...these are amazing!!  I have never made cinnamon rolls before, as was so nervous to mess them up, but honestly they are sooo easy!  I made the dough in the bread maker, warming the milk slightly to about 85 degrees (30 seconds in the microwave).  The dough was a little sticky when I was working with it, so I just made sure to use plenty of flour so it didn&#039;t stick.  On one batch, I made the log and then refrigerated overnight and on the other I baked right away...both turned out great!  I frosted when they were slightly cool so that the icing didn&#039;t melt.  Yumm!!  People thought I had slaved away for hours ;)"
350750,76864,2014-02-03,5,5 stars from this family!  I used the KitchenAid to mix this up.  These were enjoyed with a bowl of chili. Thank you!
937635,76864,2014-06-16,5,"Just like Cinnabons, AMAZING! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I did most of the work the night before with my stand mixer. I rolled the dough and sliced it, putting the rolls on a large baking pan. Covered them with plastic wrap and put them in the fridge overnight. Woke up at 4am and put them out on the counter (turned the dishwasher on beneath them to aid in rising). Popped them in the oven at 6 and they were a delicious delightful treat for the family breakfast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I did cut down the powdered sugar and butter (1.25 cups sugar, 5 tbs butter, 4 oz cream cheese) in the frosting and up the cream cheese because I am entirely addicted to cream cheese. Thanks so much for the keepr, Lightly Toasted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*400 convection 15 minutes. Use all brown sugar."
1581225,76864,2017-02-04,5,"These were really tasty and enjoyed by my whole family. They certainly didn't last long. The only downside to making these, is I found it to be a very messy process. There was a lot of cleaning up to do. It was worth it, however I don't think I'd find myself making these again because of how fiddly and messy they are. I'd probably rather buy them from my local bakery."
44383,38298,2004-04-10,5,"Super! And I'm not a big soup fan.  I thickened this up with a bit of instant potato flakes but otherwise, made it exactly as stated.  Lasted us two nights and was even better the second.  We'd never eaten kale before so this was a real adventure for us.  Thanks for posting this recipe, I'll be doing this one many times over. "
101034,38298,2005-02-02,5,"This is my favorite soup at the Olive Garden and this recipe is a definite clone!!!! It is so good. I used hot Italian sausage, which I removed from their casings and cooked and crumbled. All I had on hand was fresh baby spinach, so I subbed that for the kale. The blend of flavors is awesome and the consistency was just perfect. I did use alittle less water and one extra potato. Thanks for sharing."
64642,38298,2005-04-13,5,"An excellent, easy to make soup."
252816,38298,2005-10-20,5,"We ate at O.G. just yesterday and had the toscana soup. I came home and made this version with these exceptions. I used spicy italian sausage.I omitted the bacon.I used 1/2 the cream.Could of used 1/2&1/2. I used 2 extra potatoes. I found the kale had to be cooked longer(leaves only,no stem)so,I cooked it with the potatoes.Rough mashed the potatoes..Just like Olive Gardens..Excellent soup..Thank You..."
126440,38298,2012-03-14,5,I made half a recipe for the two of us and it was perfect.  I used Bob Evans hot sausage and kale (from bountiful baskets) What a great soup!
173579,38298,2006-03-17,5,This was a very tasty soup.  Next time I will put a few more potatoes and mash them up a little so it will be thicker.  My DS really liked it.  Will be making this again soon.  Thanks for posting.
95743,38298,2006-04-13,5,"There's a reason for 79 great reviews.  Simple, straight-forward and delicious.  I used evaporated milk rather than cream.  Didn't miss the saturated fat.  I sauteed the onion and garlic before adding the liquids."
125640,38298,2006-07-31,5,"Served this for a small dinner party to rave reviews. It was a more filling soup than I was expecting though. I was planning to serve it as a starter with homemade breadsticks and it was really more of a meal in itself. I used half sweet turkey sausage and 1/2 hot Italian sausage, 2 strips of real bacon and an extra potato. The result was a delicious, hearty soup that could serve 6-8 people by itself for dinner. -- posted Jan 15, 2006
This time I couldn't find kale at the grocery store and just decided to use some leftover cabbage I had at home. When it came time to put it in I realized that the cabbage had gone bad so I dug through my freezer and found some frozen spinach. I had to cook it a few extra minutes, but it was great in this soup, so if you're not big on kale or have a hard time finding it, spinach turned out to be a great alternative."
358796,38298,2006-10-02,4,"Tasted very close to the restaurant! I used spicy italian sausage and removed the casings, cooked then crumbled. I cooked the onion & garlic in a bit of olive oil first, to get the flavors going, then I added the broth, water & potatoes. Make sure to really drain the sausage and pat all grease off. I drained it, but still had some greasy red residue from the sausage float to the surface which was not very attractive. This had really rich, nice flavor and will make again."
377581,38298,2007-01-10,5,"Wow! Yummy! I have always gotton rave reviews from this recipe. Delicious and easy. I sauteed the onions and garlic in a little oil before adding to the soup and I want to try it with 1/4 tsp red chili flakes sprinkled in before simmering, but other than that wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for this keeper!!"
88099,38298,2007-01-23,5,This soup is actually better than the OG soup we have here.  I made this for our home study group and we all loved it.  I made exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  Have made it twice since first trying it.  One of my favorite soups now.  Thanks for posting.
499050,38298,2007-05-28,5,Yum!
285039,38298,2007-11-11,5,"Very good flavor.  I was at Olive Garden last week and tried a spoonful of this and fell in love.  The OG version is a bit thicker, so I took about 2 cups of potatoes out and pureed them in my food processor -- still not thick enough.  Next time I might make this adding some mashed potatoes in addition to the sliced potatoes it calls for.  I will also chop the kale in smaller pieces, but other than that it is fab!"
140132,38298,2008-04-18,4,I have never had the Olive Gardens before but this is fantastic.  My family enjoyed this very much. Thank you for posting Cycle Michael........Stephanie
386849,38298,2008-05-06,4,Great tasting soup!  I'm on a lactose-free diet and didnt add the whipping cream.  It still tasted great! Thanks!
229850,38298,2008-05-10,5,"Never had this before, we loved it !!"
226863,38298,2008-12-27,4,"I'm sure this was good as published. I really enjoyed it, although I made some changes. I sauteed my onions and garlic in the grease from the bacon (I didn't use bacon bits, just crumbled up two pieces of bacon). This released the flavor of the onions and kept them from having a rubbery texture. I also used homemade chicken stock, so I needed more salt for the finished product. I used a pound and a half of italian sausage, standard packaging at my grocery store! I used kale this time, but next time I will use spinach. The kale was just a little too tough in the cook time allowed. I also topped it off with shredded italian cheeses. Next time I will increase the spinach/kale by half and also increase the potatoes by half. I've never had Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana, but I think this is wonderful. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!"
189475,38298,2009-01-24,5,"This was fantastic! It tasted exactly the same as the Zuppa Toscana at the Olive Garden, which is my favorite soup. I go to Olive Garden just for that soup, so I'm glad I found this recipe on here. It will save me a lot of money. Thanks for posting it! I followed the recipe exactly as posted and it was perfect. I served it to my mom and her boyfriend and they both loved it. He hates green veggies but he loved the soup enough to eat the kale, which was surprising. I will definitely be making this again, and next time I'll serve it with the copycat Olive Garden Fettuccine Alfredo recipe."
131021,38298,2010-01-29,5,This was the closest I have tasted to the real thing. I think there is still some element missing but I gave it 5 stars because I made a couple of changes. I used about 3/4 lb turkey sausage that I pan fried then drained. I also added more potato and used whole milk instead of cream. I also subbed some more chicken stock for water. I will make this again as going out to Olive Garden is getting too cost prohibitive. I also left out the bacon bits but it was still quite yummy.
54678,38298,2010-02-16,5,"A keeper!! A repeater!! We used moose meat italian sausage, no bacon, extra garlic, all chicken broth, swiss chard and evaporated milk. A great soup to come back to camp after ice fishing. Served up with some cheese bannock!!"
222564,38298,2010-06-23,5,This is wonderful comfort food!
1122161,38298,2010-11-05,4,Great recipe!
74281,38298,2010-11-08,5,"This is an excellent soup. I did not bake the sausage, instead I sauteed it in the soup pan before going forward with the rest of the directions. I also let kale simmer for about 5 minutes before adding the cream because we like our kale a little softer. Served with freshly grated parmesean cheese as garnish and crusty rolls for dipping,"
1133190,38298,2010-12-11,4,"We had never had a Zuppa Toscana soup before.  Everyone who tried it was in agreement that the soup was good, but maybe not great.  That could just be a taste preference.  My only complaint about the recipe was that my sausage was not done after 30 min at 300, but maybe thats just the type of sausage I was using?  I had to turn up the temp and cook for nearly a half hour longer than directed.  I also felt there was maybe too much sausage called for.  I cooked 1 lb (5 or 6 links) but ended up leaving out one of them because I thought it would be too much. Honestly though, I think it's mostly preference, I don't like sausage that much to begin with so that could be the problem.  It was fun to try something new though!"
47559,38298,2011-04-03,4,"I've never had the Olive Garden version, but thought that this was a lovely and comforting soup for a satisfying weeknight meal.  I did not use the bacon bits, and added some red pepper flakes for some zip."
653438,38298,2011-04-05,5,Very very good.  I followed the directions only using half-n-half and adding some red pepper flakes.  Definately a keeper.  Going into my Favorites of 2011.  Thank you.  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag.
316717,38298,2013-11-05,5,Just like Olive Garden!
439797,38298,2014-04-26,5,Delicious and easy to make!
333017,38298,2014-04-28,5,"OMG was this delicious!!!  I used frozen bacon, chicken broth and whipping cream that I had in my freezer.  I added 4 garlic cloves...well, because we love garlic!!!  Fast, easy and really good!   Kudos on the find!!!"
91392,38298,2015-02-07,5,"Super, but not health food."
1581225,38298,2017-01-16,5,"I was sceptical about trying this because I don't usually like Italian sausages added to dishes such as spaghetti sauce or lasagne but I gave it a shot because of all the high ratings. The ratings were right, so flavourful and different! I think the quality of the sausages would make a big difference. I used Italian meatballs (made from sausage) I found in my supermarket. I also found the potatoes really absorbed all the yummy flavour and were my favourite part of the dish! I will add this soup to my folder to make again."
146486,66575,2004-08-09,5,I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out beautifully.  Was perfect for a large crowd since it made so much!
64583,66575,2005-02-06,5,"Delicious!  I didn't add the bananas until just before serving, that way they wouldn't get mushy.  Also didn't add the sugar because it seemed just sweet enough.  I'll be making this again this week for a Cub Scout potluck dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe."
58836,66575,2005-08-15,5,Made this for a school function and it turned out really good.  There were so many other desserts there it didn't all get eaten but it got rave reviews.  Thanks.
138429,66575,2005-12-13,5,"Great recipe. After dinner a number of people went back for seconds and called it their dessert. I added a can of fruit cocktail, can of mandarin oranges peaches,pineapple, grapes and wild blueberries. I'm not sure if I would add the wild blueberries  again as they turned the other fruit   a hint of blue. I did not add any extra sugar.  I will be making this again over the holidays. Thank-you for this great recipe."
101823,66575,2006-04-21,4,"I prepared this very sweet salad for a Community Center event.  I only had green grapes on hand and omitted the optional sugar.  The salad was well received, and I came home with an empty bowl.  I did seem to have a lot of dressing, though and might include more fruit in the future."
142559,66575,2006-08-27,4,"Very good!! I used the large box of instant FF/SF vanilla pudding and green grapes (all that I had on hand). Next time I will use the smaller box of pudding, as the large box made it soupy (error on my part); the green grapes were too tart and I think the red would be better, as suggested in the recipe (again, another error on my part). All in all, this was very good, and even better the next day.  Let it chill for as long as possible. Very easy to make and I will be making this again!!"
103876,66575,2006-09-27,5,This is a great recipe!  We made it for my mom's birthday party and the bowl was wiped clean.  The flavor was really good and not overly sweet.  Will definitely make again.
185446,66575,2006-11-05,4,"Very tasty & easy.  Make sure you are serving a crowd, as this makes alot.  I made it for just five people, so now we'll be eating leftovers (hooray!) "
59780,66575,2006-12-19,4,I made this for a Christmas Brunch and it tasted really good except I found that it had way too much liquid when you did not drain the cans. Next time I would drain half the liquid off each can. I did not add blueberries as they were so expensive at this time of year. Thanks for posting this recipe :)
140132,66575,2007-01-30,5,"This is a very versitile recipe.  I needed something to add to dinner and found this recipe.  Since it was blizzarding outside I used what fruit I had in the house and it still turned out wonderful. I subbed kiwi chunked up in place of the strawberries and I used 1/4 pt of fresh raspberries in place of the blueberries.  It was terrific.  You are right ,, it is the pudding in the sauce that makes this dish.  I plan on making it many different ways all year long.  Thank you for such a forgiving recipe that has the same results every time.....Stephanie"
33159,66575,2007-12-26,4,This is a nice fruit salad - good selection/combination of different fruit.  I liked the addition of the banana.  I don't think the vanilla pudding helped or hindered the flavour.
222433,66575,2007-03-08,5,This is a great recipe! Very versitile to what you have on hand. I think it is wonderful with any combination of fruit. You can't go wrong with this! Thanks!
394077,66575,2007-03-18,4,Delish! I love to make dishes that both children and adults love. This is one of them. I skipped the extra sugar because the pudding was sweet enough.
461834,66575,2007-04-09,4,"Very quick and tasty fruit salad.  I used a can of mandarin oranges, pineapple tidbits and sliced peaches.  I added fresh red grapes and bananas.  I did drain the canned fruit and saved some of the juice from the oranges to mix with the vanilla pudding. I mixed it all together, except bananas, the night before easter.  Kids especially loved this dish."
32058,66575,2008-02-07,5,"Made this as a quick dinner side.  It was delicious.  I had to use what I had, so no strawberries or blueberries (Next time I will).  I did add a can of mandarin oranges and omitted sugar.  You really don't need it!"
489552,66575,2007-06-17,5,"Wow I just finished making this to have after our Roast.  I cheated and tasted it (LOL) and OH MY!! Fantastic!  The best fruit salad I have ever made.  I followed the recipe except I added green grapes instead of red (I perfer green grapes) I don't like blueberries so I skipped those.  However I added raspberries, blackberries.  Looks delightful.
I also followed everyone's else advice and skipped the sugar, tastes sweet as is.
I will serve this with a bit of whipped cream :) I can already taste it, mouth watering :)

Thank you for a great refreshing desert :)"
359220,66575,2007-08-15,4,"This quick and cool side dish got a great review from my fruit-hating DH.  You can't get much easier than dumping everything into a bowl, stirring and eating.  I used a can of peach slices, a small can of pineapple chunks and a handful of green grapes (all I had on hand).  I can't wait to try this with other fruits like mandarin oranges and strawberries...and neither can DH!  Thanks Laura!"
229850,66575,2007-08-20,5,"Luv this, I used to make something similar with sugar free pudding, this is a great recipe is you are trying to keep it low fat, or using only natual sugars. I did make this recipe as written for a party, and was well recieved. Thanx for reminding me of a great recipe."
358796,66575,2007-08-25,5,"This is a very sweet tasting dessert-style fruit salad. Next time I'd leave the strawberries out, they got mushy quickly."
407007,66575,2007-11-24,3,"I made this for a work potluck with mixed results. I really liked it, but it wasn't as well received by my coworkers as I would've liked. I tried a little bowl before I took it to work and it tasted and looked delicious. however, when I got it to work, the blueberries made the other fruits a blueish tint and the bananas began to look soggy and so the entire dish wasn't as appetizing as it was before I traveled with it. so, since it had a wonderful flavor and looked beautiful when I tried it, I would recommend serving it at *home* where you can make it just prior to serving so it remains looking beautiful and tasting wonderful. I loved how easy it was to make and as you can see from my picture, it did look beautiful! I will make this recipe again, just not take to a potluck. thanks for sharing it!"
176615,66575,2008-03-16,5,"Yummy! Made with ingredients stated, omitting sugar, and added a can of mandarin oranges, drained. Whisked the pudding mix with canned juices, then added paches, pineapple, mandarin oranges, and grapes. Stirred in the strawberries, blueberries, and bananas (used two) just before serving. Makes a lot of sauce, in fact could add a lot more fruit and it would still be good. I don't like fruit with heavy dressings, so the consistency was just right for me. Very pretty, easy, and nice to make especially before lots of summer fruits are in season. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
185926,66575,2008-03-16,5,"I used one can of mandarin oranges in light syrup.  The pinneapple, strawberries, grapes, banana, blueberries were all fresh (washed and towel dried to remove excess water).  No sugar was added.  I drained the syrup into the bowl, added the sugar-free fat-free vanilla pudding and whished to get most of the lumps out.  Folded in all the fruit with a silicon spatula, then refrigerate and serve.  Thank you for the pudding advise - excellent idea."
386849,66575,2008-05-24,4,"Tasty fruit salad, easy to make.  Thanks!"
774665,66575,2008-05-24,5,We served this over a scoop of ice cream and the two went well together. It was the perfect ending to a great meal. Thanks!
38643,66575,2008-07-13,5,"Great fruit salad. I too, used only the pineapple juice and mixed it together before adding it to the fruit salad. Will definately make this again."
13483,66575,2008-09-03,5,"This was just a great, refreshing and different salad.  I served it at a dinner I put on for friends.  The pudding puts this over the top I think.  And talk about easy to do!!!!!   Really enjoyed this.  Thanks Laura70 for this post."
789516,66575,2010-07-17,5,Delicious.  I used  canned peaches in water to cut back on the sugar.
199020,66575,2009-05-20,4,"Not my favorite, but very good fruit salad. I added bananas and walnuts and left out the sugar.  Despite advice from other reviewers to cut down the juice, I added it all in.  I started out with less, but I think it tastes better juicy."
198154,66575,2009-05-31,5,"We were a little uncertain about putting pudding mix in fruit salad, but I am glad we tried it. I used fit and active canned pineapple and canned peaches.  I left out the bananas because ours were a little too ripe.  I only used 5 tsp sugar , and will probably use a llittle less next time. Everyone liked this, even DH who isn't a big fruit eater.  This is a keeper. Thanks!"
126440,66575,2010-06-01,5,Great salad which can be used as a dessert too.  Easy to make and loved the sauce.
191533,66575,2011-05-14,4,Very good. No need to add sugar.
187373,66575,2011-09-05,4,"Good recipe, although a bit soupy, even though I only used the juice from one 15 oz can of peaches. I added some extra fruit--extra banana and an apple to soak up some of the juice.  Good made a few hours beforehand, but wouldn't make it up a day in advance. Thanks for posting--will use again!"
1052873,66575,2012-07-21,4,"Used can of sliced peaches, can of sliced  pears, blueberries, banana, sweet cherries, and cantaloupe. The sweet cherries were a mistake - turned it all a lovely shade of purple. Used 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cornstarch in place of pudding mix."
969481,107997,2009-10-10,4,"Quick, simple, delicious!"
22015,107997,2005-01-12,5,I can't believe that I'm the first to review these but I know I won't be the last.   This recipe turns out as good tasting as the picture is good looking.    My dh did find it a bit spicy so next time I will cut back on the red pepper flakes but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.   A great weeknight meal when you're in a hurry that is nice enough to impress guests.  Thanks for posting it.
104295,107997,2005-02-26,5,This was really good.  We used previously frozen shrimp and just heated them a tad.  The sauce was excellent.  Left out the red pepper and used Old Bay as the spice.  Served with chia's baked latkes and it was lovely.  Thanks!
168462,107997,2005-03-12,5,Fast and easy. Great tasting recipe. I thought that the lemon flavour would be too strong but it was perfect. Thanks for the rcipe.
54678,107997,2005-07-07,5,"We used 31/40 count shrimp, no lemon zest or parsley.Didn't have the Mtl Stk spice but did have Mtl Chkn Spice so used that. AFter cooking in pan, we removed the shrimp and finished up on bbq to top a caesar salad, soaked up the pan sauce with some nice bread. YUMMY"
53932,107997,2005-07-29,5,"Great, easy recipe.  I didn't change a thing in this recipe.  It's perfect as is."
46660,107997,2005-08-21,5,"These are great shrimp!  I used McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning, and an extra clove of garlic.  We had it with a Caesar salad and rice pilaf.  I always thought that the steak seasoning would be good on meats other than steak, but had never tried it.  This was such a tasty and simple recipe!"
185446,107997,2005-09-24,5,"Shrimp is always on sale at our grocery store.  Now I have a great recipe to go with those ""buy one, get one free"" bags of shrimp.  Makes an easy & delicious lunch or dinner.  Thanks, Chippie!"
29782,107997,2006-01-09,5,Fantastic recipe!! DH and I just totally demolish the whole pan full. Most excellant recipe and I am most certain we will be having this again and again. THanks for sharing your recipe!
142367,107997,2006-01-31,5,This recipe is so easy and good. I left out the lemon zest and steak seasoning as I did not have them.  I added some pepper and salt.  I tried cooking them once with cayenne and once with the pepper flakes--I think it is better with the pepper flakes.  Thanks for sharing.
36944,107997,2006-02-22,5,"Fast, easy and my DH loved it!  I served it with recipe #29172, salad and french bread.  Thank you for sharing your delicious recipe Chippie!"
97579,107997,2006-04-03,5,As I started to put this recipe together I realized I was out of the Steak Seasoning so I used Salt & Pepper.  This recipe was awesome!  The whole family loved it.  Very tasty and I can only imagine if I would have had the steak seasoning it would have been even more tasty!  Steak seasoning is on my shopping list - can't wait to make again!
187281,107997,2006-04-24,5,"A+ dish!  I loved it but my non-shrimp lovers in my house did not.  But, they don't like shrimp so their opinion doesn't, right? I loved the fact that the shrimps were removed from the juice because it purifies the flavor.  The juices that shrimp release during pan frying impart a fishy flavor.  This recipe method solves it and tosses the shrimp in a delicious sauce.  I think this would be good served cold for a brunch too.  Recommended!"
13483,107997,2006-05-26,5,This is good enough for company fare and I will be doing it for company in two days time!!  I will double the recipe.  I used Old Bay Seasoning and cilantro. Thanks for posting this Chippie
230557,107997,2006-07-05,4,"Pretty good shrimp and easy to make, though not quite the best flavor for us. Thanks!"
231054,107997,2006-07-13,0,"I'm not going to select any stars because I don't want to lower your overall rating -- but this was just not the dish for us.  I love hot stuff -- but it was a little too hot for me.  I think I'll just stick to Shrimp Scampi.  I KNOW this has to be a great recipe -- as evidenced by all the stars it has received.  So on behalf of all of those folks, thanks for posting a recipe that has been so very popular.  I'll search around for some of your other recipes to try.  Happy cooking.  Bobbie"
55578,107997,2006-11-21,5,Easy and tasty.  I served this with wild and regular rice and broccoli.  My DS gave it 5 stars! Thanks for the recipe.
355637,107997,2007-02-23,4,Pretty good... I love that steak seasoning - don't leave it out!
177933,107997,2007-03-15,5,"This shrimp was soooooo wonderful. We savored every last bite and can't wait to make it again. It's like a low-fat shrimp scampi, but there is nothing low-fat about the taste. I used only 1/2 the oil and had 12 jumbo shrimp from costco. Very spicy, just how we like it...but don't let that keep you from trying it, just leave out the red pepper flakes. I did not have lemon zest, so I just skipped it and I used dried parsley because it's what I had. Thank you for an instant FAVORITE!  I am editing this to note that I smashed and then chopped the garlic, I just couldn't see not eating that yummy garlic!!  And...we are having it again tonight!"
316717,107997,2007-04-06,5,"followed everything to the ""T"" except minus the lemon zest and parsley since i didn't have any of those on hand. everything still came out very yummy! delicious! just a little spicy for my kids but for us it was perfect. thank you for sharing!"
278113,107997,2007-05-23,5,"yep, another 5 stars for me! I did add a tsp. of hoisen sauce to mine, and they were so yummy!!"
26512,107997,2007-07-19,5,"This recipe has quickly become one of our favorites. I do not make it in a pan, I mix all the ingredients and marinate the shrimp for 30 minutes then thread on skewers and grill. Great flavor. I add a bit of paprika for color and in place of the 1 tbsp of parsley, use a combination of chives, parsley, thyme, oregano and basil from the garden. Really an outstanding, easy and flavorful recipe."
35526,107997,2007-08-27,5,"I ended up increasing this recipe to make 3 pounds of shrimp for a small party.  I did 3 batches total.  By the time I was putting the second batch on the serving platter on the buffet the first batch was almost gone.  Same was true with the third.  Then they were wiping out the bowl with bread!  I think the lemon zest is really what made the dish so outstanding and different than other similar dishes posted here.  GREAT DISH, went over very very well with my crowd and I'll be making it again."
126104,107997,2007-10-21,5,"Well, thanks Rachael and Chippie.  I used cooked shrimpt, but I think this might have been meant for raw shrimp.  I added the seasonings quickly, and didn't saute them long.  I did add 4 cloves of garlic, because I love garlic.  I'll continue doing that.  It was absolutely delicious.

This will be a new favorite."
142335,107997,2007-11-20,5,I've been experimenting with this since it's so delicious and easy. Last night I also added fresh chopped tomatoes and green onions. I removed the shrimp from the grill pan and grilled fresh crusty bread in the juices. Then I served the shrimp on top of the bread. The bread and the shrimp were amazing. This is now my favorite way to serve this dish. I wish I had remembered to take a picture it was beautiful!
140132,107997,2007-12-30,5,"Delicious.  I made this for Christmas EVe and it was enjoyed by all.  We really liked the flavor of these and will use this recipe from now on.....Thanks, STephanie"
95743,107997,2008-01-09,5,Simple and excellent.  We served it over fresh greens.
579298,107997,2008-01-13,5,This was a great quick way to make delicios shrimp! The only flaw I stumbled across is that it is a touch salty. I recommend using a non-salted steak seasoning :)
37036,107997,2008-01-20,4,"The shrimp had a good flavor.  I expected them to be a little more spicy, so I will add more spice next time.  I love the fact that they were ready in no time.  I served this with a baked potato and salad.  Will make again.  Thank you Chippie!"
632249,107997,2008-06-01,5,Fantastic! Thx Chippie
236170,107997,2008-06-02,5,This was so incredibly easy and delicious! I loved how fast it was to prep and cook.
470351,107997,2008-06-10,5,"Just perfect!  Amazing how something so simple and quick could taste so delicious.  The seasoning added in this recipe completely accented the shrimp while still allowing you to taste the great taste of quality shrimp.  I didn't use jumbo shrimp...probably more medium sized.  I also didn't use Montreal Seasoning since the store didn't carry it but they made their own version of the Montreal Seasoning and it was wonderful!  Can't believe I haven't tried the seasoning before.  I eyeballed the zest and juice, increased the garlic (of course!) and the crushed red pepper.  Even my 4 year old liked it but told me it made his lips burn!  haha  I did think it had a nice kick.  I will definitely make this again.  I served this tonight with butter/parmesan pasta and balsamic cauliflower.  Wonderful."
847160,107997,2008-07-25,4,that was good and eazy thanks
142559,107997,2008-09-27,5,We substituted the red pepper flakes and seasoning (have used that particular seasoning before on steak and found it to be too peppery) for Old Bay (suggestion from another reviewer!) and it came out beautifully!  Thanks for posting!
394077,107997,2009-01-18,5,"I love it.  The flavor is out of this world and so easy.  But the next time,  I will have to double the sauce because the sauce is great!!!  Also, it got a bit dry while cooking so I added 1/4 cup of chicken stock but the next time,  I will try it with white wine instead. I also used Old Bay seasoning instead since I don't have Montreal steak seasoning.  It is a definite must have recipe. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe."
173579,107997,2009-01-22,5,This was fantastic!  Can't go wrong in trying this.  Thanks for posting.
329638,107997,2009-02-24,5,"Oh my goodness, simple and tasty as could be.  DH and I gobbled this down with rice and greenbeans for diner, I dug some french bread out just to sop up the leftover goodies on my plate when it was gone.  Delicious, thanks so much for posting!"
242484,107997,2009-03-29,5,What a hit!  I had some crusty bread and we dipped it in the juices from the shrimp!  I am going to throw some cooked pasta in next time and make it a full meal with those wonderful pan drippings!
928301,107997,2009-07-02,5,This is great!  So much flavor for so little time!  I'll use this recipe again.
4470,107997,2009-07-20,5,"All the reviewshave already said it for this recipe - quick easy & TASTY - Can't improve on something this good thanks Chippie for a recipe that will be repeated over &  over again
25 Jan 09 Made & enjoyed again. Didn't have Montreal steak spice so I used a hot spic mixture Mmmm
19 July 09 This time I used Jumbo Prawns so large that you only needed two per serving. Fabulous - Too bad that the photo really didn't capture how good they were - Great recipe"
60992,107997,2009-08-03,5,"Restaurant quality shrimp! Wow, they really pack a flavor punch. These are so quick to make too. Almost the perfect meal! I removed the tails before cooking, as I am not a fan of pulling them off at the table, but that is a personal preference. Served them over rice pilaf with a generous squeeze of lemon. It was a wonderful meal. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
1365025,107997,2009-09-03,5,"Very tasty! I took the advice of some of the other readers. I used half olive oil and butter, minced roasted garlic, a little red pepper flakes, a little old bay seasoning, and added some chicken. I also used the precooked frozen shrimp.  I served this over rice and yummy was it good."
195589,107997,2010-01-25,5,"Wow! So good and yet so simple. After I removed the shrimp, I made extra sauce, adding a bit more oil, some butter and more lemon juice so we could sop it all up with some crusty sour dough bread. We love garlic, so I didn't leave it in the pan, I put it in with the sauce which I served on the side to dip the bread in. Excellent! Thanks for posting, Chippie."
383346,107997,2013-05-16,5,These shrimps are so yummy.  I cooked plain shrimps for our son and then we cooked these shrimps for me and DH.  We liked them so much.  Montreal steak seasoning is great with the shrimps.  I misread the direction and chopped the garlic so I didn&#039;t have to leave it in the skillet.  DH liked that the garlic was with the shrimps.  The lemon zest and juice was also great in it.  Thanks Chippie :)  Made for Holiday tag game
207176,107997,2014-05-16,5,I had all the ingredients on hand.   I had 2 pans going because they were sort of steaming and I wanted a little browning.  I skipped the parsley.  It was very nice!  Thanks Update- I had a bag of cooked large shrimp. I made al dente pasta and set it aside then added a bit more oil and garlic and followed all but skipped the zest. I added some onion too cause I had it and then I heated the shrimp in the mixture until heated and placed them on the pasta. I added a little cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce and poured it on top. I even took some garlic croutons and crushed them and sprinkled that on top. It was a hit! Thanks
37779,107997,2014-07-19,5,Fabulous fresh flavors with a little heat. Loved it.
218535,107997,2014-12-21,3,I personally liked it. But my hubby and kids won&#039;t eat it.
198154,107997,2017-01-15,4,Faster than drive thru or take out and much better too! I served it with a salad and cheddar biscuits. Next time I may try it over angel hair pasta.
160974,177933,2008-02-28,5,"Heavenly dessert! This was fast to stir together. I didn't have time to let sit for 30 min. but soaked for the time it took my oven to preheat. I ended up not using the whole 2 cups of raisins, about 1 1/2 was enough for my taste.I dusted with a sprinkle of cinnamon upon serving.  This reminded me of two of my favorite desserts: rice pudding and sour cream raisin pie. My father in law was VERY impressed, along with my husband. Thanks for making me look good, Catwhiskers.

55729,46877,2004-01-03,4,"These were really easy, and a great last-minute addition to my cookie trays. I used the red maraschino cherries, and they were quite pretty. With so few ingredients, make sure yours are really fresh - my cookies tasted a bit stale (either the flour or the butter might have been too old)."
59780,46877,2004-01-18,5,"Made exactly as directed, except omitted the cherries, as my husband is not crazy for them. These cookies truly melted in your mouth! Thanks! I'll be making these again soon!"
89831,46877,2004-12-02,5,"Uncle Bill, I wish I could rate these cookies higher than 5 stars, they are simply the best! and when I say simply I mean simply, with only three ingredients you couldn't ask for a better shortbread cookie than these. I used half cake flour and half regular flour. For my second batch I add some mini chocolate chips yummmm! I will never use another shortbread recipe again, so buttery, these things just melt in your mouth! This is a sure thing on my goodie tray for this years Chrismas get together at my home. I am very happy to have found such a wonderful recipe, I will make these again and again! Uncle Bill, Thank you for sharing!....Kitten:) "
47559,46877,2004-12-06,5,"This was the quickest and easiest cookie recipe I ever made, and they tasted fabulous.  DS ate over a dozen within the first hour out of the oven!  "
37305,46877,2005-12-06,5,"Uncle Bill, these are the best (and easiest) cookies I've made this season!  You did make a mistake though...you didn't insist on doubling the recipe!  I am going to make another batch, but they are SO easy, what the heck!  I didn't use cherries, instead I used seedless raspberry jam and I only needed 10 minutes bake time.  Thanks so much for posting this super easy recipe!"
9869,46877,2004-12-20,5,"Delicious melt in your mouth wonderful cookie.
I went all out and used a half a cherry per cookie..lol
Thanks very much for sharing."
40961,46877,2005-08-26,5,"Melt in your mouth delicious flavor. Excellent directions, will be making these little treats often, Thanks for posting:)"
36944,46877,2005-12-19,5,This is an awesome recipe!  Only three ingredients and the taste is so delicate and just melts in your mouth!  They are delicious plain or topped with your favorite treats!  Uncle Bill thanks so much for sharing your delicious recipe and also for your willingness to share your expertise with others!
229850,46877,2006-10-30,5,These were delicious! I followed another reviews hints and coated half of these with choc. How pretty they were. Looked gourmet! Also made and sold at bake sale and they went over very well. Thanx for posting.
55578,46877,2006-12-09,5,"I've never made shortbread cookies before, but these were easy to make and really delicious!"
278113,46877,2006-12-20,5,"WOW..OMG..YUM!
With the first bite, these became my new favorite cookie! They are not too sweet and just melt in your mouth. And to top it off, they could not be any easier to make! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, they will be made and enjoyed often in our home!"
230557,46877,2006-12-22,5,"We loved these cookies and they were given many compliments from people who received them on my holiday cookie trays.  So easy to make, and a wonderful melt in your mouth texture!  Personally I'd like them a little sweeter so will make a few more batches with and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  Thanks very much Uncle Bill!"
394077,46877,2007-04-27,5,"WOW. 10 stars is a must. Melt in your mouth indeed!  I can't stop eating them.  So light and buttery.  I baked them for 14 minutes and they were ready.  Two questions for you uncle Bill,  how do I get the top of the cookies to be golden brown like the bottom ?  And can I use these cookies to make banana pudding in place of the plain old vanilla wafers?  Thanks so much Uncle Bill.  I love your recipes."
371738,46877,2007-06-28,5,"I must join the 100's before me and give these cookies 5 stars, just on the fact that with a handful of ingredients you get such a tasty, melt-in-your-mouth cookie.  I added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and topped them with a 1/4 maraschino cherry pressed into each one after rolling them into small balls.  I am on to my second batch today.  (I rolled them smaller and recipe yielded 48 cookies for me.)  Thank you, Uncle Bill!"
632249,46877,2007-11-08,5,The cookies are delicious but so fragile.  I was breaking them as I put them onto the cooling rack.  I will try again though because they tasted great.
251917,46877,2007-12-07,5,AWESOME! These cookies are melt-in-your-mouth goodness!! I am lucky I still have some for my cookie exchange tomorrow - LOL
359220,46877,2007-12-09,3,"These really do melt in your mouth.  So easy to whip up (literally).  I too was a bit wary when the dough didn't really come together, but kept it mixing and sure enough, a nice dough formed that was easily rollable in small balls and sprinkled with colored sugar.  Mine took 16 minutes to bake, but I did start checking at 10.  Though they were tasty, I felt they were a bit plainer than other shortbreads I've tasted and I did make sure to use a good quality butter.  I think I'll try these again and maybe add some almond or vanilla extract.  Thanks for another winner Uncle Bill!"
91392,46877,2007-12-12,5,"Simple, tasty, quick to do.  I think they need the best quality butter and flour, and I'm glad I used some vanilla and a half candied cherry.  No reason to make more complicated shortbread. Next time I do this I will think about a half pecan on top, or jam would certainly be good but give a completely different cookie.  A real winner for everyone."
8688,46877,2007-12-22,5,"Great Cookies!!  Extremely simple to make with excellent results!  I used a variety to top my cookies of red maraschino cherries, a little red raspberry jam, Sliced almonds and cashew halves. Melt in your mouth delicious! Lovely presentation and a sure winner for any Christmas tray!  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us, Uncle Bill!"
218535,46877,2008-09-09,5,The best Shortbread ever.
138429,46877,2008-12-06,5,These cookies are wonderful. Not much I can say that has not already been said. I used a cookie scope which made them uniform in size and used a glazed cherry on top. Delicious! thanks uncle Bill.
149363,46877,2008-12-17,5,"Great classic shortbread recipe Bill! These were delicious and just melt in your mouth yummy.
I topped mine with some coloured sugar and red and green marachino cherries. Thanks for posting! :)"
140132,46877,2009-03-27,4,Melt in your mouth delicious.  I made these for my family one weekend and they loved them.  I just used red cherries but that didn't matter.  I can't wait to add this to my Christmas platters.  They are so delicate and literally melt in your mouth.  Thank you for posting.
185926,46877,2009-12-06,5,"Buttery and metl-in-your-mouth good.  Soup to nuts, 20 minutes.  From start to when I popped one in my mouth was 20 minutes because I baked mine for 15 minutes.  Thank you."
97579,46877,2009-12-14,4,"These were very good but I now know I prefer a harder shortbread cookie.  They definately melt in your mouth so if you like that type, you will love this recipe!  Thanks!"
126440,46877,2010-02-03,5,"Great Shortbread!  I only made half  and wish I had made the entire recipe.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Wow, what great flavor.  Will be making these often as DH loved them."
173579,46877,2011-01-27,5,Great tasting little cookies.  Very light and airy.  Can't beat a good shortbread cookie.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.
191533,46877,2012-11-26,0,I would like to make these with a mini Hershey's chocolate kiss on each one!
242484,46877,2013-08-12,5,So easy and so good!  My teen son gave it his approval!  I made mine with a thumbprints full of raspberry jam.  One thing I didn&#039;t realize is that these cookies will spread out quite a bit when they cook so make sure and give some room.
894666,46877,2016-03-06,5,"These were to die for, I wanted a shortbread cookie that was easy with no rolling out or cutting or special steps. I made them with no cherries or toppings and we loved the tender butter flavor. Used the vanilla extract and also added just a pinch of salt. May try browning the butter first next time just to see if it makes any kind of a difference, honestly these were 10 stars as is. Perfect with a mug of tea or cocoa!"
315055,46877,2016-12-15,5,"Can't believe I haven't rated these yet, they are my go to shortbread recipe for the best five years! I always do the thumbprint jam ones as pictured and they are delicious. Just remember to press the thumbprint in before cooking or cookies will crumble. =)"
1179225,46877,2018-01-23,5,These turned out so light and delicate. I left out the cherries and added the optional vanilla. I baked one half of the dough recipe plain and the other half I added two bags of chai tea. Both were delicious! Thanks for sharing.
7108,31717,2003-05-18,5,"Very hearty meal, very satisfying meal!  I cooked this on low, for about 7 1/2 hours on low and added the Ditalini pasta for 30 minutes, changed setting to high.  Next time I would cook pasta on stove and add it to soup upon serving, because of thickening of broth.  But the taste was wonderful!  Great recipe and tastes just like the real thing!"
59780,31717,2003-12-14,5,"Great! This is my husband's favourite at the Olive Garden! I did substitute 1 can crushed tomatoes instead of both cans diced tomatoes and I used v8 vegetable juice instead of the spaghetti sauce. Added cooked pasta just before serving. I served my homemade buns recipe#58660 shaped into breadsticks and brushed them with garlic butter for a real ""Olive Garden"" Meal!"
126440,31717,2005-01-04,4,"Made this Sun for dinner.  This is very good.  I used my own spaghetti sauce and cook for about 3 hours on the stove top.  Wonderful, will have left overs tomorrow."
189616,31717,2005-04-25,4,"This was good, nothing fantastic though, the soup was really thick, I ended up adding another can of beef broth, not enough juices for (soup), still adding 1 can still wasn't enough so I'll add a couple more cans tomorrow for leftovers and when I share with my mom-in-law. Used 1-17oz Francesco Rinaldi (puttanesca sauce) for the pasta sauce, perhaps if others used a larger container they would have had a more pronounced flavor and a more 'soupy' consistency.
Thanks for sharing ravensmith!"
145352,31717,2006-01-04,5,Wonderful!!! I did it on the stovetop and let it simmer all day! I also added the small shell pasta after I had precooked it!
168462,31717,2006-01-25,5,"My daughter loved this and said it deserved a 5 star rating. I made this using 1  28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a smaller can of rotel type tomatoes. I also forgot to add the parsley. My pasta took a little longer than the 30 minutes to cook, but I did use a large type. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe."
173579,31717,2006-07-21,5,My family really did like this soup.  Simple to put together.  Will make this again soon.  Thanks for posting.
125640,31717,2006-11-07,4,"Very good soup and very easy to make. I halved everything except for the meat and the white beans and this made a ton of food (filled my crockpot to the top and the 2 of us barely made a dent in it) so I would bet the full recipe feeds far more than 8. The only changes I made was to use 1/2 Italian sausage (I used hot; the extra flavor was nice, but a little too hot, so I'll use mild next time) and I sauteed the onion with the meat. Served this with garlic bread. Very nice. Thanks."
232480,31717,2006-12-11,4,"This was very, very good.  I halved the recipe and am glad I did because it made a TON.  I followed the recipe (except for the halving) to the letter and wasn't disappointed.  The only question I wasn't sure about was what size jar of spaghetti sauce, as it wasn't specified.  I used a 26 oz. jar and then cut it in half to match the proportions in the rest of the recipe.  I doubt I'll make this again as DH says he doesn't like pasta fagioli, which I didn't know - but I thought it was good."
307214,31717,2006-12-12,4,Very but I ran out of room in my crockpot!  So I omitted the spaghetti sauce and pasta!  Next time I will halve the recipe and it will all fit in!
222970,31717,2007-01-01,5,"This one has gone into my permanent keepers file! Very good; quite healthy. The only thing I would change is the servings from 6 to 10-12, which changes the nutrition information slightly! I also tend to use some good msg-free bouillon cubes rather than canned stock (storage space issue), which works just fine."
38643,31717,2007-03-02,5,Great recipe for those cold and wet days. I will be making this again.
439797,31717,2007-05-14,4,Good.  I made it on the stovetop and it really filled up the pan.
358796,31717,2007-08-28,4,"I used only 1 lb. of beef, 4 oz. of whole wheat rigatoni pasta, a jar of chopped roasted red peppers and left out the celery. Very good soup! I have never tried Olive Gardens so can't compare it to that, but it was quite tasty. Makes a ton! Note: I cooked on high 3 1/2 hours, and it was fine. The carrots were a little firm still, so you may want to dice those small if you are going to shorten the time."
177933,31717,2007-12-19,5,"Wonderful!  I halved the recipe for just 4 adults.  I used Recipe #266734 for the spaghetti sauce.  I ended up adding 2 cans of beef consume and it worked out great!  I aslo added 2 tsp of vinegar and about a tbl of worcestershire.  I seasoned as I went along with extra pepper and garlic salt.  Oh, and what I think made it really special was using little cheese filled tortalinis for the pasta - delish!  I cooked the soup in my crockpot for 5 hours on high.  The veggies were perfect.  Cooked the pasta separately and added to the bowls.  I made Recipe #104628 to go with it and it was a perfect combo!  Thanks, will definately make again."
37036,31717,2008-01-08,5,"My family really loved this soup.  I made it one day, placed it in the refrigerator that night and served it two days later.  The flavor was wonderful.  The only change I made was that I omitted the diced tomatoes because my father was coming for dinner and he doesn't like chunks of tomato in his soup.  It was delicious without them, but I do like tomato so next time I will be adding them.  I served this with garlic bread and it made a very filling meal.  Thank you Ravensmith for a great recipe!"
229850,31717,2008-01-29,5,"This was very good, and makes enough for later freezing and using. I made this in two individual soup pots. One I finished so we could eat and the other I left out the tomatoes and the pasta to freeze and use later. Very tasty and very easy. Thanks for posting"
262312,31717,2008-07-10,5,great crockpot recipe!  i halved the recipe (which was perfect for 3 BIG eaters) and used stew meat instead of ground beef.  i can't wait to have it with ground beef because i think it would be better with little bits of meat running all through the soup.  thanks for a great recipe!
489552,31717,2008-02-01,5,"I did this awhile back.  Sorry about getting to review it a little late.  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  This was so easy to put together, we had two servings and we had leftovers for work, that is how good this was.  A must try for those who haven't already done so, you'll love it!
Thank you for a great soup recipe for a cold day here in Canada :)"
60989,31717,2008-02-18,5,"Absolutely delish! A very easy, and filling meal. Smells heavenly while cooking, and the leftovers are just as good. Thanks!"
666723,31717,2008-03-31,3,"This was bland for me!  I can't say it was horrible, as we ate it for dinner with no complaints, but it just didn't do it for us.  If I had it to do over, I'd use some italian sausage instead of the ground beef and double up on the herbs.  Also it seemed like all I tasted was the carrots.  I've never tried this soup at the olive garden, but I've tried their others and really was hoping for more.  I thought it seemed like a ton of food so I halved the recipe and even then it was just a ton of food, almost coming to the top of my large crock pot.  So so sorry but we won't be making this again!"
808027,31717,2008-06-10,5,This is awesome.  It will be a regular in our rotation.  I made it on the stovetop instead of the crockpot and it turned out fine.
914720,31717,2008-11-24,5,"DS said this should be 6 stars - he even had seconds, which is unheard of.  DH also gave it 5 stars.  The only change I made was to use celery seeds instead of celery.  Due to time constraints, it cooked for 4 hours on high, which left the carrots and onions a bit underdone.  Next time, I'll let it cook for 8 hours on low.  Thanks for sharing!"
74281,31717,2008-12-01,4,"This was pretty easy to throw together and very good. I had to make a couple of changes based on my family's tastes... onion powder instead of onion, no celery and i substituted 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes for one can of diced."
222433,31717,2009-03-20,5,Yummy soup! The only thing I did different was to cook the pasta separately and add it in. Definite make again!!
1179225,31717,2009-08-31,5,This was excellent! Loved by all. Looking forward to making this again. Thank you for posting!
37779,31717,2009-09-17,4,"This was a nice, hearty, filling soup. Based on other reviews, I cooked the pasta and added at the very last. Makes a lot, so I will freeze leftovers and use later. Thanks"
203325,31717,2009-09-26,5,This soup was awesome.  It was really easy to put together before work.  We came home to a yummy dinner.
175824,31717,2011-12-16,5,"This does make a lot. It just fit in my crock pot. I never tasted Olive Garden's. I did freeze half of the batch. Next time, I will add the pasta separately. The pasta got soggy after it was frozen and thawed, otherwise it was delicious. I followed the recipe. Thanks ravensmith for sharing"
1133190,31717,2010-12-12,5,"This was very good. I've never had Olive Gardens version so I can't compare.  This recipe does make a lot of soup, it barely fit into my crockpot!  I think next time I would halve the recipe as there is just two of us.  I only used 1 lb of hamburger and I felt it was plenty, honestly I think 2 lbs would be too much."
140132,31717,2011-01-14,3,"We had a busy night planned with running with the kids so I opted for this recipe so it would be ready for when we all got home.  I started this at 10:00 am and we were ready to eat at 8:00pm, and while it was ok the carrots and celery were still crunchy.  DS liked it more then the rest of us, I hate to be the ""odd man out"" but we just didn't care for this."
369715,31717,2011-01-19,5,I loved this. I followed the recipe other then I didn't add the celery as I didn't have any. I also used black beans and northern beans as that is all I had on hand. I added the optional tabasco sauce. I topped mine with parm cheese. This was so good. Great flavor.
226863,31717,2011-08-09,5,"I came home from work for lunch and threw this in the crockpot, and came home to a delicious soup.  It's been quite a while since I ate at Olive Garden, but I do remember this soup, and it is very close.  This is a very hearty, filling soup.  I will enjoy making this in the winter when it is cold!  I added the pasta in the bowl, as many of the other reviewers did.  Thanks for sharing!"
532289,31717,2011-10-04,4,Made as directed.  It was pretty good.  I served it with Norma's Quick Rolls #237823 and used  Kttencals-italian-tomato-pasta-sauce-and-parmesan-meatballs-71273 (without the meatballs) for the spaghetti sauce.  I only made half a recipe and it filled my crock pot.  I imagine as with most soups this will only get better in the fridge to eat tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing.
2041603,31717,2011-10-26,4,"This is pretty good. Makes a whole crockpot full. I made my own spaghetti sauce and altered the amount of carrot, onion and celery. I've never had it from Olive Garden, so I cannot say how it compares."
39835,31717,2011-11-05,5,"Wonderful and easy! I did need to cut the recipe down a bit to fit in my crockpot by using only 1 pound ground beef, 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks, and half the amount of tomatoes -- otherwise kept the remainder of ingredients and it came out wonderful! Thanks for sharing!"
178742,31717,2012-02-14,5,"Update ~ Feb 14, 2012. Made it again for Valentines Day dinner! Again, made it on stovetop, simmering soup for about 2, 2 1/2  hours. Added pasta (elbow), al dente, about the last 1/2 hour. It was a big hit again. Family came over to eat. Served it with cornbread. Oh, one last thing, When my meat was almost done browning, I added all my veggies and seasonings to the meat until the meat was done. Drained and transfer all to my deep pot, added the rest of the ingredients (except pasta), tomatoes, broth, tomatoe sauce. <br/>Wow!! This was soooooo good! I made the Pasta E Fagioli Soup today. It was all on ths stove ready to go at 3pm, and we were eating by 530pm. My husband and I each had 2 bowls! I followed the recipe exactly, and took the suggestions of others and cooked my pasta (elbow macaroni) on stove top, then put in with the soup right before serving. I seasoned my ground beef with seasoning salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then used the seasoings in the recipe ingredients. This Soup was fantastic! I've never had soup with pasta. We loved it and will serve again. I served with multi-grain french bread! <br/>Thank you for sharing!!"
632249,31717,2012-07-23,5,"Marvelous!  I cooked this on the stovetop as there was no way my little crockpot could hold all of it.  I chose not to add the pasta as we are watching our carbs but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The next time I make this I will add a bit of garlic because we love garlic.  I have never eaten at Olive Garden so I can't say whether it tastes like their soup, but who cares?  This stuff is great!  Thanks for sharing this recipe."
191533,31717,2013-12-03,5,"Very good! I made half the recipe, and it definitely was 2 meals for hubby and me. I agree that there is not enough liquid. I added 3 more cups beef broth at the end. Before I did that, the flavor was excellent but it was stew. Adding liquid gave the right consistency, but I lost a little flavor. I will make this again, with a little experimentation!"
482376,31717,2014-01-18,5,"This was great soup and so easy to throw together. It had great flavor! I used 1 1/4 lbs of ground turkey and it still worked out beautifully. Other than that, I kept the recipe the same. Yummy!"
38643,49200,2003-03-08,5,Five stars for these potatoes.What a perfect combination of spices. I served these with salmon patties and they were a big hit. Will be making them often. Thanks Dana.
4470,49200,2003-03-10,5,What a treat!  I used freshly grated real Italian parmesan  and fresh minced garlicans did them on a baking stone - Wonderful Dana  Thank-you
29014,49200,2003-03-10,5,We loved these and will definitely be making again!  So easy and with such great flavor - I am also going to use the oil and spice mixture on grilled veggies this summer - can't wait!  Didn't need to change anything about this great recipe!
60992,49200,2003-03-11,5,"Incredible! These are so easy and tasty! I added some season salt and a wee bit of rosemary to the mix! Super! The family justed ""MMM""ed in unison as they ate these! Another Dana dish that will be served often in our home! Thanks Dana!"
26512,49200,2003-03-11,5,"These were very good! I made these to go along with your Sloppy Joes and it was a great combo!
It only took about 30 minutes for mine to cook because I cut them in smaller wedges. I also salted them right after removing from the oven.
I served these with sour cream and chive dip and loved the tang of the spices and the creamy cool dip. Thanks for another keeper, this one is alterable, easy and very tasty!"
47559,49200,2003-03-23,5,"Easy, colorful, and delicious.  Didn't change a thing.  I'll make these again.  "
28649,49200,2003-03-24,5,These are great.  They are easy to make.  These are something I will make again and again.  Thank you Dana for a great recipe.
13483,49200,2003-05-14,5,"Not much I can say that has not been said!!  These are just good!!  I put everything into a plastic bag, shook it up and made sure all spuds were coated then baked as directed.  Easy and better than fries!!"
52125,49200,2003-08-29,4,"These were quick and easy to fix, and tasted wonderful!! Thanks.."
37779,49200,2004-05-10,5,"Dana, these potato wedges were the highlight of our family dinner. I doubled the recipe and I am very glad I did. The proportion and blend of spices was just right. I always love it when something is this easy to make and my family digs it. Thanks a bunch. :)"
142464,49200,2004-05-25,5,"So simple.  So easy.  And so darn good!!!  Had these on the weekend instead of the usual french fries. Instead of brushing the ingredients on the potatoes I put everything in a Ziploc bag and tossed them around until well coated and they turned out perfect.
Will definitely be making these again.  Thanks, Dana-MMH."
168462,49200,2005-03-04,5,These were very popular in my house. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.
173579,49200,2005-03-07,5,These are very good potatoes.  My whole family really emjoyed them.  They were nicely seasoned.  Thanks for posting.
140806,49200,2006-08-26,4,These are great wedges. DH made way too many so we froze them for later. It seems like this recipe might be missing a little something...I just can't place my finger on it.
50969,49200,2006-08-27,4,"My SO and I tried these,and we found them to be very good.I mixed the coating ingredients in a plastic zipper bag,added the potatoes,and ""swished"" them around.To me it seemed liked the potatoes were more evenly coated this way.(and two less items to wash:))Placed them on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil.There was only one small problem,they didn't get as crispy as we would have liked,but,that's only a minor thing.This will be made again,Thank you for posting."
362983,49200,2006-12-15,5,"I don't know why we bought all those prepackaged wedges when this was so quick and easy! I used chili powder instead of paprika and less oil in general. There was too much salt for my liking (and I like salty potatoes!) - I'd cut the amount in half next time. Other than that, these were great. Also, cut your potatoes really thin if you want really crispy wedges! Yummy!"
307214,49200,2007-01-20,5,Excellent.  The potatoes were very crunchie ... a fault with the cook not the recipe (used smaller potato chunks instead of wedges and didn't decrease cooking time)  Served this with fish.
402559,49200,2007-08-20,5,"I sprinkled some ranch dressing mix over these as well and they came out great, crispy on the outside soft on the inside with a ton of flavor. Thanks!"
185446,49200,2007-11-03,2,"With 108 mostly glowing reviews, I had to try these.  Was disappointed--seemed rather greasy and not very crisp. The paprika seemed to overpower the other added spices.  Sorry to not share in everyone else's enthusiasm."
175824,49200,2007-11-09,5,Oh my were these good not to mention how easy they were.I used olive oil instead of regular oil. I used garlic salt instead of powder because that is what I had. I omitted the salt. They came out perfect. They were delicious and crunchy. Thanks for sharing
140132,49200,2007-12-12,4,really good
229524,49200,2008-01-06,5,Good and easy. No reason to buy frozen when you can have such tasty Wedges like these.  Did cook my at 400 as suggested by some other reviewers and they came out nice and crunchy.
53932,49200,2008-02-03,5,These were very good!  I did add extra garlic powder and pepper to mine and also added some more salt upon serving.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes and 425 for the remaining 20 for extra crispness.
355637,49200,2008-02-22,3,"These were just okay to me. Made them exactly as said, but didn't really see anything wonderful."
218535,49200,2008-03-03,1,Agree with MaddieLC. These were OK but nothing special.
844554,49200,2008-12-03,5,"These were very good! I cut the wedges into halves, mixed everything in a bowl and baked them. Will make again. Thanks."
386849,49200,2009-01-08,4,"Really good, and really easy.  Thanks!"
103876,49200,2009-01-31,5,Very good potatoes.  Turned out crisp and flavorful.  I used a bit less oil and they were still good.  Thanks for posting!
91392,49200,2009-10-15,3,"Not what I was expecting.  Great taste, but I didn't care for the consistency of the final product.  Easy to do though, try it and see if you like it."
357358,49200,2009-11-29,5,"Everyone, even the picky eaters, agreed these were delicious. No more boring baked potatoes if I have an hour to bake these. Thanks Dana!"
15521,49200,2012-03-01,5,My husband loves baked potato wedges and these were just his thing.  We loved the spices and they went together easily.  Thanks for sharing!
928301,49200,2012-06-21,4,"seasonings were good, but overall the potatoes weren't raveable to me.  They were easy yes, but I like crispiness & I didn't get any crunch at all with these.<br/><br/>On second try, I cut them thinner and was more happy with the result"
894666,49200,2016-03-18,5,"Loved how easy these came together, was worried it would be too much paprika but turned out wonderful! Will make again!"
142559,185342,2007-05-23,5,YUM!!!  This was incredibly easy and oh so tasty! I omitted the pepper just because of preference. I used 1 boneless skinless chicken breast and adjusted the ingredients - put it all in a ziploc bag and shook it. Came out so tender and juicy. Thanks for posting! :)
18391,185342,2007-10-07,4,I like this more than my husband did..He thought it was somewhat bland so next time I might just fry his. Also want to add some salt. Thanks!
383346,185342,2008-01-14,5,I used 1 pound of chicken tenders.  Maybe it was too much for the quantity of breadcrumbs mixture.  But the taste was yummy!  And the chicken was tender.  Thanks Lainey :) Made for Zaar Star Game
199792,185342,2008-01-21,5,"These are absolutely wonderful, so tender and moist. I just threw all the seasonings (including Italian seasoning) and cheese into the food processor with a slice of bread. I was surprised at the nice crispy breading even without an egg bath. This will be our go-to chicken recipe mid-week or company. Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe."
280271,185342,2008-03-14,5,I have to give this a 5 star rating. I found that it was full of flavor. It was nice and moist plus it was tender. I did toss it around in the bag with all the coating mixture. Saved a plate...:) This will be made again. Easy dish to prepare on a work night. Thanks Laniey6605 for posting.
203111,185342,2008-07-21,5,"Oh WOW, I love this!  I've had it twice now in the past couple of days...can't seem to get enough of it.  LOL!  I scaled the recipe to 1 serving.  And because it seemed a little rich for my taste, the 2nd time I made it, I added a little whole wheat flour to the breading and that made it perfect.  Baked in my tiny toaster oven for about 30 min. and it was so tender and juicy. Yum!  I'm getting hungry just talking about it."
88099,185342,2008-11-07,5,"This was excellent.  I used this to put on top of recipe #294654 for a complete one plate meal.  The two went so well together.  For rating purposes, I tried this recipe separate from the other and we loved it.  I cut my chicken into strips and then doubled the breading because there were more pieces to cover.  Because we like a little spice, I used 1/2 paprika and 1/2 cayenne pepper to give it a little zip.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks Lainey"
369715,185342,2008-11-18,5,Very good and easy to make. Followd the recipe exactly as written and everyone enjoyed them.
470351,185342,2008-11-24,4,"Wow!  Nice and tasty, super easy.  What more could I want?  I cooked my ultra thin chicken breasts about 18 minutes and upped the spices a bit.  Used italian breadcrums.  Delicious and healthy.  Gotta love that.  Will definitely make this one again.  Nice and moist!"
55578,185342,2009-06-14,5,"Great recipe, great flavor and I love that it's low cal."
439797,185342,2009-08-26,5,Yummy.  Made it exactly as written.  Next time I'll double it because we ate every bite!  Delicious.
80998,185342,2010-01-03,5,I made a bunch of these for lunches this week.  I am putting them on salads.  That is way I chose to use chicken strips instead of breasts.   I ended up with a very tasty lunch.  I put italian dressing on the salad before topping with two strips of chicken.  Thanks.
46660,185342,2010-01-10,5,"Fabulous! I made it exactly as directed. I had sprayed the bottom of the pan with nonstick spray and I think that made them a little soggy on the bottom, but that's my fault. The chicken was very nicely seasoned. I will definitely make this again!"
26512,185342,2010-01-14,4,"Very good. I used onion powder instead of the garlic powder and also added a bit of salt and oregano. I gave the chicken a shot of olive oil Pam before baking. Crispy and juicy, will make again. Thanks for the recipe."
124190,185342,2010-01-14,4,"This is a good recipe that we enjoyed. Everyone ate it, which is nice. DH felt there could have been a bit more breading, but it IS a WW recipe after all. :) Thanks for a recipe we will make again."
844554,185342,2010-01-15,5,I cut the recipe down to 1 big chicken breast and brined my chicken first for a couple of hours. I loved the seasonings on this chicken. Very tasty. Will make this again and again!
187373,185342,2010-02-07,4,"Pretty bland chicken, but think it could be better with more seasoning.  As is, had barely any taste.  I cut up the chicken into smaller pieces.  Might make again with adding more spices."
407007,185342,2010-04-02,5,"This is one yummy chicken recipe! I used panko italian breadcrumbs and whirled them with the parmesan cheese in the food processor so they would have the same consistency. I also sprayed the tops of the chicken with cooking spray to give them a golden crust and help the crumbs stick a little better. This was so easy and definitely a keeper! I served with Recipe #358209, for a perfect healthy meal. Thanks for sharing!"
91392,185342,2011-01-07,4,"Good, easy, fast healthy.  Needs a bit more spice for our tastes though."
131021,185342,2011-06-14,5,"I cut this into a cutlet and cooked it on the stove in a nonstick pan without any oil. It was good and cooked in just a few minutes. I'm making these tomorrow for dinner and I think I will follow the suggestion to put a little oil or mayo on the chicken so it holds some more of the crumb mixture, as I like mine a little thicker. Overall it was good, fast and good for you. Yum."
632249,185342,2012-01-09,5,"My house smelled so good while this was cooking, ummmmmm.  I followed the recipe exactly and we loved it.  I didn't have trouble with the coating sticking at all. I did have to bake for about 35-40 minutes as the breasts were quite large. This will definitely be made again and again.  Thank you."
1179225,185342,2012-01-20,5,"Why would you make chicken parmesan any other way? This chicken was so juicy, tender and perfectly seasoned. I pounded the chicken, and smeared it lighlty with low fat mayo just to keep the breading on. It came out perfect. I'll be making this again. Thanks for posting."
140132,185342,2012-01-28,5,I made this last night for dinner and we loved it.  The parmesan is so flavorful when baked....yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 22 minutes.  The dish came out perfect.  thank you for sharing this great recipe with us.
461834,185342,2012-02-17,5,"Well I didn't realize how popular this recipe is, until I tagged it in PRMR Tag Game and went to review it!!!!  I made this for my lunch, so scaled it back for one.  I wasn't serving this with pasta, so I did add some marinara sauce and then topped it with some mozzarella, which I know would up the points/calories, but it was so good.  I too, used fresh shredded parmesan in place of the grated Kraft kind.  I had this with some carrot sticks, as I knew I was also going to meet my DS at the movie theater and knew I would be eating buttered popcorn and this would help keep my calories to where they should be.  Thanks for sharing a great lo-cal recipe Lainey!!!"
15521,185342,2013-01-22,5,Very good and easy.  We all enjoyed this flavorful and moist chicken.
368078,185342,2013-04-23,4,very good.  rubbed a very little amount of mayo on it before dipping.  The only thing we thought it needed was a little salt.  Will make again!
486718,185342,2014-05-20,5,We really enjoyed this one! I added panko to give an extra crunch to the the chicken.  These came out so juicy and flavorful.  Thanks!!!
37779,39087,2002-10-11,5,"Scrumpdillyumptious!!! We love alfredo but this spicier version was so good, our eyes were rolling in the back of our heads. I made no addtions or substitutions and your recipe as written is perfect for our tastes. The sauce was so rich and creamy. I agree with Shae, that we might try it with shrimp next time. Thanks Lorac, for a true delight."
4470,83561,2004-03-24,5,"5 star all the way.  As others I used skinless boneless breasts, put lots of parmesan/bread crumbs on well buttered/garlic breasts.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes, moist juicy and very tasty. Served with wholewheat lightly buttered Spaghitti pasta,steamed broccoli and Belgium Endive salad- Excellent"
117565,83561,2004-03-26,5,"WOW, this will become a staple in our house!!!  The kids have got me to make this every time we have chicken breast.  I cook for our youth group when we go to Mexico on a Mission and this will be one of the dishes I will make this year I have 120 teenagers to cook for and I know they will love this one.  Thank you so much for this recipe."
59780,83561,2004-04-16,5,Great recipe! I made this using chicken leg quarters and the results were great! The chicken was really moist and had good flavour. I did find that I had to bake it almost 20 minutes longer than directed. I served this with crockpot baked potatoes with Baked Potato topping recipe#63887 and Broccoli salad recipe#85157.
64934,83561,2004-04-19,5,"This chicken was delicious, and it the aroma of it cooking was wonderful!  I used chicken thighs to make this and they came out juicy and tender.   I didn't have any fresh parsley, so I had to sub dry parsley.  I cooked the thighs for 60 minutes as stated.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!"
26512,83561,2004-05-17,5,"Excellent chicken! I used boneless breasts and I added a *lot* more garlic. It's a very rich dish, I couldn't even finish my dinner! I served with plain pasta and butter tossed with fresh parsley and chives with parmesan. Very, very good recipe and I will definitely make this again."
121185,83561,2004-05-22,3,Hmmm...Not my favorite.  I'm a huge garlic fan (so is the rest of the family) but not one person really liked this dish.  It smelled great while cooking - oh well!
44383,83561,2004-06-13,4,"Pretty good!  We used chicken wings and DH, who usually makes ""his wings"" said these were almost as good.  So thumbs up on this chicken recipe.  "
146486,83561,2004-06-17,5,I made this for my BF and we both loved it.  Thanks this is a keeper!
47907,83561,2004-10-26,5,I made this last night ~ excellent!  Very simple but very tasty.  The chicken stayed moist.  I made the recipe exactly as is and wouldn't change a thing.  I baked in a casserole dish instead of a flat pan.
60992,83561,2004-11-09,5,"This is SO good! I used boneless skinless breasts and cut the baking time to about 40 minutes. The ONLY chnage I would do is use the cheese from the cannister (horrors!)as the other grated cheese did not incorporate the best, but the flavor was fab. This is a wonderfully decadent weeknight dinner and I highly recommend this!"
54678,83561,2004-11-12,5,"Anything with garlic is tops in our eating habits. Juicy, garlicky and yummmmmy!"
229524,83561,2006-07-23,5,This recipe deserves 10 STARS!!!  This was soooooo good and so easy to make.  I can't wait to share this terrific recipe with my friends.  Thanks SilentCricket for sharing this :)
55729,83561,2006-05-06,5,"I didn't change a thing on this recipe - the flavor is dynamite! I did end up burning my bread crumbs a bit, but that is entirely my fault. (I left it in the oven past 1 hour, because the chicken still had a few ice crystals when I put it in.) This is like a glorified Shake N Bake, only 1000 times tastier!"
278113,83561,2006-07-30,5,"YUM!!All of us (including both children) loved this recipe! I used boneless chicken tenders, and cooked them for 25 mins. They were so moist and delicious! This is going to be a regular here for us from now on..thanks for sharing this great recipe!!"
92886,83561,2007-01-15,4,"I made this for my mother's retirement party.  It was eaten all up!  I did find it necessary to run it under the broiler to crisp  up the coating.  I used boneless, skinless breats, so I did not need to cook for the whole hour."
316717,83561,2007-03-09,5,i halfed the recipe since i only had 1 lb of thin sliced chicken breasts. they turned out wonderful and so easy.  next time i'll add more garlic since i'm a huge garlic lover. thanks for sharing!
207176,83561,2007-04-08,3,"I personally would have given this a 5 but for some reason, the family didn't like it that much."
329638,83561,2007-07-23,5,"Vey yummy!  I made a few adjustments- used chicken breasts, removed the skin and spritzed with a butter-flavored spray,  Then mixed 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder in with the breadcrumbs mixture, coated the breasts with it, then patted on a little more and spritzed with the butter spray again.  The chicken was really moist, the topping was crisp, and had a great flavor.  We didn't miss the skin!  I served this with fresh corn on the cob, garden tomatoes, mashed potatoes and low-fat gravy for a great homey meal. What a great recipe- thanks for posting!"
55578,83561,2007-07-27,5,Awesome! I too used chicken tenders.  I only wish SilentCricket was here to see how much we appreciate her recipes.
9869,83561,2007-09-25,5,"This was great, easy to make and the taste was great. Will be making this again."
265954,83561,2008-01-17,5,"Three cheers for this recipe.  I made 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Here is how I did it:  I halved the entire recipe and, for the garlic, I used 1 Tbsp. of crushed garlic out of a jar.  Also, I heated the garlic and butter for 40 seconds in the microwave, instead of heating it on the stove top.  I did not brush the garlic butter onto the chicken, but dipped the chicken on both sides in the butter and then dredged in the breadcrumb mixture.  I topped the chicken with the remaining mixed butter and breadcrumbs, which did not crumble onto the chicken but moreso plopped onto the chicken.  I would NOT recommend adding the remaining breadcrumbs to the chicken, b/c it was overkill and my hubby and I ended up scraping the extra breadcrumbs off the finished chicken.  I would, however, add the remaining garlic butter.  I baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  What a tender, tender chicken this produces, cooked just right.  This is a wonderful recipe that I would highly recommend."
632249,83561,2008-01-25,5,Just delicious!
185285,83561,2008-02-13,5,"Great basic recipe that gives crunchy-on-the-outside and tender-on-the-inside chicken! I used what I had on hand: chicken breasts with panko breadcrumbs,dried parsley and a veggie-sub parmesan cheese which worked very well."
142367,83561,2008-03-27,4,This recipe is a keeper -- it is very easy to put together.  Any leftovers make great chicken sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing.
331557,83561,2008-04-09,5,This was easy and tasty!  I cut the recipe in half but still doubled the original amount of garlic for additonal garlic flavour.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into larger pieces and dumped them into the butter and garlic mixture and then dumped the breadcrumbs mixture into the same pot and stirred.  It only took about 45 minutes to cook and there were lots of crispy bits.  If I had cooked it for the full hour I think it would have burned.  We will definitely have this again.  Thanks for posting!
140132,83561,2008-06-25,5,"We really liked this chicken.  It cooked up so beautiful.  I will be making this often.  My family and I really like the ""crunch"" it made.  Thank you for posting."
187373,83561,2009-09-18,4,"Great recipe! Used homemade breadcrumbs and boneless, skinless chicken breast. Thanks for posting!"
218535,83561,2008-12-01,5,"This was delicious. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs."
470351,83561,2008-12-17,5,"TRUE 5 Stars here!!!!  I'm always looking for the ""healthier"" version to food and love that I can have ""fried"" chicken in the oven rather than in oil!  My waistline thanks you!  I, of course, used boneless skinless chicken breasts rather than skin on chicken pieces.  Still was fabulous.  I only used about 1 pound of chicken breast fillets and decreased the butter and crumbs a bit but added extra garlic and kept the parmesan the same.  We adored this one!"
847160,83561,2009-01-22,4,My girl made ...it was good
844554,83561,2009-02-10,4,I loved the way it smelled and looked. It was very tasty and going into the keeper file. Thanks.
29782,83561,2009-08-17,4,"The aroma of this baking was wonderful. Went very well with recipe#302197 and recipe#299919
Thanks for sharing!"
482376,83561,2014-01-11,5,Excellent flavor and crunch. I used about half the amount of parmesan cheese (because I ran out!) and cooked chicken legs for about 45 minutes vs 60 minutes. The chicken was delicious. The garlic flavor hit just the right notes. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I highly recommend this recipe. Thank you!
60992,39087,2003-05-10,5,"SPECTACULAR!!! This blend of spicy, creamy, pasta, veg and chicken is heaven on your plate. Everything melds together perfectly! Best of all the directions are easy to follow and it cooks up in no time flat. For an impressive meal that is good enough for company and quick as well, this is the ticket! I want to make this again VERY soon. I may try to sub the chicken with shrimp and add a splash of white wine, but it is absolute perfection as is, so who knows? Why mess with a great recipe!"
59163,39087,2003-09-02,5,"Have made this twice now.  We just love it.  Easy to prepare, the only drawback, it's not for dieters. So will only make once in a while. Would be a great dish for dinner guests.  I make a little more and my husband takes the leftovers in his lunch."
68884,39087,2004-02-16,5,"Yum!! DH LOVED this, for Valentine's Day. I did add mushrooms, like someone else suggested, and I added a green bell pepper too. I only used one chicken breast -- it just seemed like a lot. I think this recipe makes more than 2 servings -- Just using one chicken breast, we had leftovers and DH had 2 servings.
Also, I added some red pepper and made it really hot, and I used a garlic clove instead of the powder.
Definitely will make again."
68960,39087,2004-03-12,5,"This is excellent and has become one of my favourites, so very easy to make.  The flavour is outstanding.  Thanks Carol for another fantastic recipe which will be regular in our house."
47559,39087,2004-03-13,5,"Wow, this is one of those rare recipe treasures that will be a new family favorite. Everyone at the table ate with enthusiasm and asked for more than there was!  You just couldn't get enough of the fabulous taste.  DH said: ""If this is one of those ratable recipes - give it six stars!"" - and he's not a pasta fan!  I used a pound of shrimp instead of the chicken, used fresh basil and garlic, and subbed fire roasted yellow and red peppers for the sun-dried tomatoes (it's what I had in the pantry) and doubled the pasta and sauce ingredients.  I didn't have heavy cream, so I used the Land of Lakes fat free half and half.  I added just a tsp of cornstarch and let it boil gently a few minutes to thicken it up with the Parmesan which worked out beautifully.  My cajun seasoning mix is very spicy - I used 4 tsp for the pound of shrimp, and it was perfect for our tastes. All this raving, and I haven't even mentioned how easy it all was - thanks so much for sharing this recipe."
146486,39087,2004-08-19,5,I doubled this recipe and am so glad I did.  Had some left over and it was just as good the next day.  I used too much cream but I just added some corn starch to thicken it up.  Will be making this again soon!
18391,39087,2004-10-03,5,"Excellent! And so simple to make too! My husband loved it! I did use only half the amount of cheese called for, and about 3/4 cup of cream .. thank you for posting this!"
169969,39087,2005-01-07,5,This was sooooo GOOD! The sauce was so yummy I couldn't stop tasting it. I used ChrisMc's Cajun Seasoning (33092) when I realized I did not have prepared cajun seasoning. It made the perfect amount. This was so quick and easy! I added peas as suggested...but the dish really does not need any extra ingredients - it can stand on its own. I used 2 cups of heavy cream and 8 ounces of pasta. I was going to post a photo but Dannygirl's photo was much prettier. Thank you so much!
176615,39087,2005-01-07,5,"Fabulous! I used 1 cup whipping cream, sun-dried tomatoes in oil, otherwise as stated in the recipe. Very tasty, easy and quick. Spicy, but not overly so, though this would depend on your cajun seasoning. Would be really good with crawfish or shrimp as well. Thanks, Lorac, for a wonderful dinner!"
55729,39087,2005-03-07,4,"I thought this was very good! I only got to eat the chicken with no noodles, so my sauce was a bit runny since it isn't meant for that. I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of cream. I also got a couple of complaints about throats burning (even though I didn't think it was spicy). Next time I will double again, but use 1 c. cream and just serve as a chicken dish - maybe not double the cajun seasoning."
158086,39087,2005-04-07,5,Add me to the list of lovers of this recipe...i used half and half instead of whip cream and it was still rich and wonderful...
173314,39087,2005-04-20,5,Great taste and easy to prepare. I would use only 1 cup cream and give time to thicken and double cajun....was so yummy and will make on a regular basis!
59780,39087,2005-05-29,0,"---posted Jun 12, 2003Thank you for this great recipe! This tastes like something you would eat at a restaurant! I left out the chicken, as I used this as a side dish. My husband and our exchange student thought this was a perfect addition to our meal--there were no leftovers!! I also added some green peppers which added a nice flavour. Thanks for this recipe! **update I made this today as directed and this was truly an amazing dish! Even the kids had seconds, and it was an easy meal to put together in a very short time. Thanks for posting it! "
50969,39087,2005-07-13,5,"hooweeeee!!!!!!!!! it started out smooth and creamy and then it came on with a hint of heat,next the flavors just burst in your mouth. for the cajun seasoning i used chef ChisMc's recipe#33092.this is definitly going to be a repeat at our home.thank you so much for posting."
13796,39087,2006-03-09,5,"Ok.. Ok.. so I CHEATED.. Shoot me! I was in a hurry. I used a jar of alfredo sauce with one cup of spaghetti sauce mixed in. I omitted the parmesan except for sprinkling on the finished dish. I used fresh basil,too and a bit of green pepper.  It was delicious. Even though I changed the recipe a bit... I still appreciate the inspiration for the dish, Lorac. Oh baby... it was good! I still used all of the other ingredients. I was in heaven. I served it over angel hair pasta.
I think next time I might add a couple tablespoons of vodka. ..  :-)
Thanks Lorac!"
188119,39087,2006-10-20,5,Very easy and good too!  I used half and half instead of whipping cream and I had to omit sun dried tomatoes since I didn't have any on hand.  It was still good though.  Thanks!
251917,39087,2006-10-23,5,This was easy to make and delicious too! I made it for Sweetest Day for myself and my husband and it was a hit! Thank you for posting it!
359220,39087,2006-11-05,5,This pasta is sooo good!  I added 2 cups of cream and then 1tbs cornstarch mixed with 1tbs water to thicken it up a bit.  I'll try this recipe with variations too!
180090,39087,2007-01-28,5,"I made this for me and my Mom tonight and it was awesome!!! My Mom said that it was restaurant quality and I totally agree. I made the recipe exactly as posted, but used about 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream. It was very creamy and had a great flavor, slightly spicy. This made enough for me and my Mom and we had some leftover chicken that we will use for salads. Next time, I will add more pasta (and more whipping cream to compensate) and more sun-dried tomatoes. I will be making this meal again, thank you!"
32772,39087,2007-01-28,5,"Can you see me dancing?  I have HAPPY FEET! LOL This was quick, easy and just Fabulous.  I doubled the recipe for three, I have a teenage son still at home, and there was no leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I didn't even mind the extra calories.  This is definately going the my recipe box of all time special recipes.  I served it with a side salad and Texas Garlic Toast."
140132,39087,2007-02-01,5,"This is very good.  My whole family devoured this.  It has great flavor and easy to make too, which is a plus for me...lol.  I love the tomatoes in this with the added cream....how can you go wrong???  lol   Thank you for a nice pasta meal, I served this with a green salad and some garlic bread.......Stephanie"
426903,39087,2007-02-06,5,"My husband fell in love with this dish. The first time I made it, the sauce was not thick enough. The next time I added a little flour to thicken it, but I had to add more cajun seasoning to compensate. Still a wonderful recipe."
8688,39087,2007-02-14,5,"Excellent!! The chicken was flavorful and tender and the sauce was the perfect complement!  I used a full two cups of half and half because I found I was out of whipping cream.  The half and half worked perfectly well. I will most definitely serve this again : )  Thanks, Lorac!"
373817,39087,2007-02-28,5,"This is a great recipe! Everyone in our house loved it. It's definitely going on the favorites list! I made this as is, but next time I think I will add some fresh basil to mine. Very good!!"
207176,39087,2007-03-19,4,"I think this could be a five but my Cajun blend included salt and then with the sun dried tomatoes, added salt and Parmesan cheese, it was too salty. Next time I would use only Emeril's Essence and skip the salt and maybe skip the sundried tomatoes too.  I liked it but just had a too salty version. Thanks Lorac!"
316717,39087,2007-04-06,5,"used mirj's Recipe cajun #14190 for this. i had emeril's essence but read here that some used that and their pasta turned out salty...so i wanted to be safe n' made a homemade one since mirj's had no salt. i also cut back on the cajun seasoning since family isn't too fond of spicy food...i was real sad about cutting back on it but it still came out delicious. i also used bow tie pasta...the full 12 oz box. my mistake since it had no extra yummy sauce. also used 1 lb. of thin sliced chicken breast. recipe is awesome...other than MY mistakes it tasted like restaurant quality. alfredo w/ a kick. YUMMY. thanks for sharing and this will go in my fav recipe file! =)
update: tried it w/ shrimp this time and it was just as delicious!"
147109,39087,2007-04-12,4,"Very good, and we will be having this again, but next time I may add some peppers or mushrooms.  Thanks!"
347822,39087,2007-04-23,4,"Instead of throwing the chicken into the skillet, I placed the chunks on a baking sheet and baked them at 475 for 10 minutes.  I am not a big fan of cajun seasoning, I thought the flavor would be overwhelming, but I went ahead and took a bite.  Its a wonderful dish, the chicken meshed well with the cream sauce, very refreshing taste.  Served with capellini. Also, I had leftovers the next day and the sauce was even better. I added a little more parmesan than instructed. Thank you, loved the recipe."
182624,39087,2007-05-06,4,"This was very good!  I did use shrimp instead of chicken, otherwise followed everything as is.  Due to the very high fat content, I don't think I'd make this again though, or perhaps attempt to change it up to make it a bit healthier.  It's just a personal thing since we're trying to eat healthier, but this was enjoyed by all."
121185,39087,2007-05-11,3,"I thought, from the reviews we would LOVE this - but it wasn't anything wow for us.  It had a lot to do with the pepper kick it left in your throat.  My 3 kids all refused to eat it - even the spicy, salsa addicted teen.  DH and both enjoyed the taste but really found that it left a burn in your throat.  I was expecting some heat to the dish - but from the reviews, it didn't sound like it would be too spicy for our tastes...."
27643,39087,2007-05-14,5,"The only thing I changed was to half the cajun seasoning. It was great! Creamy, just enough spice for us, and it was very easy to prepare. This is a winner! Thanks Carol!"
125640,39087,2007-05-14,5,"Wonderful! I used whole wheat linguine, 1 3/4 cups cream and I couldn't find cajun seasoning and didn't feel like making my own, so I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. The flavors blend well with just a slight kick to the chicken. Next time I would probably add sautÃ©ed mushrooms and brocolli too. Quick and easy, wonderful flavor and tender chicken. My family liked this very much. Thanks for sharing.
Update - I tried this tossed with an asparagus stir-fry mix (asparagus, green beans, cauliflower, squash, and mushrooms) and it was really good."
230557,39087,2007-06-14,4,"Very good, though I would have preferred a thicker sauce (it should at least be reduced).  I added red pepper flakes at the table for more spice.  Thanks!"
368078,39087,2007-06-15,5,"AMAZING!!  We made just as the recipe stated, and used about 1 1/4 cups cream.  It was the perfect consistency for us.  Thanks for posting such a wonderful recipe - this is one we will make again and again!"
222433,39087,2007-06-23,5,"This was one of the best dinners I have ever made! Really, really good! Tasted like we were at a wonderful restraunt. This is what I am requesting for my birthday dinner next time! Thank you, thank you!"
52262,39087,2007-09-01,5,"Delicious!!!  Everyone loved this recipe!  My husband said he would pay for this in a restaurant.  I changed some of the amounts to accomodate for 4 adults and 5 children: 4 chicken breasts cut in 1 inch pieces, 16 oz. linguine, 3 t. cajun seasoning, about 2 T. butter, 2 c. heavy whipping cream, 1 c. fat-free 1/2 and 1/2, doubled the remaining items(tomatoes, spices, cheese).  At first I thought the sauce was too watery, but once I mixed it with the pasta and cheese it thickened beautifully.  Next time I may try to increase the amount of fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 and decrease the amount of cream to try to reduce the fat content even more.  A true winner of a dish!"
298447,39087,2007-09-11,5,"Top-notch recipe.  I give it 5 stars in every area...time, ease of prep., and outstanding flavor.
Love it with the Gerry sans Sanddunes version of sun-dried tomatoes  recipe #70005  and Mirj's  recipe #14190.  Make sure you have a baguette close by to clean the sauce off your plate- you'll be glad you did!"
146047,39087,2007-09-25,5,"This dish was fantastic-- a quick, easy fix great for a weeknight. I used Emeril's Essence for the cajun seasoning and about a cup of light cream and a pound of pasta.  I'm not a fan of sun-dried tomatoes so used fresh instead. Delicious and even my picky son enjoyed it!  Thanks so much."
252816,39087,2007-09-26,5,"This was SOoooooooGood. I made homemade italian bread to go with the meal.. My DH hates white sauces and he ate a big plate of this for supper.He only ate 1 slice of bread which was really unusal,but he wanted to save room for  this...He always salts everything but actually said this was a tad too salty..I used Louisiana cajun seasoning it  has salt added,so next time I will omit the 1/4 tsp salt.I used 1 cup whipping cream and added 3/4 cup half n half..I thickened the sauce slightly with cornstarch.....This recipe deserves 10 stars..I will be making this again..Thank You for this wonderful recipe..."
579298,39087,2007-09-30,5,"OMG! Delicious! (of course, the other 200+ ratings said so too). For anyone about to try this recipe, I would recommend on making enough for 1 lb of pasta. DH and I LOVED it and couldn't do with just 1 serving each. So I used 1 LB Pasta, 1 LB Chicken, 2 TBL Cajun Seasoning (unsalted HIGHLY recommend, even from a salt fiend like me), 1 1/2 CUP Heavy Whipping Cream, NO ADDITIONAL SALT, 1/2 TSP Basil, 1/4 TSP Pepper and Garlic Powder. And I didn't use any veggies. Although it would be a great addition :) YUM! Definitely restaurant quality!"
248023,39087,2007-10-04,4,"Yum!  I wanted something creamy and quick for dinner tonight and this really hit the spot.  I used only one chicken breasts since it was quite big and about 5 oz of angel hair pasta, since that was all I had in the house.  When I went to chop my sun dried tomatoes, I realized they were really no longer any good, so I substituted a red bell pepper from my garden.  I only had to use about 1 cup of heavy cream to coat the pasta.  It was sooooo good... I added a little red pepper flakes to add a little kick and we both loved it.  I will try it with the linguine next time!  Thanks for a keeper!"
377581,39087,2007-11-15,5,"Absolutely fantastic! Attractive, so easy and quick to fix. This was a hit with our family and guests. Turned out really delicious! I will be making this again. Thanks for posting!"
185285,39087,2007-12-11,5,"Ok... I normally wouldn't review a recipe where I subbed the main ingredient, but I feel that I would be doing Zaar a major disservice if I didn't rave about how great this dish is..... WITH SHRIMP!! Just Heavenly.  I used Recipe #41701 to 'prep' my tiger shrimp, which worked very well. I also skinnied up the recipe a bit by subbing the cream with fat free half & half and 2 tsps of cornstarch.  Absolutely divine. Thank you sooooo much."
76951,39087,2008-01-02,5,"Outstanding!  I doubled the sauce and used 5 chicken breasts to feed 4.  I had way too much cream but no problem - I just thickened it with some cornstarch.  Next time when it's just DH and I, I'll add mushrooms.  This is a keeper!"
331557,39087,2008-02-07,3,This is a nice quick weekday meal that won't be made too often because of the fat content.  I did not cook the chicken in butter and don't think that would be necessary.  It was a nice meal - I think the quality of cajun spice may contribute a lot towards the overall flavour of this dish and next time I make it I will use my homemade cajun and see if I like it better.  I also used five cloves of crushed garlic instead of the powder and two green onions.  It still needed some oomph so I will play around with it in the future.  Thanks for posting!
218535,39087,2008-03-03,4,This is delicious but we found 2 teaspoons of cajun seasoning to be too much. I'll reduce it to 1 teaspoons next time.
447123,39087,2008-03-31,5,"If my eyes were closed I would have thought I was in heaven!!! This is an amazing dish!!! I had some chicken oh hand and needed a way to make it. This really is super great. Would be a great recipe to impress the guests. Definently have some bread to sop up the sauce. There definently will be no more left when everyone is done. Thank you Lorac for a great dinner:)

As an added tip: Put in about a quarter to a half cup of mozzarella cheese in. Adds a nice cheese touch!!"
250031,39087,2008-04-11,4,"Very nice! And Easy! My favorite kind of recipe! I had to feed five so I doubled the recipe, using 2 cups of fat-free half & half. I also added some flour for thickener as others recommended. I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes--and my family doesn't care for them--so I omitted them. Family requested some color, though, so next time I may add some small broccoli florets. Definitely a keeper! The young male of the house wants it spicier, too, but it was fine as is for us girls."
774665,39087,2008-04-12,5,"This is a great weeknight meal! My husband devoured it! I doubled the sauce, added bell pepper, and doubled the spice. I also added a sprinkle of four to the chicken to help thicken the sauce. Wonderful!"
632249,39087,2008-04-17,4,We all liked this dish but think we would  prefer it with seafood. The sauce was really thin so I thickened it with cornstarch.  I think that the brand of Cajun spice can effect the outcome  alot.  I would like to try again with another brand of spice to see if there is a difference because the Cajun spice I bought is a bit  too salty. Thx Lorac!
173579,39087,2008-04-24,5,Very good meal.  Quick and easy .  Thanks for posting.
489552,39087,2008-05-27,5,"OMG!!  This was just heavenly.  I can't believe how easy and good this dish was.  I made this last week Friday, and I am making it again today (Tuesday)
Thank you so much for a great dish that will be a regular at our table :)"
74281,39087,2008-06-10,5,"One of the highest rated pasta recipes here, so I HAD to try it! It is as everyone says, delicious! I followed other's advice and doubled all of the ingredients except used 3 cups of heavy cream and it was enough to cover the entire 16-oz package of pasta with no problem. Leftovers heated up really well too. I did put a shaker of cajun seasoning at the table for those who wanted their pasta spicier and also had freshly grated parmesean cheese for garnish. Delicious and easy to throw together makes this an excellent meal!"
847160,39087,2008-06-30,5,wow ...that is so simple .... and super good ... one of the best on this site
178742,39087,2008-08-31,5,"I just wanted to correct my typos.. it's the same review!

Okay, I just made it last night, and had leftovers today for lunch.. And OMG, I thought it was good yesterday.. it's was even better as leftovers! I'm one of those people that can not handle chicken and then eat it.. so I decided to use shrimp and make enough for the next day dinner (or lunch). My changes to the recipe were as follows.. 1 1/2LBS RAW SHRIMP, 16oz ANGEL HAIR PASTA. I coated my shrimp with my own desired amount of my CREOLE SEASONING (probably a cup), plus additional garlic powder, threw in the basil and black pepper at this time. 4TBLBS BUTTER, 3 GREEN ONIONS (TOPS AND BOTTOMS), 2 CUPS HEAVY CREAM, 1 CAN DICED TOMATOES, added my black pepper and basil to my shrimp coating. I just melted my butter, then threw in all together the green onions, heavy cream, tomatoes. Heated thru, then added my shrimp.. heated thru til shrimp turned translucent, about 5 mins. Then tossed in my Angel Hair Pasta and Parmesean cheese. It all came together very quickly! It's definitely a 30 minute meal.. We had salad and garlic bread to accompany. Thanks soooo much for sharing! The flavors were sooooo good!"
222970,39087,2008-11-08,5,"I don't know that this needs one more five star review, but it was exceptional. I served it with salad and breadsticks for an Italian-restaurant type meal.

I left out the additional salt. Doubled the recipe to feed two adults and six children including visitors.

Oh -- I didn't have sun dried tomatoes, so I thinly sliced a fresh tomato and microwaved it at half power for about 20 minutes until it looked sun dried.

Thanks for posting!"
103876,39087,2008-11-10,5,I have had this saved in my cookbook and wanting to try for a long time.  I finally made it this past weekend and know now that I should have tried it much sooner!  I used a combination of half & half and fat-free half & half to make it more healthy and also substituted turkey sausage for the chicken.  It was really great and I know I will make this many times again.  Thanks for posting!
969481,39087,2008-11-12,5,"OK... This really doesn't need yet another 5 stars, but I'm going to anyway. This is a five star plus in my book. We have made this several times since I found this recipe and this dish gets requested quite often in my house.. from the DH and the kids! I use rigatoni only because my teenage daughter likes that particular pasta. Of course, any pasta works well with this dish. If there are leftovers, they are gone the next day! Thanks for sharing!"
371738,39087,2008-11-15,5,"I used recipe #14681 for the sun-dried tomatoes in this recipe and I must say 550 reviews cannot be wrong.  This is truly so scrumptious and a quick-fix meal.  Thanks, Lorac, for another winner!"
353131,39087,2008-11-25,5,I know you don't need another review but I had to say I made this for DH and kids a week ago and they loved it!!! I didnot put the tomatoes in and had to use grated monterey jack cheese but other than that I stuck to recipe. This is easy and delicious!!!
251626,39087,2008-12-09,5,"One of the very best chicken recipes I have ever made. Just the right amount of kick, but still similar to chicken alfredo. I have made it many times since seeing it. Thank You."
1072593,39087,2008-12-15,5,Should you need one signature dish in life...this would be it!
126440,39087,2009-01-05,5,"I made this with one chicken breast and 1/2 lb. shrimp.  Cooked the chicken first then added the shrimp.  When shrimp was turned the first time, I added the remaining ingredients but only 1 t. sun dried tomatoes and 3/4 c. half and half.  I sprinkled 1 t. cajun seasoning on each the chicken and shrimp while cooking.  It was excellent!  I will make this often for special dinners."
1122161,39087,2009-01-11,5,"This recipe turned out great! I only had one chicken breast, but I thought that was more than enough meat. The sauce was very tasty, and not spicy at all. Maybe next time I'll add another teaspoon of cajun seasoning. Great one, thanks Lorac!"
439797,39087,2009-01-29,5,"This is awesome. Everyone loved it. I multiplied everything by 4, so I could use a pound of linguine. But only used 3 chicken breasts. Turned them into little medallions with my food processor. Only used about 2 cups of whipping cream and thickened everything with about a tbs of cornstarch."
242484,39087,2009-02-25,5,"Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about!  You will think you're eating a $15 pasta dish at Olive Garden!"
315055,39087,2009-04-06,5,"Phenomenal!  I made this with only a few substitutions - I used another reviewer's suggestion and used fire roasted diced tomatoes (a whole can) in leiu of the sun dried tomatoes, I also used light cream instead of heavy cream.  It was a little liquidy, but letting it simmer longer made it thick and creamy.  Very good, would definitely make again!"
64642,39087,2009-04-11,0,a most excellent recipe
26512,39087,2009-05-28,5,"Absolutely delicious! I served this over angel hair pasta and the only thing I changed was to add some red pepper flakes for a bit more spice. I used a homemade Emeril's Essence and I may have added a bit more than called for - I was pretty liberal with it and I didn't measure. Oh, I also added a very tiny bit of white wine to the pan. I do think this would be outstanding with either ham or shrimp as well. We really liked this dish a lot, thumbs up from everyone, it will go on the regular rotation. Thanks for posting!

Update - Well, I finally did make this with shrimp as a surprise for my DD's 26th birthday. She absolutely loved it. Again, the only change I made was to add a splash of white wine and I used large shrimp. We topped with finely chopped green onion. We did use fettucine this time. DD says this is her new ""birthday dinner"". I think after 5 years this is definitely a very rich treat and a rare one, but truly a great recipe."
189475,39087,2009-09-03,4,"It was good, but not as good as I expected it to be"
226863,39087,2009-10-25,5,"Loved the taste of this recipe!  So easy and so delicious.  I did find the sauce a little thin, so I thickened it with a little cornstarch so that it would stick to the linguine.  Fabulous dish!  Thanks Lorac.  I'm so glad I chose this recipe tonight!"
879716,39087,2009-12-29,5,"DH and I have given this 5 stars from the first taste but I'm writing a new review because after making this several times, I have learned a few things that may help others.  One time I substituted half and half but the sauce never thickened properly and I won't try that again.  Tonight I used my food processor to make the sauce.  I put a quarter of a medium onion in the bowl along with the sundried tomatoes and a spoon full of bottled minced garlic.  Added the spices and pulsed until it was pureed.  Then I poured in the heavy cream and pulsed a few times to combine (don't pulse too much or you'll have whipped cream).  I sauteed my shrimp (instead of chicken) in the cajun spice until they were partially cooked and then poured in the sauce.  After simmering a few minutes I turned off the burner and tossed in some cooked thin spaghetti.  Coated the noodles in the sauce and tossed with parmesan.  This was the best yet!  Next time I'd like to pair this dish with some squash, zuchinni, mushrooms, and brocolli sauteed in the cajun butter!  Yummy  :)  Thanks again for this recipe!"
44383,39087,2010-02-13,4,"Really quite good.  Easy to put together, followed recipe exactly.  I used 2 cups of heavy cream but next will use only 1 as it was a bit too juicy.  Thanks for posting."
637486,39087,2010-02-21,5,"Yum, Yum, Yum!  This was so good.  The only changes I made was to bake the chicken in the oven with the cajun seasoning and then add it to the sauce mixture.  I would love to tone down the calories somehow, but the flavor was superb!"
227607,39087,2010-04-08,5,This was WONDERFUL!  I don't make a lot of pasta dishes but this will be a repeat.
1506604,39087,2010-04-06,5,EASY & YUMM!! explains it all. Has 1 of the highest ratings on the Zaar for a reason..
1133190,39087,2010-08-11,5,"This was amazing! Far better than any alfredo sauce i've made. I omitted the salt as recommended by others (i agree, it doesn't need it) and used half & half instead of cream since that's all i had on hand.  The half & half worked great but you do have to be careful to not leave it on the heat too long!  The only thing I would change about this next time would be to change the chicken to sauce ratio.  I felt I could almost double the sauce or half the chicken, depending on if i wanted leftovers or not I suppose.  Thanks so much for posting, we'll be making this again and again!"
73469,39087,2010-09-27,5,"Not that this needs another review, but this is awesome. I make this dish all of the time now. It's easy and my guests think that I've spent a long time making this. The only thing that I would like to add is that the sauce seems to be better the next day!"
362983,39087,2011-05-06,5,This was tasty! The sauce was a bit thin for me though; so I'd probably add some cornstarch/water into it next time. Nice change of pace from the usual red sauces. Thanks! :)
132383,39087,2011-07-19,5,"This is another rave review......My husband and I have made this too many times to count, and I can't believe I forgot to rate it!  We always make exactly as written...it is divine. Thank you so much for posting."
43083,39087,2011-12-08,5,*original review 5/29/07*My friend and I made this this weekend at her house and we had to omit the sun dried tomatoes & green onion but this was SOOOO good! OMG..I loved it and will make it again!!!! ////////// 11/29/10 - I remade this tonight and included the sun dried tomatoes and green onions. Yum:) I had to use half n half but it didnt affect taste. My friend came over and really enjoyed it as well. Thanks! **Edited 12/8/11 to add stars**
456858,39087,2012-01-01,4,"I was searching recipes and came across this again.  I am pretty sure I made this awhile ago, and must have forgotten to rate and review.  I usually rate and review for two reasons, one to keep track what recipes I have tried and of course, my thoughts about the recipe and two, to provide honest feedback.  What I remember about this recipe, is that is was pretty good. Good tasting, but not good on the waistline ;-)"
1365025,39087,2012-03-29,5,ohlalalalala! This was soooo good and I had soooo many thoughts about using all that Cajun seasoning. The seasonings were right on. Followed the recipe except for the sun-dried tomatoes (didn't have any). This deserves a 10  rating. What a outstanding recipe. Thank you Lorac.
191533,39087,2012-05-03,4,"Hmm- pretty good. To decrease the fat, I made a white sauce with butter, milk, and flour instead of using cream. I also used rotini pasta instead of linguine, which was not a great choice on my part! But I like how simple this recipe is. I will make it again!"
928301,39087,2012-08-09,4,"I doubled the spices, but still wanted more flavor.  My husband said it was good though.  I appreciated the ease of making it.  I'm sure I'll make this again."
145352,39087,2012-08-30,5,I x4 the recipe to use 1 lb of pasta. I also used roasted red pepper instead of sun dried tomatoes. Was great!!!
97579,39087,2012-10-19,5,"This was delicious!  I had to do some modifications based on what I had on hand.  I added roasted red bell peppers chopped up to the cooked chicken mix.  I don't like to use heavy cream if I don't need to, so I used 1/2 percent milk and added a bit of corn starch to thicken.  I also cut the chicken up in small pieces.  Everybody LOVED it!  I will definitely make this again!!"
135887,39087,2013-01-06,0,"I doubled the recipe (using just under 2 cups of cream).   Next time I will not add the salt as I think the cajun seasoning had enough and it seemed a bit salty.  Also, the sauce seemed a bit runny so instead of adding the parmesan to the top I melted it into the sauce before I removed it from the heat.  This helped the sauce to thicken up nicely.  Very nice and QUICK dinner."
2549237,39087,2013-02-14,4,"This was really good.  I am sick so my husband made this for Valentine's Day dinner and it was restaurant quality.  I couldn't find Cajun seasoning so he used soul seasoning instead.  We both agree that next time it would be better with more sun-dried tomatoes, wilted spinach and mushrooms.  We served it with salad and garlic bread for a delicious meal."
937635,39087,2013-09-29,5,"My husband makes this at the firehouse for the guys so you know it&#039;s good! I made it once at home and it was soooo awesome, much better imho than alfredo. YUM"
620763,39087,2013-10-30,4,"This was very good.  I went easy with the Cajun spice, but in the end it was not spicy at all, so next time I will use more. I also used 1 cup of cream, but could have used more as there was no sauce after adding the pasta."
1581225,39087,2014-10-20,5,"A very tasty pasta dish. I agree with other reviewers, it&#039;s like alfredo, but with a kick! The sun-dried tomatoes add extra tang and flavour to each mouthful. I saved the leftovers and took them to work the next day. One thing I learned with cream based pasta dishes, and any pasta really, is it is better if you store and reheat the pasta and the sauce separately. If you don&#039;t, the pasta soaks up most of the sauce and the pasta is gluggy but the sauce is either dry or separated!"
9869,20155,2002-06-30,5,"Really tasty potato salad, I used my own rhubarb chutney and as I had no celery seeds I used a little celery salt instead.
The added bacon is a definite plus, thanks for posting Karen.  =)"
59473,20155,2003-01-20,4,This salad was great. I added less bacon than the recipe called for and it was still good. I will make this again.
64934,20155,2003-05-07,5,"Very tasty!  I made it the way the recipe called for, but added a little extra bacon, just to finish the package off.  We all loved it and now that barbecue season is here, I'll be making it more often.  Thanks Karen! "
39835,20155,2003-05-12,5,Excellent potato salad and so easy! I made a few changes because I was out of some of the ingredients--instead of bacon I used artificial bacon bits and I eliminated the celery. I also ran out of mayonnaise and used about 1 cup of mayonnaise and 1/2 cup of low-fat sour cream. The only other change I made was slicing the hard-boiled eggs instead of chopping them.  Even with my subsitutions this salad was excellent and will definitely be making it again this summer.
59780,20155,2004-05-08,5,"This was the first potato salad that I have ever made and it was fantastic! I love the flavour that the bacon gave it. Thanks so much for suggesting this salad for my May menu, I plan to make it often over the summer months!"
37636,20155,2004-10-25,5,"This is majorly yummy! It has just the right touch of mustard- which leaves it not quite like a mustard-style salad but with a little more oomph than a homestyle salad has. The bacon also adds excellent flavor. It is very simple to make- which is great in a recipe, but perhaps most of all, I love that it has simple ingredients, the type I usually have on hand all the time. So this is great to make when I don't want to run to the market for some special ingredient. Thanks for posting!"
53932,20155,2005-09-05,4,"I'm very picky about potato salads and this is a good one.  I used  creole mustard, a little more salt than indicated and also added pepper.  I didn't add sugar and added less relish than called for (just personal preferences).  The bacon adds a nice flavor to the salad."
231054,20155,2006-06-30,5,"Yum, YUM!  Thanks Karen!  I just put this together and it was awesome AND I'll bet it will be even better onoce it sits in the fridge and gets cold and the flavors blend some.  I'm one of those that needs the onion and eggs in my potato salad -- so I added them.  But I don't think I added as much onion as you had indicated.  I like a ""hint"" of onion -- nothing that would overwhelm all the other wonderful flavors in the salad.  I have your Macaroni Salad marked as well and will be trying it soon (123107).  I'm going through my recipe files now and deleting all references to other potato salads!!!!  Thanks, Bobbie"
278113,20155,2006-09-04,5,"I am really picky about potato salad, and this was GREAT! I did find that I prefer it without the added salt. I will use this recipe again and again...thanks for sharing!"
229850,20155,2006-10-07,5,"Made this today to go with some BBQ Pork Steaks, and baked beans, it was fabulous! What a nice change from our usual salads. I have never put bacon or cider vinegar in my potato salad before, it was delightfully different!Will make this again! Thanx"
347822,20155,2006-11-05,4,"Great taste.  Suggestions - cut back on the celery seeds, a little overpowering. "
394077,20155,2007-01-03,4,Delish.  Thank you for sharing your recipe. DH loves it and kept asking what in it that makes it tastes so different.
169969,20155,2007-04-05,5,I made a double batch of this to accompany lunch for a group of construction workers and they absolutely loved it! One guy even asked for the recipe!!! I weighed the potatoes and the mayo amount was perfect for the pounds listed. I used Vidalia Onions instead of Red Onions and also omitted the egg. I chopped up regular pickles as we were out of relish. I would make this again and again. Fabulous Potato Salad! Thanks Karen!
377039,20155,2007-06-12,0,"What a wonderful and flexible recipe.  I made so many modifications that I'm reluctant to leave a star rating -- I used this recipe as inspiration rather than instructions!  I omitted the celery, halved the celery seeds, omitted the eggs, subbed onion powder instead of chopped onion, tripled the sugar and mustard, and added a bit of garlic, a teaspoon of no-salt seasoning, a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and a half teaspoon of regular black pepper.  Still tasted great, though a bit too mustardy and sweet (I wasn't reading the amounts and put in quite a bit too much)!  Served with BBQ Pork Steak and went over great.  Thanks, Karen!  I'll try this again sometime -- PROPERLY -- and give a star rating."
55729,20155,2007-09-05,5,This is outstanding! Everyone preferred it to my usual potato salad.
248023,20155,2007-10-12,4,"I never liked potato salad...until NOW!!!  Everytime in the past when I had potato salad, it was either too crunchy or too mushy...too dry or way too mayonaisey... I guess my picky palette was trying to tell me I needed to make some homemade!  I scaled this down to 3-4 servings for the two us to have with some hamburgers on the grill. I did not boil the potatoes, but instead used some leftover baked potatoes I had in the fridge.  I just peeled and cubed them.  I'm not too fond of raw onions either, so I just put in the tiniest bit, very finely chopped.  I liked the color they gave to the salad.  I used a half and half mix of mayo and miracle whip dressing and did add in the egg. I really liked this salad.  It was a great refreshing compliment to our grilled hamburgers.  Thanks for a potato salad I will be making from now on!"
177933,20155,2007-10-30,5,"Excellent in every way!  I halved the recipe and omitted the celery and onion.  My husband raved and said never to make another potato salad, so this is it!  Thanks for a family favorite.  Oh...and my 18 month old devoured it too!"
140132,20155,2008-01-17,5,"Oh my. I made this just as written and it is so delicious.  We love potato salad anyway but the added flavors in this is outstanding.  I will not go back to my old recipe.  This is my recipe from now on.  Wow, so good.  The only thing I will do differently next time is chop the celery a little smaller.  DD likes celery but chopped finely, no problem.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe.  I can't wait to try this out on family and friends they are gonna love it too.  Thank you for this ""show off"" recipe......Stephanie"
56087,20155,2008-03-23,5,"THANK YOU Karen for incredible Potato Salad recipe.  Not only will my Hubby eat it, but he said he could ""live on it"".  Was easy to prepare, tastes great,  what more could one ask for.  I've always used my Mom's recipe but I'm thinking I've found my new stand by."
400420,20155,2008-06-08,5,"This is really good!  I really don't care for a sweet potato salad, so I did change it a bit by subbing chopped dill pickles for the relish and leaving out the sugar all toghether.  I also had to use white onion instead of red, which I chopped very finely.  I used just 1 cup of mayo, becaue I ran out, but it was plenty.  This will be my ""go to"" potato salad from now on!   Thank you!"
185285,20155,2008-07-10,5,Yum! Just like mom used to make. I double the celery because I'm addicted to the crunch it gives.  In a small batch (for test) I tossed in a bit of chopped curly parsley and really like it. Topped it all off with some paprika - and Wow!
637486,20155,2009-03-12,5,"This was a really great potato salad.  The only changes I made were to leave out the egg (I don't like them either), and I used a whole grain spicy mustard and that gave it a good kick!  I think I am going to make this my go-to potato salad recipe from now on!  Thanks!"
294000,20155,2009-07-04,5,"I took this to a 4th of July (well, 3rd of July) event. Potato salad is about the only thing I make without measuring, by taste, the way my mother and grandmother made theirs. After seeing all the great reviews I decided to try some of the ingredients in this recipe. I never thought to add bacon to potato salad. It adds great flavor. I used about 10 small-medium potatoes, 12 oz. of bacon, a whole onion, and kind of guessed on the celery... maybe 3-4 stalks. I subbed dill pickles for the relish and kind of guessed on that amount as well. I love hard-boiled eggs in my p. salad so I probably used close to a dozen. I stuck with the mayo and other ingredient measurements although left out the celery seeds b/c I didn't have any. I threw in some pepper and paprika as well. A friend attending the event said it was the best potato salad she's ever had. Everyone really enjoyed it and gave it great compliments. I think I may have just changed our family potato salad ""recipe"". Thanks!"
1122161,20155,2009-07-13,5,"I never tasted a good potato salad until now! The perfect amount of everything, and I don't know if it makes a difference boiling the potatoes with the skin on and then peeling, but they seemed to hold together better than usual. I am so grateful that you posted this recipe!! I will be using it often. Thank you!!!"
146047,20155,2009-07-27,5,"Loved this. I omitted the bacon and eggs and it was still delicious. Also, went with 2 Tbsp of the relish and omitted the sugar as I didn't want it to be sweet. I'd recommend making it a day in advance because it was so much better the next day, after the flavors had time to meld. Thanks for posting!"
198154,20155,2010-01-09,3,"Let me start by saying when it comes to potato salad, my family is very picky.  So the fact that they all ate some of this is amazing in itself. I liked it enough that I kept picking at it, but not enough to sit down and eat a big scoop all at one time.  DH had no problem doing that though and ate the majority of the leftover with his lunches at work."
839492,20155,2010-05-02,5,"I used Yukon Gold potatoes and reduced the mayo by about 1/4 c., otherwise followed the recipe to a ""T"". The bacon tip was very efficient. Thanks for sharing."
55578,20155,2010-06-27,5,Very good!  Thanks for the recipe.
173579,20155,2010-08-26,5,This is a wonderful potato salad.  Loved the bacon in it.  It was so creamy and delicious.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
103876,20155,2011-07-04,5,I understand why this recipe has so many great reviews.  I made for my 4th of July dinner and must say that it was perfect.  I used yukon gold potatoes and mixed everything together the night before.  My guests commented on the potato salad right away and everyone really liked it.  I just wish I had more left over!  I'm sure this will be the potato salad recipe I make from now on.  Thanks for posting.
350750,20155,2011-07-28,5,I really enjoyed this but my husband didn't care for the celery taste.  I doubled the recipe but kept the onions and celery the same.  Thanks for a great potato salad!
158086,20155,2012-03-15,5,Very good potato salad.  Never put bacon in potato salad before but it works!
937635,20155,2014-04-27,5,"I think this might be the best potato salad ever made. I&#039;m so excited to bring it to my fam BBQ tomorrow and show off :) I only used 1/2 tsp of salt, 1tsp celery seeds (mine are kind of old, so I&#039;m not confident about their flavor) and added 4 eggs. Thanks for the forever and ever keeper!!! Update: I make this all the time and it is frequently requested by family. I use 6 slices of bacon, and this past time used 1 tsp of celery salt to replace the celery seed and salt. So delicious thank you!"
22015,2496,2006-01-21,5,"Excellent!   I made this for my dear friend's birthday and it was a huge hit.   I used some wonderful dutch cocoa that another Zaarite sent me and it was dark, moist, rich and wonderful.    Exactly the kind of thing that I was looking for - thank you!"
184723,2496,2006-02-18,5,This cake was just wonderful!  I frosted with peanut butter frosting and my husband has eaten half of it already!!!
52262,2496,2006-03-26,5,"A super easy, delicious from scratch cake!  I iced the two-layer cake with the Really Easy and Good Chocolate Buttercream Frosting Recipe #89207.  It was a great combination.  My friends thought it was a store bought cake.  I used whole milk to ensure moistness.  I'm not sure if this was necessary but I wanted to be safe.  The 30 minutes of bake time was perfect."
124249,2496,2006-06-25,5,"Made this for my daughter-in-laws birthday. A very moist and delicious cake.

Thanks Marg@Cayman Designs.

13483,2496,2006-08-21,5,"This does not take too much longer to make than a boxed cake.  However, you do avoid all the non pronouncable ingredients found in a box cake.  And to boot, this is delicious and moist.  I cut it into small portions and froze them.  I now have a mini dessert every night for a while.  Thanks again Marg."
142464,2496,2006-09-26,5,What a lovely chocolate cake - so very moist and flavorful.  The only thing wrong is it disappears mighty fast!!  This one definitely found a place in my cookbook.
199792,2496,2006-12-04,5,"A very nice cake, moist and chocolaty, It really puffed up in the oven but fell quite a bit after coming out of the oven and ended up looking very much like Fawn's picture. I put a chocolate fudge icing on it. I think it would be nicer with a brown sugar icing but the birthday guy wanted chocolate so chocolate it was.
Thank you, Marg."
128473,2496,2007-01-15,5,"This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tried.  It's official,  it tastes as great as it smells while baking. The cake is rich, thick, light and moist, tender and it explodes with chocolate flavour and has a wonderful texture. Thanks so much for sharing Marg, I love your recipes, they never disappoint."
8688,2496,2007-02-15,5,"Now, this is a real chocolate cake!  There is no question when diving into a slice of this dense, moist and deeply flavorful cake that you are eating ~ chocolate!  Easy to follow instructions for the perfect 2 layer chocolate heaven!   I used recipe #89207 using the most cocoa powder (3/4 cup) for the darkest and deepest chocolate frosting.  Thank you, Marg, for a wonderful, chocolate experience : )"
140132,2496,2007-08-15,5,What a moist cake.  I've never been a big fan of chocolate cake as I've always thought they were dry and crumbly.  Not so. This is a delicious recipe....thank you for opening my eyes to chocolate cake....mmmmmmm.  This is a winner in my books since its so simple and basic ingredients.....thank you.....Stephanie
176615,2496,2007-09-12,5,Delicious! Made this for DH's birthday along with recipe#89207 as Marg suggested. I live in a very humid area so took Marg's advice and used 2/3 cup water. Mine did fall slightly as it cooled but was still quite moist without being heavy or thick. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
402559,2496,2007-10-07,5,"Yummy! Used 1/2 cup butter instead of the oil, egg substitute for the eggs and the full cup of boiling water. Light, fluffy, moist and chocolaty. Will make again, thanks!"
74281,2496,2008-03-17,5,"Rich and delicious dark chocolate cake that turned out as great as all previous 168 ratings! My DD boyfriend loves dark chocolate cake with chocolate frosting so I made this - my very first scratch chocolate cake. It was very easy and although were lots of warnings about the thinness of the batter, I was still surprised and nervous (I used 3.4 cup boiling water) about just how thin the batter is. No need to worry though, this cake turned out great! I frosted it with the medium version of Recipe #89207."
373817,2496,2008-03-18,5,I made this for my friend's birthday party and everyone loved it! Now I'm looking for an excuse to make a cake again because this is absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!
222970,2496,2008-05-25,5,"I can't believe I haven't written a review. This is my standard chocolate cake. I don't want to go back to boxed. Turns out rich and moist.

It just takes a couple of minutes more than making a boxed cake."
125640,2496,2008-06-15,5,"I made this for my sister's birthday and it was a hit. I used dark cocoa and reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also subbed coffee extract for 1 tsp of the vanilla. Nice, moist and tender cake. Easy to make and delicious. Thanks for sharing."
92816,2496,2008-08-27,5,I doubled the recipe to make a double layer cake for a baby shower.It was perfect.Everyone asked where I had bought the cake.It was delicious!
229524,2496,2008-10-19,4,"This was my 1st cake from scratch and it came out really nice.  Had to make some adjustments since I live in Colorado.  Did add 1 extra egg.  My cake came out perfect, didn't sink.  It is a little work but well worth it."
620763,2496,2009-02-20,3,"This cake tasted really good, but it completely overflowed in the pan. I only used 3/4 cup of water after reading other reviews about it overflowing, but it still did. I am so glad I placed my pan on top of a cookie sheet or the whole oven would have been smoking. Because it overflowed I had all dried up batter stuck all over the pan. What a mess!  I will not be making this recipe again."
104295,2496,2009-05-14,5,"Perfect for what I needed, a not too hard to make chocolate cake that I could make in layers and frost.  Thanks."
1133190,2496,2009-07-12,5,Excellent! I made it for my dad for fathers day (a dark chocolate lover) and he was highly impressed. I'll be making this again!
318235,2496,2009-08-24,4,"Pretty good cake, I was looking for a richer chocolate flavor though. It came out well. It did rise a ton! I followed the 2/3 fill suggestion and I still overflowed. Also, I made one with no parchment lining and it got stuck to the bottom even though I sprayed it with Pam, so i would recommend taking the extra step to do the parchment lining. Cake was moist though and the recipe came together well."
250031,2496,2009-12-13,5,"Made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was perfect. I bought dark cocoa to make sure it was a ""dark chocolate"" cake. I made a two-layer cake and frosted with Recipe #129329. No need to ever use a box mix when this is so easy and SO good."
58836,2496,2010-02-14,5,"Made this as the cake for recipe 11799 and it turned out great.  I got lot of requests for the recipe.  Thanks, I'm sure I will make again."
140806,2496,2010-02-16,5,"How can a person love a food as passionately as I love this cake? It is positively sinful how delicious this turned out. Turned it into a football shaped cake for a Super Bowl party. Almost too moist to frost but I somehow managed.
Thanks for another great recipe!"
362983,2496,2010-04-25,5,"This took NO time at all! I read through sooo many of the reviews and got really excited to make this cake and it still went above and beyond my expectations! I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 3/4 cup boiling water.. also added a tiny bit of instant coffee for a little oomph. The cake is actually still cooling down right now, but I used a bit of the batter to make mini chocolate cupcakes and those are DELICIOUS! Only took 10 minutes for those to bake, then I topped those with some frosting (89207) and chocolate sprinkles and oh man, I am so excited to share both the cake and cupcakes with everyone. Baked the cake in a rectangular pan (mine was a touch smaller than 13x9 so it only took like 32 minutes to be perfect) The cake hasn't sunk at all! Rose beautifully and it's still ginormous! Can not wait to ice it and dive in. I'll have to try a round layered cake next time too! Thank you so much!!! :)"
357358,2496,2010-10-12,5,Moist and flavorful. I made this for a friend and decided that I *do* like chocolate cake after all!
185446,2496,2010-10-13,3,"This cake had so many good reviews, I'm wondering where mine went wrong.  It looked good coming out of the oven, but deflated quite a bit upon cooling.  The top was very crumbly--hard to spread frosting on, and the taste just average.  I'm not trying to plug one of my own recipes, but Moist Chocolate Cake (#2766846) is hands down more delicate, tastier, attractive, and most important--pretty much fool-proof.  The recipes are similar--after trying both, I'll stick with my own."
142559,2496,2011-06-12,5,"Stunning cake!!  Incredibly moist and delicious - super easy!! I halved the recipe and made two 6-inch layers for my husband's birthday cake.  I topped with a light coconut buttercream and toasted coconut.  Thank you so much for posting!! Hands down, the best chocolate cake I've ever had!"
1179225,2496,2011-09-11,5,Excellent!
126440,2496,2011-10-17,5,Very easy but delicious cake.  I made half a recipe using a 9X9 inch pan.  Turned out great but may have over baked it a bit.  Baked for 35 min.  I did use the choc. buttercream for the frosting which was also great.  Made for a very rich birthday cake.  Want to try it with coffee next time.
394077,2496,2011-10-30,4,This cake tastes better the next day. I used buttermilk for milk because that is all I had. The cake is moist and the crumb is tender.
103876,2496,2013-07-11,5,My daughter used this recipe to make cupcakes for my son&#039;s graduation party.  The texture and flavor were perfect.  She frosted them with chocolate ganache.  So good!
350750,2496,2015-09-06,5,My son wanted chocolate cake for his fifth birthday and this is the one I chose to make.  It was easy to make into cupcakes and tasted great. Thank you!
1581225,2496,2017-02-05,5,"Wow, I used this recipe to make cupcakes, and they turned out so tasty, soft and moist. I used kittencal's chocolate frosting recipe for the frosting. Perfect! Everyone loved them."
55729,18391,2003-04-25,3,"Sorry to be the ""party pooper"" here, but this is one of those ""coconut"" recipes - either you like it or you don't. I didn't. However, my 2 picky kids who don't eat anything both did. I used sherry, and most of a 1.58oz tube of anchovy paste (minus about 1 T that I had used before). I also used 1/2 tsp. garlic powder because I was out of fresh garlic. I urge everyone to try this. I get the impression that if it's for you, it will be positively heavenly!"
9869,48532,2003-02-02,5,"Delicious cookie, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.
I used crunchy peanut butter, and Cadbury's Energy chocolate.
The recipe made 28 scrummy cookies. Thanks for posting."
37036,48532,2003-02-27,5,"These were awesome! I used ""were"" because they are already gone!  I should have known to double the recipe with my little cookie monsters hanging around the house!  I normally use dark brown sugar in my peanut butter cookies, but all I had on hand was light brown sugar.  They still turned out delicious!  I will try them with the dark brown sugar next time! I used the Nestle's semi-sweet chocolate chunks... umm umm good! This recipe is a definite ""keeper""!"
8629,48532,2003-08-03,5,"Excellent cookie. Nice, soft texture.  Easy to put together.  Don't bake these cookies unless you have cold milk on hand.  Not for the recipe of course, but to drink with the cookies after they've cooled a bit from the oven.  They are heaven."
37449,48532,2003-09-30,5,"These cookies turned out very nicely. The peanut butter gave it a nice twist, the texture was soft and it satisfied! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips cause that's what I had on hand. Thank you!"
8688,48532,2005-02-17,5,I made these cookies over the holidays and forgot to write my review.  These cookies are excellent and a nice change of pace from regular chocolate chip cookies. Nice and chewy and just the right size. Combining the peanut butter and chocolate just hits the spot. Don't forget your glass of milk. : )
56087,48532,2005-02-20,5,My Grandsons wanted their usual cookies that I bake for them on Fridays however they couldn't decide between Peanut butter and Chocolate chip.  I pulled up Zaar and what appeared but this recipe.  I followed it to the letter and they turned out wonderful.  I think they need to sit for a day to let the full PB flavor come thru.  They do literally melt in your mouth.  Thanks for a great alternative to PB or Choc. Chip Cookies.
160974,48532,2005-02-25,5,"Inspired by Juju Bee's great photo and Mean Chef's Reputation, I knew I'd love these! I did add a touch of maple extract, since I didn't have dark brown sugar (only light). I really loved the pliable texture of the cookies.

Roxygirl in Colo."
88099,48532,2005-03-22,5,These were very good cookies.  I liked the peanut butter flavor.  Made these for our mother/daughter retreat weekend and they were gone the first night.  Thanks Mean for another great recipe.
64583,48532,2005-08-24,4,"Very good cookies - nice texture and yummy taste.  It doesn't say in the recipe how long to bake, but mine took about 10-11 minutes.  "
168462,48532,2005-12-29,5,Everyone loved these. I used rainbow chocolate chips and regular margarine. These are easy to prepare. Thanks for the recipe.
173579,48532,2006-05-01,5,These were some of the best cookies I have ever eaten.  Very flavorful.  My family really enjoyed these.  Thanks for posting.
185446,48532,2007-12-10,4,"Easy to make and eat. Sounds like everyone likes these cookies, me included.  Thanks, P4."
400420,48532,2007-02-17,5,"My 16 y/o daughter bought cookie dough to make cookies for her boyfriend for valentines day.  She and her girlfriend baked the batch and split them, but our dog ate my daughter's portion!!  I said I'd find a good recipe and help her make homemade cookies that would be so much better than any of those refridgerated kinds.  She wanted to make them by herself, even though, while she has helped me in the kitchen, the only things she cooks by herself are Malt-o-Meal and basted eggs. The cookies turned out fantastic and were a huge hit.  They looked and tasted great and everyone who tried them commented on how good they were.  She used milk chocolate chips instead of the simisweet, just because she didn't know the difference.  I'm sure I'll make them again and will use simisweet.  Thank you for such a tasty and easy recipe!  My daughter was so proud of herself that she was able to make them with no help from me."
394077,48532,2007-05-11,5,Love it!!! Nice texture.  Crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the center.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.
265954,48532,2007-07-12,4,"These are good.  Definitely eat once cool, b/c anything with hot peanut butter is just not appetizing.  The cookies stay nice and soft and the chocolate stayed gooey even after the cookie cooled.  I didn't have chunky peanut butter, so I used creamy instead and just threw in some peanut halves.  Thanks for posting."
230557,48532,2007-08-07,3,I halved the recipe and got exactly 18 medium sized cookies.  These did not taste like traditional pb cookies - they didn't melt in the mouth.  And they took at least 12 minutes to bake.
520150,48532,2007-12-30,5,"So, So good!  DH said they were the best peanut butter cookies he has ever had.  Lovely recipe that I am sure to make again.  Soft & so good.  Thanks!"
91392,48532,2008-02-10,4,"I think I remember this as Mean Chef's recipe and it is a good one.  Quick and easy to make and everyone will like them.  I used a tiny cookie scoop and they flattened out well by themselves although they did take a biot longer to bake than I thought they would.  I got 45 small cookies, the perfect size recipe when you don't want bunches and bunches.  Will definitely make them again, very good."
620763,48532,2008-04-28,4,"Very tasty cookie, but mine looked nothing like the photos. They were really tiny as they did not spread at all, and were domed in the middle.  I would have preferred a flatter cookie.  Next time I will flatten them down before I bake them so they will cook more evenly."
92816,48532,2008-06-01,5,"I am eating one of these cookies now as I am writing this review.Simply amazing!I don't think any of these will make it to the freezer.
I used whole wheat flour in my recipe and smooth peanut butter.I baked mine for about 11 minutes and they were just getting golden but still soft & chewy.A great soft cookie recipe !!"
32058,48532,2008-09-11,5,These are incredible. I used Jif creamy as well and semi-sweet choc chips. Time was right on. TY for posting these are marvelous.
218535,48532,2008-09-22,5,These are very very good. Instructions are spot on. I got exactly 36 cookies.
184723,48532,2009-06-30,5,"Great cookies!  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips because that's all I had on hand.  The children absolutely devoured them in one day!  The next time I make these, I will flatten them down a bit because they didn't flatten at all while baking... but very rich and good.  My husband said they tasted like reeses pieces!  Thanks!"
637486,48532,2009-08-22,5,Holy Cow!!!  These cookies were amazing.  It was the perfect combination on peanut butter and chocolate.  I used half smooth and half chunky peanut butter and then semi sweet chocolate chunks.  They took about 11 minutes to bake and I had to let them cool on the cookie sheet about 3 minutes before I could transfer them to the cooling rack.  This is definitely going in the save file.  Thanks again!
140806,48532,2009-10-02,5,These are great little cookies. I used light  brown sugar and chocolate chips with no problems. I also learned a trick to lightly toss the chocolate chips with a little flour so the chips don't sink to the bottom of the cookie. It works very well. The only problem with this recipe is that the cookies magically disappear after baking!
140132,48532,2011-03-14,4,"These are really good.  I love peanut butter cookies and add in the chocolate chunks......delicious.  I was a little concerned with how undone these looked when coming out of the oven but they we good once cooled down.  When we tried eating them right out of the oven they fell apart.  No worries, these are too good when cooled to not make again.  Thank you P4"
377039,145064,2007-12-03,5,Absolutely outstanding. I've never been able to get the 'knack' of gravy making -- until now. This was the best gravy I've ever tasted.  Thank you Kittencal!
52543,145064,2005-11-16,5,"This is also the way my mom & I make our gravy! Like Nana Lee, we simmer the ""uneatable parts"" with chopped onions in water  to make a broth. At step 7, I also add some dry white wine. Thanx Kitten! "
37305,145064,2005-11-25,5,"Excellent gravy and easy to make!  I used the fat from the turkey roaster instead of butter and the turkey drippings instead of chicken broth.  It came out just delicious and was the perfect complement to out Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks for sharing, Kitten!  "
229524,145064,2006-10-22,5,"Loved this gray.  Very tasty.  Was a tad to thick, but, adding the water helped to thin it out.  Really good flavor.  Did add some sage and thyme cause I like these spices in my gravy."
222055,145064,2006-11-23,5,"Looked wonderful and tasted great!!! Was easy to make and so very glad I did!!! Thank you again Kitten, for another Keeper!"
168462,145064,2007-07-31,5,"My boys say this is far better than canned gravy.I used the chicken broth option and instead of flour i used Bisto. It was a little salty(probably the Bisto), so I just added about a cup more broth. I found that it did not need the chicken boullion. Thanks for the recipe."
173579,145064,2007-10-21,5,Very good.  Quick and easy.  Will be using this a lot.  Thanks for posting.
312577,145064,2007-11-23,5,"Carol,  I used this gravy recipe with your turkey and brine recipies.  Perfect gravy.  I really have come to love and depend on you for amazing recipes.  I highly recommend this with your turkey and brine recipes.  I have permanently put them in my recipe books!  10 stars!!"
315055,145064,2008-03-31,1,"This looked really good, but I didn't try until the next day when I heated everything up.  The sauce was way too thick and tasted bad.  My hubby refused to try it.  I don't know if I would try again, but if I did I would make it less thick and eat the day of."
55578,145064,2008-09-25,5,"Well considering I didn't have much to work with, the gravy turned out great.  I had no pan drippings or chicken broth or bouillon, but did find some veggie bouillon (I was at my mom's).  We added some Kitchen Bouquet and worchestershire sauce to get some flavor.  Also garlic powder.  All and all Kitten you sure helped out our turkey dinner!"
774665,145064,2008-11-27,5,This made fantastic gravy and from now on this is my gravy. I added 1 cup of white wine. Delish!
203325,145064,2008-11-28,5,This was perfect gravy.  My daughter whipped this up for Thanksgiving dinner and it was almost as good as Grandma's!
132383,145064,2008-11-29,5,"Another winner from Kittencal!! We are not real gravy eaters and we weren't sure how this would turn out with drippings from a Puerto Rican Turkey (pavochon)....it was fabulous.  We only had 1/2 - 1 cup of drippings and used chicken stock to make up 2 cups (as we halved the recipe).  We made this the day after when Turkey tends to be a little drier...wow, I was just amazed.  Thanks!"
173314,145064,2008-12-02,5,awesome and delicious. easy too
93006,145064,2008-12-26,5,"Absolutely just what I was looking for.  Simple, traditional, perfect flavor and couldn't have been easier to make.  I used half tsp. finely ground pepper and the gravy was perfectly, subtly flavored."
373817,145064,2009-01-03,5,This is perfect! Thanks for helping me make such a yummy gravy!
125640,145064,2009-02-02,5,"I made turkey gravy from the pan drippings. The flavor was a bit off for me, but that was a problem with the drippings; the method worked out great. Thanks for sharing."
100526,145064,2009-02-24,5,"Delicious! Your recipe has taken the fear out of gravy making for me. I followed the recipe exactly as written and had wonderful gravy on Christmas day!

Thanks for another wonderufl recipe!"
50969,145064,2009-06-15,5,"I made this recipe on 6/14/09 with the drippings from Recipe#104965. And I did make a mistake with this recipe, I only made half :).The recipe was sort of made as written, I used 1 cup of drippings. And then added 1/2 cup chicken broth and the rest water.Proceeded with the rest of the recipe as it was written. And have to tell you, this is some of the best gravy. I will make this recipe anytime turkey gravy is needed. Thanks for posting and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
140132,145064,2009-11-09,5,"Perfect gravy!  I used some chicken broth that I had frozen from another time added that to the drippings and it turned out perfect.  This is so simple I don't know why I didn't think of this before!  I plan on using this all the time,  Thank you so much for sharing this with me, now I have perfect gravy!!!!!!"
316717,145064,2009-11-26,5,makes making gravy so easy! will make it this way from now on! thank you!
359220,145064,2009-11-26,5,"This is a rock star recipe- as in, it makes me look like a rock star, Kitten!  Very quick to make right before sitting down to feast today.  I had about 2 cups of drippings so I added 2 cups of stock and lots of black pepper (also about 1/2 tsp salt) and delish!  Thick, rich and perfect atop creamy mashed potatoes and juicy turkey....this will be my go to gravy all during the year due to its simplicity and great taste.  Another Kittencal winner!"
347822,145064,2009-11-28,5,"Good recipe! Once I collected the turkey the drippings, the gravy was made in 10 minutes top. As always, thank you Kittencal for the posting."
142335,145064,2009-12-02,5,Made exactly as written. This was so good I could drink it. I love me some gravy!!!
400420,145064,2009-12-06,5,Perfect gravhy!  Doubled the recipe and it worked out just right!  You just can't go wrong with a Kittencal recipe!  Thanks for another keeper!!
1072593,145064,2009-12-25,5,I'm thinking I'm going to have to follow you around just to take notes.  You are one bad self.
187373,145064,2010-08-22,5,Quick and easy. Made it from the drippings of a turkey my DH smoked on the Green Egg. I did make a half recipe and needed some chicken broth to make up the rest.  But turned out great with a little smoky taste from the drippings.  Thanks for posting!
135887,145064,2010-11-30,5,My teenage daughter made this while I prepared other Thanksgiving dishes.  It was delicious.  She used pan drippings and about 1 cup of chicken broth to get enough liquid.  Very good!
532289,145064,2011-02-17,5,"Another winner by Kitten.  I wasn't surprised when I searched for gravy, sorted by most popular and Kitten's name came up. Made as directed.  It is wonderful.  Wouldn't change a thing, Thanks for all your great recipes."
242484,145064,2011-11-26,5,Made this for our Thanksgiving meal this year and it was so good and incredibly quick and easy.  Got lots of compliments on it being the best gravy people had ever tasted!
789516,145064,2012-01-31,5,"I only had a 1.5lb turkey breast so I only got about 1 cup of drippings.  I scaled the recipe back to 2, and added 1 cup of broth.  This was an awesome, quick gravy.  Thanks:)"
470351,145064,2012-10-21,5,"A fool-proof recipe that delivers a HECK of a bang!    I added 1/4 cup of water and the water mixed with the drippings the turkey breast made in the crockpot got me about 2 cups of drippings.  I offset the remaining amount of gravy with chicken stock.  I used A TON of fresh ground black pepper and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  I'll admit, I did have to add a bit of Wondra to thicken this to my liking,  Excellent flavor and consistency.  This is my go-to gravy recipe for chicken and turkey."
13796,145064,2012-11-21,5,Thanks again Kittencal...   I tripled this recipe using the 1/2 cup of butter... some of the rendered fat from the turkey.. and the turkey broth and potato water from boiling the potatoes for the mashed potatoes. Instead of flour I used Jiffy Buttermilk Baking Mix (Bisquick).
2549237,145064,2013-03-31,4,"This was good, but I had a problem with lumps too.  I mixed the flour into a water slurry too.  I will continue to try until I get it right because the flavor was great.  I made mine using beef broth."
1179225,145064,2015-09-24,5,"So, so good! I&#039;m really glad we tried this perfect gravy. We did cut back on the butter by about half and it was perfect for us. Thanks so much for posting! Update: made a veggie version using veggie broth added a tiny bit of poultry seasoning and some white pepper. Loved it! Thanks!"
103876,69630,2004-01-01,5,"Wonderful!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Everyone should try this cake.  The dense, but moist texture was just what I was hoping for and the flavor was totally like wedding cake.  I made this for a new year's eve party/my husband's birthday and everyone loved it.  And I can't believe the low amount of fat - tastes so much richer.  This will be my standard cake from now on.  Thanks so much for a terrific recipe!"
146486,69630,2004-08-23,5,I made this for an office birthday party and it was delicious.  I made half the recipe and it made 3 big layers.  Thank you for a great recipe!!
56087,69630,2006-03-04,5,"I decided to use this recipe for my Grandsons birthday.  It was everything I expected it to be.  Perfect for decortating, yet moist and delicious!  A perfect way to step up a box mix.  I'll be using this everytime I need a white cake.
Thanks for sharing."
37036,69630,2006-04-25,5,"Very good!  I tried the ""chocolate"" version on the recipe.  I made no changes to the recipe and used a butter cream frosting.  Everyone loved the moist, light textured cake.  I can't wait to try the white cake next.  Thanks Donna M. for a great recipe!"
121185,69630,2006-06-14,5,"I wish I couyld give this more stars!  I used this recipe to fill a wilton character cake pan and I had enough batter left for about 20+ cupcakes.  There were a few cake bakers at the party and they each wanted this recipe - everyone else raved about it!  (I did use vanilla extract though...and no almond)  It was dense, yet light, and incredibly moist.  Thanks you sooo much!  (Goes great with your buttercream!)"
250031,69630,2006-07-31,5,"Wonderful, moist, delicious cake. My family was very impressed. My daughter said she could only HOPE to be as good a cook as I. Thanks for the recipe! I used a buttercream frosting and halved the recipe for a 13x9 pan. Baked for about 36 minutes."
307214,69630,2006-10-09,5,"Made the white version in a 16x10 pan (didn't measure pan so guessing the size).  It was wonderful and meet with raves from my company.  I goofed and added the entire sour cream container (used 3 cups instead of 2 cups), so there was a stronger sour cream flavour but the cake was still great.  DS kept mentioning ""baked potatoes"" while he ate it but he did have 3 pieces!  Iced it with #26252 Mare's Most Delicious Icing (brown sugar option and 1 1/2 recipe).  Made a special Birthday cake for a very special lady.  Thanks for the great recipe."
278113,69630,2006-10-29,5,"5 stars is not enough!! I made this for a friends birthday cake, and everyone raved! I made a 1/2 batch and it was perfect for two rounds, with a bit left over (which made a nice little cake for us to sample!!) I also made your extra special buttercream frosting, which was fabulous as well. Thanks for sharing this outstanding recipe, I know it will be used often!"
58836,69630,2006-11-08,5,"Made this yesterday for a church function.  The cake was really good although the icing I used didn't turn out good for some reason, therefore the cake kinda tasted funny too.  Next time I make this I'll be sure to have a better icing.  Thanks"
137911,69630,2007-02-15,5,"All I can say is I'm sooooo glad I found this recipe!!! It's one of the best cakes I've ever had/made. I made it for my dh's birthday last Saturday and it was such a great texture...not that fluffy, spongy airy cakes you get from a straight box mix. I look forward to trying many other flavors with this method!!! I halved the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 glass dish. Baked it at the 325 for about 40 minutes. Thanks for posting this!! ~ Update ~ I've made this cake about 5 times since my original review.  It is now a requested family favorite.  My dd wanted to make it for her Dad for Valentine's Day this week.  Turned out great as usual. Pam"
173579,69630,2007-04-04,5,This was a fantastic recipe.  I made this for my son's birthday.  He really did enjoy it.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
185285,69630,2007-10-22,5,"My best friend and her DH adore white cake and for her Baby Shower, I decided this was worth a shot.  I'm so glad I chose this recipe as a beginner with cake-making!  It makes the most user-friendly, forgiving and scrumptious cake EVER! I was tempted to leave out the almond extract in fear that it would be overpowering, however after reading the reviews I opted to leave it in - and am very glad I did.  Here, it adds a richness rather than a truly distinct flavor.  To make it simple, I did a basic 2-layer cake using Recipe #69633 and topped my cake with Recipe #58687 and filled in creases with chocolate chips.  It looked (and tasted!) great!"
132383,69630,2007-11-10,5,Loved this recipe. I made cupcakes with this recipe and used chocolate buttercream frosting to top them.
222055,69630,2007-11-21,5,I made this cake and used your Recipe #69633 recipe. It was a wonderful cake. I made it for my sisters b-day and used the Betty Crocker mix that had rainbow sprinkles in it. Thank you so much for both of the marvelous recipes!!!
140132,69630,2008-01-08,5,"I made this for DD's birthday.  We loved the almond flavoring in this.  It is such a beautiful cake and moist....yummy.  I will definately make this again as it turned out perfect.......thanks, Stephanie"
218535,69630,2008-02-29,4,This cake is both moist and sturdy (which is almost an irony). I did not give it 5 stars because it tastes too almond-y for my liking.
400708,69630,2008-03-02,4,"Thanks Donna for a gread recipe.  I cut it in half (didn't have THAT many people coming) for a birthday cake for my DGS.  Was making a snow boarding mountain and wanted to make sure it wouldn't collapse under the weight.  It turned out perfect, the directions were easy to follow and the taste was lovely.  Thanks for posting."
32058,69630,2008-09-11,4,"After reading the multitude of reviews I had to try it.  Although a good cake, it was not as moist as I had hoped.   Perhaps my expectations were too high."
232480,69630,2008-11-01,5,"SO very good!  I used this to make my son's 1st birthday cake - I wanted it to be easy but not taste like a boxed mix, and this was perfect for that!  The cake got rave reviews all around, this was just great, thank you so much.  I made 1/2 a recipe, which fit a 2 layer shaped cake pan from Wilton perfectly with a bit left over for a very tiny loaf pan.  I will DEFINITELY keep this recipe for future birthdays!"
18391,69630,2009-05-04,5,"An excellent recipe. I used French Vanilla  Cake Mix and halved the recipe, and baked in 13x9 pan. The batter was a bit too much so I made a few cupcakes. My husband loved it!"
520150,69630,2009-05-05,5,This cake was such a hit with my friends!  I was compared to the favorite local baker that everyone uses for special occasions.  There was not a drop left over.  Thank you very much - I will use this again & again!
126440,69630,2009-05-21,5,I took this to a potluck and it got rave reviews.  Very easy to do and the flavor is great. I did make half a recipe and used a 15 X 10 inch jelly roll pan and baked for 23 min.  I used Recipe #282040 for the frosting.
176615,69630,2009-07-10,5,"Made a half-recipe using 2 9-inch round pans for my son's birthday cake. As easy as a boxed cake mix but with better flavor, moist, dense, and stands up well to decorating. Can't wait to try the chocolate and lemon versions as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe! UPDATE: Have also made the chocolate version, this time used three 9-inch round pans for a triple layer cake. Worked really well, a nice moist cake that frosts easily."
172369,69630,2010-02-08,5,"Love this cake, made as directed, thank you for sharing."
316717,69630,2010-08-19,4,the kids and my husband enjoyed it. i only chose this recipe because i was looking for a recipe to use 8 egg whites i had. didn't want to throw it away so found this. should've just made fried rice w/ the left over egg whites because of course this recipe makes a ton. but i shared some w/ the neighbors and they loved it too.
1133190,69630,2010-12-08,0,"Yum! I got numerous compliments on this cake. It was moist, and dense enough to cut and decorate.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it used an actual box of cake mix.  I'd love to be able to make a cake like this completely from scratch.  I halved the recipe and it turned out perfect.  Thanks!"
81611,69630,2011-11-13,0,"Good. Mine turned out very, very dense, but then again, I changed a couple things. If I could do things over I would use 3 9x13 pans instead of 2. It makes so much cake! I will try this again for a crowd, definitely. The cake bottoms were so nice and firm for frosting."
8629,69630,2014-04-19,3,"I cut the recipe in half.  One half recipe made 32 mini cupcakes, a 10&quot; x 15&quot; pan and about 9 regular size cupcakes.  I thought the cake by itself was not very flavorful. But once I added a nice cream cheese frosting, the flavors all came together."
1179225,69630,2016-06-30,5,"Soooo delicious! Light but rich. I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for just shy of an hour. I think I could have taken it out about 5 mins sooner, the edges got a little tough. I cut the cake in half and froze half. I split the other half and iced the center with PB icing and iced the entire cake with buttercream icing. Delicious! I'm looking forward to trying all sorts of variations of this keeper recipe. Thanks for sharing."
9869,13982,2001-12-19,4,"Really nice flavour combination, I wrapped the salmon in foil and baked in the oven, very tender."
37636,13982,2002-04-24,5,"Mmmmm....this was delicious! I cooked this one outdoors over charcoal, it turned it great! The honey gives a delicate sweetness without being overpowering. I love grilled fish, it's so healthy for you. Great dinner, with no leftovers! Thanks, Mirjam! :)"
229850,128956,2006-01-13,5,"Love this soup. What makes it worth more than 5 stars is if you are a wieght watcher, there are not many things out there this good for 0 points. Got this from my WW leader, and have been making it ever since."
46660,128956,2006-01-18,4,"It gets four stars for being zero points, but honestly, the flavor left much to be desired.  It was really bland, and I used fresh herbs.  I think I might try as another poster did and add some ginger to it to liven it up some.  I will update this review if I find a way to 'kick it up.'  "
227607,128956,2006-10-19,5,"I made this today but did it in my crockpot.  It turned out wonderful.  I am going to freeze it in individual portions to take out for lunch and before dinner.
UPDATE!!!!! I have been eating this for lunch out of the freezer baggies and it is wonderful even after being frozen.  I have another batch in my crockpot right now but this time I added yellow squash instead of zucchini and more garlic.  This is wonderful and so healthy since I am now trying to lower my cholesterol."
91392,128956,2007-10-29,3,"I really wanted to like this more than we did.  Needs some spicing up, but very easy to do and very healthy too."
252816,128956,2008-03-05,5,"This is a recipe you can play with.I do not saute veggies,I just throw everything into the soup pot and let the flavors simmer.You can fudge with ingredients and amounts as desired.I did not have zucchini on hand and omitted  tomato paste as I used leftover tomato ingredients.I did increase beef bouillion broth to 5 cups,actually 10 cups as I doubled.I have made beef cabbage soup by adding leftover roast beef and some leftover gravy. I have also made a spicy cabbage soup (i used half a head of cabbage)using leftover carnita pork #25621 and by adding 2tsp. fuego spice which is 1/4 cup paprika,2 tsp cayanne pepper,2 tsp white pepper,2tblsp oregano,chile powder,garlic powder,salt,pepper.yields one cup,store in airtight container for future mexican meals..Also I keep a freezer bag in my freezer that is a catch all for all leftover tomato sauce,tomatoes-canned and fresh leftovers.I had about 2 cups I tossed in the soup.Also added 3/4 cup celery and 2 cups carrots and a drained can of green beans..Nice spicy cabbage soup..I always double this recipe..."
222970,128956,2008-07-13,5,Wonderful soup. You would never know it was healthy!
470351,128956,2008-08-06,5,"I've become the queen of grazing/munching lately while cooking and have been looking for food to eat that won't be unhealthy when these grazing episodes hit.  I came across this while searching for other recipes and decided to give it a try...I'm so glad I did!  DELICIOUS!!  Super flavorful!  I do worry about all the sodium but next time I will find lower sodium options to use in place of the broth.  I followed the recipe closely, doubled the recipe, omitted the green beans (I hate them!) and subbed great northern beans in their place.  I increased the onion and the garlic and put in a teeny bit more tomato paste than called for.  WONDERFUL!!!  Super tasty! Thank you for posting!"
350750,128956,2008-12-26,5,"Another five stars.  This soup is delicious, it's even better the next day! Thanks for a great recipe."
142559,128956,2009-01-04,5,"VERY good and VERY filling! I did change a few things, nothing major: omitted the zucchini (store didn't have any), no basil, added mushrooms and red pepper flakes for a little kick (maybe a little too much, but it is still good!). Thanks for posting, I needed this!!!! Update: have been adding baby bok choy to this soup and it is delish! You really can add whatever veggies you like!"
362983,128956,2009-03-15,5,"Simple yet delicious. I made pretty much a double batch and have lots for the rest of the week! I left out the green beans since I didn't have any, and added celery as well. Very versatile recipe. I made mine quite peppery since that's the way we like it :) I followed other suggestions of sauteing all the vegetables together along with the spices and tomato paste first, then adding the broth at the end. I let it simmer for about a half hour after that and it was perfect. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!"
914720,128956,2009-05-16,5,"This is great for 0 points.  I made a double batch using 4c vegetable broth and 14 ounces diced tomatoes, and omitted the tomato paste.  I also used frozen green beans that I had on hand.  I'll stash half in the freezer, and use the rest this week.  Thanks for posting!"
54678,128956,2009-09-10,5,Need to use up a freezer full of broths and so I used pork broth and your recipe.
318235,128956,2010-01-13,3,"This was pretty good, but just not a wow for us. Thank you for the recipe though."
1133190,128956,2010-06-16,4,For a low calorie soup it's pretty good.  I just felt like it was missing substance.  Maybe some kidney beans or even a few more varieties of vegetables would be nice. I could see this being a nice soup to eat when you are sick and don't want much substance.
58836,128956,2011-02-18,4,Made this yesterday morning to take to work for lunch.  Was quick and easy.  Didn't have beef broth but just used 3 cups of water with 3 boullion cubes.  Was very good.  I'm sure I will make again.
226863,128956,2010-10-09,5,"This is very good!  I've made cabbage soup for diets with chicken stock, but the beef stock added a whole new dimension.  Loved the suggestions posted by others....adding beans, etc, but I made this recipe to fill me up and not add calories or carbs.  I chose not to use the zucchini, and subbed spinach.  Perfection!  I'll try adding some mushrooms next time, because I think they would be great in this."
32058,128956,2011-01-12,5,I doubled this too.  Great aroma while it is cooking! Subbed brocolli for zuccini and added some greek seasoning and extra dill.
103876,128956,2011-08-12,5,This soup is so great for weight watchers.  It is very filling and so healthy.  I'm sure I will be making this often.  Thanks for posting!
844554,128956,2011-09-28,5,Yummy! Yummy! I used beef and veggie broth (to use up the cans). I left out the carrots and tomato paste. I made a BIG pot of this to eat all week for breakfast and lunch. It's surprising how tasty it is. I used Italian seasoning. Thanks for posting this one!!
653438,128956,2011-11-06,5,"Delicious!  Fixed this as written only adding some left over corn, a stalk of celery and kidney beans...it was so good on a rainy cool day.  Served it with a side salad and bread.  Made for November TOTM Diabetes forum."
140132,128956,2012-02-11,4,"I made this soup, only adding some ground turkey to it. ( I know it doesn't make it 0 pts.) but my family eats it better with some meat.  It was really good.  I will continue to make, thankyou for sharing."
199020,128956,2012-04-22,5,Wow! We were pleasantly surprised at how good this was! We'll definitely be having it often. Thanks!
482376,128956,2013-01-17,4,"Great soup! I enjoyed the variety of veggies, the ease of preparation and the flavor. Most of all, I loved the health factor. I did find that I needed to add about 1 more cup of liquid. Thanks so much for posting!"
2549237,128956,2013-01-23,4,This soup is really good.  I followed the recipe as written except I added crushed red pepper.  Will make again.  Thanks!
203111,128956,2013-04-27,4,"After making this again yesterday, I&#039;m now revising my previous review from 2 stars to 4.  I think the reason I didn&#039;t like it the first time I made it is that I had followed the instructions and cooked my garlic much too long..I suppose it burned, which gave the entire soup a bad taste.  This time I sauteed onion and carrots in extra virgin olive oil for about 5 minutes, THEN added the garlic and cooked only til the garlic was fragrant.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe using the beef broth and it turned out to be quite good, as well as quick, easy and very nutritious.   And the next day, it was even tastier.   I&#039;m so glad I gave this soup another chance...I&#039;ll definitely be making it regularly."
98919,128956,2014-03-05,5,"I have tried the original WW soup and had to force myself to eat it. This was a much tastier version - you are right, BEEF broth is better! I saut&eacute;ed my cabbage and used spinach and diced mushrooms in place of the carrots and zucchini. I am not a huge fan of oregano, so next time I might try a little thyme, sage and/or rosemary. Thanks for posting!!"
218535,128956,2014-11-30,4,I prefer a variation of the WW soup (Recipe #278655). Thus the 4 stars.
142367,128956,2015-04-02,5,"Wow, this was amazing soup!  With the ww title I was skeptical on how good it could be, but this one is going in my keeper file.  Thank you for sharing!"
400708,128956,2015-08-19,4,"Loved this dageret, I followed the direction exactly (except for Zucchini as I had none) and it was great for lunch, then I decided to try it for a base for dinner and added a potatoe with some left over port - still healthy and low in fat and it was great.  Served it with my sage rolls and it made for a hearty, warm and satisfying dinner.  I can imagine a lot of things could be added, but I like it just as written for when those HUNGRIES strike.  Update: August, 2015.  Continue to use this just as written, though I do double it then freeze in batches to handle those times when hunger strikes or just a a lovely fall dinner with a slice of home made bread and a class of red wine - Yum and not bad on the calorie side"
1581225,128956,2016-11-08,5,This is my fave veggie soup. It's so tasty but so easy. A keeper.
39835,13982,2004-03-22,5,Delicious - followed the recipe exactly but cooked the salmon in the oven (baking it at 425 using the same time as indicated) instead of grilling. Marinade is delicioius and I think it will be wonderful on chicken also just increasing the marinating time. Thanks for sharing.
103876,13982,2004-06-04,5,"This was a very tasty recipe. I was out of orange juice so used pineapple instead. The marinade was just right for the salmon.  I will defintely make again.
"
54678,13982,2005-08-08,5,This was a great dish and we followed the suggestion to wrap in foil with the marinade but we also did a pc of salmon grilled directly on the bbq and both were great. I'm sure the leftovers will be awesome sitting in the marinade
255338,13982,2007-04-15,5,"Salmon is expensive where I live, so if I were to try out a new salmon recipe, it had better be worth the cost. This one was fantastic. I used fresh minced ginger and garlic, and followed the advice of grilling on foil. My children loved this one. Thank you very much for this recipe."
368078,13982,2007-07-13,5,"yumm!!  We made just as posted and it was wonderful.  We cooked ours on foil, just to be safe (we didn't want our wonderful salmon falling through the grates of the grill :), and it turned out amazing!  We can't wait to share this recipe with others.  Thanks!"
182624,13982,2008-01-05,5,"So healthy and yet so delicious!  I baked in the oven for 20 minutes at 450; came out great!  Served alongside grilled veggies and white rice to round out a nice healthy meal.  This one goes in the keeper file!  Thanks, Mirj!"
265954,13982,2008-01-29,0,"I'm not rating this recipe b/c I tweaked it and it came out awful, so I'm warning others not to do what I did!!  It's 35 degrees where I am today, so I did not grill this, but used a Foreman grill, instead.  I made the marinade as directed, marinaded for 1 hour, then grilled in the Foreman for 2 minutes at 340, saw it was getting burned, so dropped the temperature to 300 and grilled for 5 more minutes with the cover up, pouring the marinade over the salmon in the meantime.  The salmon was fishy and dry the way I cooked it.  I've made Mirj's recipes before, so I'm sure that had I made the recipe as directed, it would have been delicious!!"
185926,13982,2008-03-05,4,"I used fresh ginger and added black pepper on Coho Salmon. I squeezed one orange and got 1/3 cup of juice. The sauce was delicious. It was too cold to grill so I broiled the fish in the oven. I used non-stick aluminum foil and put extra marinate on the fish to cook down to a sauce. The sauce when cooked down in the pan was syrupy and delicious, I soaked my bread in it, yummy.  I would have given it five stars if the ginger and garlic called for were fresh.  Thank you."
8688,13982,2008-05-28,5,"The marinade is perfectly balanced for this flavorful grilled salmon. I grilled this over a cedar plank, adding its own touch of flavor which blended well with the marinade. Not too overly sweet, just right!  Thanks for another wonderful supper, Mirj!"
218535,13982,2008-06-23,5,Wonderful. The best Salmon recipe on recipezaar.
92886,13982,2008-07-01,4,"I liked that this was lightly sweet but well balanced with the citrus and soy.  I put my fish in a small baking dish, poured all the marinade over the fish and baked it at 375 for about 25 minutes.  Once done, I spoon some of the marinade over the fish."
207176,13982,2008-09-13,5,Great Salmon!  I had this tonight at my friend Spamster's house.  She said she makes it all the time and I told her I would rate it from all of us.  She used wild salmon and crushed garlic and fresh ginger.  She grilled it and even the kids all liked it.  I will make this in the future.  Thanks for another great recipe!
394077,13982,2009-02-15,5,"My goodness, this recipe is awesome.  We marinated the salmon in the sauce for 30 minutes.  Took the salmon and broiled it for 5 minutes until it was lightly charred but not burnt though.  Then we boiled  the marinate in a pan so the sauce thicken a bit.  Pour it over the salmon.  Served with mashed potatoes.  To Die For and so easy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. No more thick and tasteless salmon thanks to Mirj. :)"
126440,13982,2009-05-03,5,Excellent salmon.  Very easy and quick to do.  My fillets were very thin so didn't take long at all.  Served it with Recipe #5418.
174991,13982,2009-06-26,5,"Not that needs another review, but it deserves it.  Wonderful flavor and very moist.  I baked it instead of grilling it.  Next time I'll grill it."
146047,13982,2009-07-05,5,"Nice recipe-- simple and quick, even with fresh garlic. Just be careful when you grill it not to let it go too long on the cut side. Mine got just a shade too seared after 6 min. Oops! My bad. :)"
231054,13982,2009-09-16,5,Oh YUM!!!!  What wonderful flavor --it totally compliments the salmon.  And our salmon turned out very moist and tender.  I actually did ours in the oven -- wrappen in foil (after marinating).  I cooked it about 15 minutes at 425 -- unwrapped the foil and put it under the broiler for about  2 minutes.  We loved it.  I'm hoping to give it a try on the barbecue grill -- but hubby is a little apprehensive about doing fish on the grill!!!  Thank you for sharing an amazing recipe.
199020,13982,2010-01-22,5,"Best salmon I've ever eaten! I didn't have any orange juice, but the marinade was fabulous without it! Thanks!"
158086,13982,2010-04-24,5,Wonderful Salmon....we really enjoyed it...I served it with a caesar salad and corn & pepper orzo....
847160,13982,2010-06-22,5,i marinated for 2 days .. cook it on the BBQ ..... and wow that was super good ..thanks
470351,13982,2010-09-05,3,Good. Used fresh garlic.  Tasty.
173579,13982,2010-09-23,5,This salmon was very good.  Excellent flavor.  Thanks for posting.
68460,13982,2011-01-18,5,"We loved this!  I used freshly grated ginger in place of the powder.  Our grill is covered with a foot and a half of snow so I baked this at 350° for 15 minutes, basting once halfway through.  It was perfect!  Thanks Mirj for the lovely recipe!"
176615,13982,2011-06-16,5,"Yummy! Made an easy, healthy and delicious dinner. Baked in the oven instead of the grill. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
145352,13982,2011-07-10,5,This gave the salmon a great flavor!
222564,13982,2012-02-22,5,So delicious and simple. I reduced the leftover marinade and served on the side.
198154,13982,2016-04-14,4,"We used local wildflower honey and reduced sodium soy sauce.  We started it on the gas grill, but ran out of propane and had to finish it in the oven.  It turned out fantastic. Served with couscous and steamed asparagus."
92816,88939,2004-04-30,5,"This is a nice chicken marinade,not too overpowering.I made some alterations because I was only using 2 chicken breasts.I did not use the full 1 cup of oil only about 4 tbsp.For the rest of the ingredients I halved each amount."
64203,88939,2004-10-20,5,Wow! This is the best chicken marinade I've tried. Wonderful full flavor with a little bit of zip. Easy to put together and delicious! I also halved the recipe because I was only making 3 chicken breasts. My entire family loved this! Thanks!
53932,88939,2005-05-07,5,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars to this recipe.  This may be the best marinade ever!  Like Luuvbunny, I used 4 Tbl oil and halved the remaining ingredients.  I marinated the chicken for about 8 hours and brushed marinade on the chicken throughout cooking.  Thanks for sharing!  It's a keeper."
147109,88939,2005-06-01,5,"This was such a great marinade.  I halved the recipe because it was just for my husband and I. I can't wait to try it with some veggies next time.  I made a few changes/errors as I did not have any worcestershire sauce, and I forgot to half the pepper. I also just just garlic salt and omitted regular salt.  It was indeed finger licking, thanks so much!"
52543,88939,2005-07-11,5,"There's little I can add to the previous reviews - this stuff is wonderful! I used fresh garlic, scaled the quantities in half, then marinated 5 skinless bone-in breasts overnight in a large ziplock freezer bag. Grilled to perfection by my husband, they were moist & delicious. Thanx Edith!"
173314,88939,2005-09-03,5,Delicious flavor. Only change made was reducing salt and pepper to 1 tsp. each.  Similar to Chiavetta's Marinade which is very popular in New York State.
199020,88939,2006-03-25,5,"This was a really good marinade.  It reminded me somewhat of Italian dressing.  I let the chicken marinate for about an hour before cooking it, and it had good flavor. Next time I think I will let it marinate longer.  Thanks for the recipe."
160974,88939,2006-03-27,5,"I'm glad I  saw this listed in the ""favorite five recipes"" thread. This really tasted like a ""bistro-style"" chicken. The thyme really makes it. I used a white balsamic vinegar.  I halved the recipe and used 4 medium chicken breasts and seared in butter and then finished baking for about 20 minutes. This is one of my favorite chicken recipes ever. Served with smashers and salad with feta and balsamic dressing.Thanks Echo, Echo!

47907,88939,2006-08-19,5,WOW!  We LOVED this marinade!  I made as posted and marinated chicken leg quarters for several hours in the fridge then grilled for about 45 minutes.  The end result is awesome.  This is my new favorite marinade.  Thanks so much for posting!!!
447123,88939,2007-03-04,5,Oh my gosh I have made this at least 3 times and have not yet rated it. (Please forgive me) Ladies and gentlemen.............You have to make this!! THis was a big old slam dunk in my house. I was afraid of the thyme but I went for it and added it all. WOW it really is just so great. a definent keeper. Like PP sugested I used balsamic vinegar and yuumy it was!! Thanks echo
248023,88939,2007-09-05,4,"A very tasty marinade... I used bone in thighs and olive oil and Hellman's mayo ( no Miracle Whip) and the rest of the seasonings as written.  The chicken turned out really juicy and the skin was absolutely delicious.  However, next time, I think I am going to experiment with the amount of olive oil and see with how little of an amount I can get away with... Thanks for posting!"
218535,88939,2008-05-19,4,This is not bad but I'd cut down the salt to 1/2 tablespoon.
426903,88939,2008-08-02,5,"This marinade can definitely be classified as ""finger licking good!"" My sister had made this for me, and her preference is to avoid the Worcestershire Sauce. I wanted to try it with it and see what the difference was. Both ways are fabulous!!! So if you have no Worcestershire Sauce, don't fret!! Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!!!"
207176,88939,2008-09-20,4,"Good chicken.  I marinated cubed chicken breasts and skewered them.  My youngest son thought it was too strong tasting.  I made the recipe as stated and for the oil I used corn oil and plain white vinegar and low fat mayo. DH and I liked the strong, tangy taste."
142335,88939,2008-11-12,4,This was good but it didn't wow me. I halved the recipe and used mayo. I let it marinate for 5 hours then grilled the chicken. I forgot to take a picture but it presented nicely. I'm glad I tried it. Thanks Echo!
173579,88939,2009-05-30,5,Fantastic!  This marinade will dazzle your taste buds.  Best I've ever had.  We loved the thyme in it.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
620763,88939,2009-08-06,5,"This is a great marinade. I left my chicken in the marinade for about  2 hours and it was flavorful, juicy, and tender."
33159,88939,2009-09-13,4,"This is quite good!  Great flavour & juicy chicken.  I marinated boneless, skinless chicken overnight.  I omitted the salt but used the garlic salt - I think it would have been too salty for us if we'd used the salt, too."
177933,88939,2009-09-16,5,"Loved this!!  Made exactly as directed on boneless, skinless thighs."
50969,88939,2009-09-19,4,"On 9/18/09 I needed a marinade for Recipe#58952. So a search was made and I came found this one, and decided to try it. And I'm really glad I did :) Since I didn't need alot, only half of this was made. Instead of using the garlic salt, garlic powder was substituted. The chicken breast strips were marinated for about 6 hours. This recipe made my chicken very moist, with a very good flavor. Thank you for posting and, ""Keep Smiling :) """
333017,88939,2009-12-10,3,"I am on the fence with this one.  I found it was definately on the salty side.  Now, that may be my fault as I had used M&M frozen chicken, which has alot of sodium in it.  I cut the recipe in half as I only had 4 chicken breast and as I did hot have the garlic salt, I used garlic powder and 1 tsp salt. That being said, I thought it was OK...nothing special!  Sorry, but I will probably pass on this one"
198154,88939,2010-02-22,4,"It ended up being a beautiful spring like day today. So we wanted to make some of the winter blues melt away and grill outside. I was looking for a marniade that didn't need to soak all day or over night. I didn't feel the need to use salt in addition to the garlic salt. This was perfect. Saved the day, and 4 stars from DH is a real big deal! I'll be using this one again!"
195589,88939,2010-05-10,5,"Yummm!! This stuff is great! I have made several times now and have used fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic salt. I also use Best Foods (Hellman's) mayo as I don't have Miracle Whip. One time I added about 1 tablespoon of dijon mustard (Gulden's) and it was over the top fantastic! I always marinade my foods in a large freezer baggie, so much easier that way, just turn it over every 15 minutes or so. Thanks for posting, echo."
64583,88939,2010-05-12,5,"This is delicious!  Flavorful marinades that aren't salty are my favorite to use.  This works perfectly.  I used apple-cider vinegar, omitted the thyme because I didn't have any, used only 1/2 tbl. of salt and used 1 tbl. of garlic powder instead of garlic salt.   I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they were juicy and tasted fantastic.  Thanks for posting :)"
632249,88939,2010-05-17,5,"Excellent chicken! I made a half recipe and it was plenty to coat about 8 pieces of chicken.  I baked for about 40 min, and then finished them on the grill. Everyone loved it. Thx!"
928301,88939,2011-03-19,5,"That's a great name for this.  I had no trouble with the mixing as Geca complained of.  Maybe the disappointed people's mistake has been marinating only 30 minutes because I marinated for a couple nights and my chicken was full of flavor. Maybe less time would've been equally as good, but I made the marinade ahead of time because I had my week's meals planned out. It was so good it made the pain of trying to stove cook chicken on the bone worth all the work."
140132,88939,2012-04-13,5,"Oh so good.  I used legs and thighs and it turned out fantastic.  I roasted them in the oven, but next time I want to grill them.....yummy.  The marinade made the chicken so flavorful and moist.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us."
839492,88939,2012-06-08,3,"While the marinade does impart a tender moist piece of chicken (I used boneless,skinless breasts), I didn't find the flavor particularly ""wow-ing"". I used fresh garlic, 1/2 t. salt and half the oil called for, this should've in no way compromised the flavor. I made this to go with Cheesy Chicken and Asparagus Bundles, which I thought would make them even more flavorful. Chicken itself was just ok."
389431,88939,2012-07-03,5,"This was delish!  Didn't have thyme, so I sub'ed some Mrs. Dash...  Perfect! Thanks so much!"
93006,35889,2003-10-29,5,"Not just tasty....perhaps the easiest rolls I have ever made, too!  I let them rise awhile, and wound up with 12 huge rolls!  So good, and especially a keeper due to the short turnaround time."
42720,35889,2003-03-01,4,"I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed your instructions for one rising.  The second time, I let it rise till doubled in bulk then punched it down and let it rise till double, again.  Both times, I baked the dough in a 9-inch loaf pan at 375 for about 20 minutes. It makes a very nice, large loaf.   I feel the second rising gave this bread a much better texture, but overall this is a very good, easily made bread recipe which works for rolls or a loaf.  Thanks, Yogi, for sharing.
"
47559,35889,2003-03-23,5,"I've become so spoiled by the bread machine, I didn't think I could make bread or rolls without it.  Wow, was I wrong.  This is soo easy! I did follow some of the review recommendations and let the rolls rise twice.  I cooked them on the pizza stone and they were beautiful and delicious.  I'll be making these often.  Thanks, Yogi."
52125,35889,2003-04-08,5,These are EXCELLENT!! I made these for my hamburgers and they were better in my opinion then store bought buns. Thanks for posting this recipe yogi!
26512,35889,2003-10-09,5,"Fantastic! Add me to the list of admirers, yogi!
I've never made ""homemade"" rolls before, but this looked easy enough for me to try. I actually forgot to take a loaf of frozen bread out of the freezer and decided I had to have some type of bread and I am so glad I forgot to take that bread out to thaw!
I just can't admire these enough! So simple and super fast! These remind me of my mother's Sourdough rolls...look out mom! Thanks for posting, yogi!"
18391,35889,2003-12-24,5,"Made this in my bread machine, wonderful! thanks"
59780,35889,2004-01-29,5,"I wish I could give these more than 5 stars! Who knew that you could make buns in less time than it would take to run to the store to get some?? I have made these twice now and with excellent results. The first time I made these, I foloowed the recipe exactly and the second time I used whole wheat flour and added wheat germ and ground flax. I also brushed the tops with recipe#17764 for a tasty topping. Thanks for this great recipe! I will be using it often!"
68960,35889,2004-02-09,5,"What more can I say, these are so very easy and turned out excellent.  I added flour until the dough was chewing gum consistancy, then like the other reviewers suggested, punched down and let rise for a 2nd time.  Since Easter isn't that far away I'm going to try making some using Hot Cross Bun spices and fruit.    "
64203,35889,2004-04-05,5,"We are having Sloppy Joes for dinner tonight and I forgot to buy buns at the store. I am so glad I ran across this recipe because it was so easy and much better than any bun I could have purchased at the store
Thank you so much for posting this fantastic bread recipe! Delicious and easy!!"
60992,35889,2004-04-12,5,"OH MY GOD!!!! I did it! I made rolls from scratch with yeast! And they were perfect! I followed the ideas of several other reviewers and add a generous squeeze of honey (DH loves the King Hawaiian rolls)and did an egg wash for a shiny coating. The flavor was fantastic, the texture fantastic (I again did the second rising per some reviewers suggestion) and made about 20 smaller rolls for dinner. I will make these again and again. Thanks Yogi for making me look so darned good!"
76951,35889,2004-05-22,5,"With 67 reviews, what can I say that hasn't already been said?  These are fantastic and SO easy. With ingredients that I almost always have on hand, it's easier to make from scratch than go to the grocery story (and obviously tastes better too).  Thanks, Yogi, for an outstanding recipe.  Definitely a keeper!"
255338,35889,2006-05-24,5,"Soooo good!! I did not have a proper electric mixer, just an old not so powerful handheld beater, and the bread still came out fluffy and tasty. I was so happy because I was never successful in making bread prior to this attempt. I used bread flour, and followed other reviewers advice and let the dough rise twice. Thank you for this one, Yogi."
222564,35889,2006-10-14,5,"Really nice buns, soft and light and slightly sweet. I used about 1/3 whole meal flour, as I usually tend to in bread recipes, and these where really good. We had them with sloppy joes and next day toasted for breakfast. Kept well up to next day, anyway."
39301,35889,2006-12-25,5,Very good and very easy.  My two small children just gobble these up!  I followed the recipe just as written and they turned out beautifully.  Thanks for posting.
92816,35889,2007-01-06,4,These are like the title says tasty buns.I took the advice of others and did 2 rises on these.I had a little trouble with getting them to rise the first time.I've never made bread before that called for the yeast and flour to be mixed together.The yeast is usually mixed with the warm liquid.I think that's how I would do it next time because this way the yeast does not dissolve.But once I made them into rolls I put them into a warm oven and they rose more.They turned out ok after that.
119466,35889,2007-01-29,5,"I've made these many times and was surprised when I noticed I've failed to review the recipe. They are easy and super quick--great for those times you'd like good, warm yeast rolls to accompany dinner, but have decided this at the last minute. I use instant yeast, give them an extra rise (they rise very quickly), and usually divide them into 16 rolls. I've subbed half whole-wheat flour, and have also used white whole-wheat flour. I do knead them for a few minutes, and I also bake them on parchment paper. This is a great recipe to introduce those who are not experienced with yeast and are intimidated by it--I've recommended it to a few people who fall into this category. It is basically a no-fail recipe and, as its title claims, a quite tasty one. Thanks for posting!"
312577,35889,2007-02-04,5,I finally succeeded at making a yeast roll!  I was so happy when I saw these beautiful fluffy rolls rise.  They are simple to make and delicious.  I used melted butter instead of the oil.
58836,35889,2007-05-06,5,"As if you need another rating on these buns!  Made them last night for a birthday supper.  They were very good and GONE!  I did let them rise a little longer and did a second rise as well.  I didn't even have the whole 2 packages of yeast, lacked just a tad and they rose perfectly.  Thanks, I'm sure I will make again.  I also added honey.  YUMMY!"
13796,35889,2007-06-30,5,I made half of the recipe this morning. They are very good.
447123,35889,2007-09-30,5,This was my very first attempt at making any buns. And boy did I knowc this one out of the park!!! DH uncle was here and kept on saying how great they were!! yogi thanks for making me look so good :) This really should be more than 5 stars.
226863,35889,2007-11-21,5,"I followed the recipe exactly, as I usually don't have good luck with yeast rolls.  These turned out wonderfully.  I made them ahead of time at Thanksgiving and had frozen yeast rolls in reserve.  These will definitely be served instead of the frozen!  Very easy to make and very good!  Thanks!"
520150,35889,2007-12-13,5,"Wonderful!  I loved how quickly they rose!  Very soft bread. I made breadsticks out of mine.  Dipped them in melted butter, then in a parmesan/garlic mixture.  Let them rise a bit & baked.  Yummy!  I'm suppose to take them to a friends house tomorrow night, but I don't know if they will make it!  Made about 30 breadsticks.  Thank you very much for this lovely recipe that I will use again & again!"
91392,35889,2007-12-25,5,"No one needs another review for these, but I can't believe how fast and easy these really were. I used the dough to make a long rectangle, spread with butter, cinnamon, raisins and sugar, rolled it up, cut into 12 pieces, pushed pieces into a buttered pan, touching, baked for I think only 15 minutes, cooled, put on powdered sugar glaze. Super easy cinnamon rolls! I'll never do it the hard way again! Going to try this with peacn rolls next. No limit for what you can do with the basic dough!"
203111,35889,2008-01-20,5,"These are wonderful!  Nice and light, fluffy and delicious! I used the dough cycle on my bread machine for these and made 16 very good-sized buns."
394077,35889,2008-07-31,5,"The dough of this recipe is great to work with. I did, however, let it rised twice. The buns came out soft and very tasty. I made 6 hamburger buns and 7 hot dog buns. Another keeper. Thank you for sharing the recipe."
140132,35889,2013-09-16,0,Tasty is right.  I made this recipe for my family and we loved them.  The leftover buns my kids heated up the next morning and topped with jelly.  So good.  I will continue to make this recipe.  Delicious.
49304,35889,2014-11-21,5,"OH My, Oh My, these buns are so delicious, so easy, I let the dough rise twice, then made the buns. So fast, So light and tasty. They remind me of rolls my mom use to make. I have made them twice. The first time I made them I added some cardamom, candied fruit and dried cramberries to part of the dough, delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you so much for sharing.&lt;br/&gt;Update: I have made these SOOOOOooo many times everyone loves them. I am always asked to make these buns for dinners. Recently I made them for a dinner &amp; our new Granddaughter-in-law was surprised that these were homemade. She said, you made these from scratch. I gave her the recipe.I am making them for Thanksgiving dinner at our DS&amp; DDIL&#039;s.  Update Nov 2014 I will be making these again this year as I have for 8 years. So good &amp; easy. I am always asked to bring the Tasty Buns &amp; My Pumpkin Pie."
362983,35889,2016-10-12,5,"This is a new favourite for me! I used this recipe to make smaller dinner rolls. (Leftovers made for great tiny sandwiches!) The first time I used all vegetable oil and the rolls were nice and soft but lacking that nice buttery flavour. The second time I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup butter (melted) and that woke the rolls right up. I much prefer it with some butter in the dough. Next time I may try subbing all the oil for butter, but I really liked it with half butter, half oil! I also like this method of mixing half the flour first and then the rest as it needs it. This made it a lot easier for me to mix than just throwing all the flour in all at once. I let the dough have a full first rise (it took only maybe 40 minutes because my ingredients were warmer than lukewarm; so my dough rose quickly!) and I ended up making 32 rolls! So many rolls! They turned out so soft and delicious, and perfect for our Thanksgiving dinner. It made me smile seeing people keep reaching for them! And they're still soft and delicious the next day. Thank you!"
632249,80413,2008-10-19,5,Just wonderful! An easy recipe that I will be using alot. Thx Marie.
103876,80413,2005-01-03,5,"Wow!  These turned out great.  I made 1/2 the recipe for 6 good size ""hotdog"" buns.  We had them with chicken italian sausage and sauerkraut.  I was a bit skeptical about the low amount of yeast, but they turned out perfect.  These buns are so much better than store bought.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I also posted a picture."
64203,80413,2005-01-06,5,"I was inspired by Chris from Kansas' picture to make these buns. I'm so glad that I did because they are the most wonderful hamburger buns I've ever made! The texture is light,fluffy, and tender. The taste is delicious and they are so incredibly easy to make! Mine had to bake for 15 minutes versus the 9 stated in the recipe, but they turned out perfect. Thanks for posting this recipe!"
13796,80413,2005-01-09,5,Ok.. I'll be #11 review...  these rolls are fantastic! I'll make them smaller next time. They are so fluffy and light and delicious. Oh wow... I used this to make my breaded cod sandwich. I've NEVER had better. ...  'nuff said. Marie.. Thank YOU!
59780,80413,2005-04-17,5,"Great recipe! I made it exactly as directed and it worked great. Thanks for posting, as summer approaches I paln to use this recipe alot :)"
173314,80413,2005-04-22,5,turned out wonderful! I brushed a little more butter on top of roll right before baking and probably left them to rise about 2 hours. I bake 13 minutes on my air bake and made 16 rolls using my 3 inch round cookie cutter...the size was perfect as they puffed up nicely once risen.  thanks so much for another great recipe Marie!
53932,80413,2005-08-27,4,"Though the rolls tasted good, I had difficulty working with the dough.  It was extremely sticky.  I baked them for about 18 minutes at 350."
88099,80413,2005-10-28,5,"Wow.  These are excellent buns.  Love the texture and very easy to make.  I made mine a little too large, but so what.  They were great.  Had Marg@Cayman Designs' Bull's Eye Burger recipe #122535 with this and it made for a great meal.  Thanks.  I'll work on my sizing next time."
137911,80413,2005-12-10,5,"Made this to serve with sloppy joes tonight.... to make the ordinary extraordinary. My 9 yo decided to have one on the side with butter too and said ""These are the bomb mom!""  Dh loved them too.  I liked that they did not have so much oil as other bun recipes I've seen.  I like the taste of the butter in them and the sweetness the sugar adds.  It was sooo much easier to make than I imagined too with your technique."
278113,80413,2006-01-20,5,"Made these to go with our turkey burgers tonight. Not only were they easy to make, they were delicious!! These will be a regular in our home, and we will never buy them at the store again...thanks for a great recipe!"
146047,80413,2006-02-20,5,"Marie, these buns were fantastic. Nice and light, and not too sweet like store-bought buns tend to be. I substituted in 1 c white whole wheat flour and 1/4 c soy flour for part of the bread flour, and added in 2 T gluten to make up for it. Shaped them into 9 large buns by hand for turkey burgers last night, and loved every bite. In fact, I ate a plain bun as a snack later that night! No butter needed-- they're that good. Cheers."
121185,80413,2006-02-20,3,"I am sooo sorry!  I am an avid bread maker and this was my 1st time using a breadmaker for the dough cycle - everything was going great (rose beautifully, looked lovely) until the very end - they came out sort of flat & crunchy!  Like french bread crunchy....not  what we were looking for in a hamburger bun...."
394077,80413,2007-01-24,5,Very good bread.  Turned out beautifully.  I used 1 egg white and 1 Tablespoon of cold water as a wash and the buns came out nice golden brown and shiny.  Thank you for the recipe.
40961,80413,2007-07-30,5,"I made these today and everyone loved them. They are so easy and so good I can't imagine buying store bought rolls again. I had a little extra dough so I rolled into dinner style rolls, put them in an 8x8 pan and brushed them with butter. They stayed in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 and they were delicious. The hamburger rolls took 11 minutes. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
18391,80413,2007-10-05,5,Great bread recipe! I used it to make large hotdog buns for paninis. Thanks for posting!
185285,80413,2007-10-15,5,"Great! I halved this recipe and got 5 large buns. My bread machine dough cycle includes time to rise, and I was uncertain if I should let the dough rise once before shaping the rolls, so I actually took the dough out before the cycle finished, shaped my buns and let them rise that way. My rise time was closer to 2 hours as a result.  Next time, I'll try the double-rise technique. These have a very non-yeasty, slightly sweet taste to them.  Like a better version of store bought buns. I subbed 1/3 of the flour with AP so they would be as soft as possible and it worked very well.  Before baking, I brushed with a mixture of 1 beaten egg w/ a tsp of water for a golden, shiny top!"
54678,80413,2008-01-30,5,DH whipped up a couple batches for a gathering and took quite the ribbing from the guys but hey the bread machine does most of the work. This was our first hamburger bun recipe that we've tried and would say it was quite successful.
47907,80413,2008-03-27,5,"I made these the other day to go along with Recipe #127868 and they came out WONDERFUL!!!!  It was so easy to toss in the bread machine and let it do it's thing.  I took the dough out, divided in half, and using a 3 5/8 inch biscuit cutter, cut them in rounds.  I got 9 large buns but could have gotten at least 14 or so if I had rerolled my scraps out.  I proofed them in my oven and it took a little longer to rise than stated in the recipe but not much.  I baked for about 14 minutes in my convection oven. The buns were so good and LOOKED like burger buns!  This will be my go-to recipe when I need buns for burgers, sloppy joes, barbecue, etc.  Thank you for posting a recipe that I will be using from now on!!!!!"
248023,80413,2008-08-05,5,"I don't know what I can possibly say about these delicious hamburger buns that haven't already been said...  They were easy as pie to throw in the ABM... I was kind of scared since I could NEVER get my breads to rise the 2nd time, but was pleasantly surprised when I saw they rose beautifully.  I did not roll out the dough, but instead portioned the dough into 12 balls, then gently tucked the edges under and slightly rolled them on the board to give them a nice smooth top.  I let them rise in my oven ( which I had pre-heated to 100F just briefly).  They smelled so good while baking and came out golden brown delicious!  We had to sample some and found they tasted just like the yummy yeasty rolls at O'Charley's!  YUM!  These were wonderful as grilled chicken sandwiches...  Tender, soft, with a nice light crust... Never will I buy buns at the store again...  I am forever spoiled!!!  Next challenge will be to try hot dog buns!!!"
160974,80413,2008-10-31,5,"I've made these twice with GREAT results. The first time my kitchen was humid and my dough was super sticky. I kept adding flour to make it manageable. My rolls DID turn out delightful, though. The second time my kitchen was much cooler and my flour amount was fine. Both times I did not roll the dough, but shaped into balls, flattening the tops a bit.  These rolls were so light but with a nice sturdy texture (like the ones in the photos). Thanks Marie!
Roxygirl"
222433,80413,2009-01-11,5,Very good and very easy (even for me a novice bread maker)!! I have used them for sloppy joes and Kittencals crock pot pulled pork. Keeper!! Thanks Marie!
59163,80413,2009-05-26,5,"OMG! My new favorite recipe.  I loved this, it was so easy and the buns turned out perfectly. I cut them out in 3 1/2"" I like the fact that you can make any size bun you want, smaller for women and larger for the guys!  Next time I will try the addition of whole wheat flour and maybe some other additions like onion flakes as suggested by MarySC.  I served these to guests with tuna patties 28025, everyone raved about them."
29014,80413,2009-07-16,5,"As my husband said ""don't do anything different""!  All I did do differently is to use plain old AP flour because that's what I had on hand.  This recipe is a life-saver.  We were so sick and tired of the store-bought buns.  First of all, they aren't even any good around here, and second ~ too many in a package for just the two of us.  These buns freeze well (unlike store-bought) so we can just fill up a big freezer bag and take out what we need.  Next time, I am going to make half hamburger shaped and half for hot dogs or sausages.  These are SO good.  Thank you so much for posting, Marie!!"
126440,80413,2009-11-08,5,Great buns.  I made this using 3/4 c. whole wheat but as written otherwise.  I only got 10 buns using 3 1/2 inch rounds.  Great flavor and easy to do. I did have to cook mine longer (14 min.)
879716,80413,2009-11-22,5,"I just finished my first batch of these buns and they are great.  I used a champagne flute to cut small buns to use for sliders and they came out the perfect size.  Unfortunately I did a couple things wrong as I am new to breadmaking.  First, I overworked my dough a bit as I tried to get as many buns out of it as I could... I shouldn't have mashed the leftover bits together because those buns didn't rise very well.  Secondly, I forgot to brush with butter only to remember it when I noticed there was no browning.  I brushed with butter and baked a little longer only to have the bottoms burn.  I know better now!  I cut the bottoms off and will just use two tops per burger.  I'll definitely use this recipe again and try not to burn anything!  Thanks for sharing Marie :)"
203111,80413,2011-05-21,5,"Delicious, light and fluffy buns.  I do take issue with the instructions to roll the dough to 1"" thickness, though.  I did this (yes I actually got out my ruler) and could only find a 3"" glass to cut them out with so I thought I would get more than a dozen buns.  I only got 101/2 buns...very tall buns.  Some were 3"" tall.  Next time I make these (and there will be many next times) I'll do my best to find a 31/2"" cutter and I'll roll the dough to less than an inch.  All in all, a wonderful recipe, though.  Thanks Marie!"
937635,80413,2011-07-24,5,"Wow! Awesome! These are so good - I will (barring moments of great laziness) Never buy store bought buns again! I made these to sandwich Paula Deen's Crab Cakes from the Food Network website. Delish! Thanks :)<br/><br/>ETA: I've made these a million times now and they're wonderful! Today I was halfway thru making them & realized I was out of eggs, so I added an extra 1/2 tsp yeast, 2 tbs of butter & a tbs of canola oil. They turned out great!"
362983,80413,2013-04-03,5,"This has been my go-to hamburger bun recipe! So easy to put together, and the buns come out beautifully: soft on the inside, yet nice and sturdy. I used AP flour mixed with wheat gluten to substitute the bread flour. (#416294 is a great substitute) I use a little less sugar than called for, and I don&#039;t use a cutter; I just divide the dough by hand and usually out with around 12-14 good sized buns. Mine usually take around 15-18 minutes at 350. It&#039;s good to keep an eye on them. Wonderful recipe; thanks so much!"
8629,80413,2013-05-26,3,Good tasting but I wish that they would have raised more.  I let them raise for 2 hours but they still did not raise as much as I would have liked.
140132,80413,2013-08-27,5,I made these to go with some turkey burgers I made and they were perfect.  They were moist and lite which complimented the burgers beautifully.  thank you for sharing with us.  We loved them.
894666,80413,2016-03-18,5,"These were very nice! I normally use bread machine yeast in my maker but my husband had fortunately (I guess) bought active-dry this last time and I wasn&#039;t sure how these would turn out since I thought you were supposed to proof active-dry? Anyway I just dumped it all in no proofing and these turned out excellent. I got 12 slider sized buns out of this with a bit of dough leftover so I just made 3 bonus rolls. The last few mins of baking I rubbed butter on the tops and sprinkled sesame seeds over, that was when they turned golden on top! Sliced each one and these took our st. paddy&#039;s day guinness burgers http://www.food.com/recipe/guinness-burgers-22210 over the top! Thanks!!"
400708,80413,2018-12-12,5,"OMG, these turned out sooooo good and so much better than store bought, I'll never buy them again. Using the bread machine made it easy and the results - Wow!! I did brush mine before baking with an egg white and top with toasted sesame seeds, the inside of these came out pillowy soft, but still firm enough to stand up to all our hamburger fixings. As I said, NEVER buy store bought again"
101034,95222,2004-09-16,5,We really enjoyed these tasty chops. I followed your recipe exactly as written and were so pleased with the finished product. This will be a keeper for sure. Thanks for posting.
121185,95222,2004-10-04,3,These were ok.  The sauce was thin and tasted ok. But the bake time was too long - mine were WAY done when checked at 40 min (and we had some fairly thick chops.
92886,95222,2004-10-07,4,"like some other reveiwers, I skipped the oven part and just finished the chops off by simmering them in the skillet with the sauce.  I liked the sauce, but would leave out the ketchup next time."
126104,95222,2004-10-16,4,"These were very good.  I used garlic powder and salt rather than garlic salt, and got a little heavy on the salt, but they were still good.  I think the cooking time was a little excessive (and that's the only reason I didn't give it a 5) because mine was very dry.   The next time I'll put the top on and take it out sooner.  Who knows:  I may even try some fresh garlic!!"
29014,95222,2004-10-27,5,"Very tasty chops!  I used 1"" thick meat and only had to bake for 1/2 hour (pork is too lean now to bake longer without drying out).  I also doubled the sauce as that is what DH prefers.  Served with steamed chopped broccoli and seasoned rice - poured the extra sauce over the rice, too.  Thanks, Brad!"
173314,95222,2004-11-19,4,Very tasty marinade...I would even use on chicken.  I reduced cooking time to 30 minutes.. Great with fried rice or lo mein!  Thanks for an easy and quick recipe
146047,95222,2004-12-27,5,"Great pork. I prepared this to use in Sue L's Chinese Fried Rice #38748, and it was perfect. I used half honey, half maple syrup, miso broth, fresh garlic, and crystallized ginger. Per previous reviewers, I simmered this on the stovetop for about a half hour. Great combination of salty and sweet. Thanks for posting!"
177933,95222,2005-01-02,5,"This was wonderful!  I also simmered the pork on the stove and added a little crushed red pepper to give it a little spice.  I let the sauce simmer even after the pork was done until it thickened- delicious!However, next time I will turn it into a stir-fry and dice the pork (or chicken)add steamed brocoli, water chestnuts, green onions and whatever else sounds good and eat it over rice.  Thank you so much, my husband and I both loved it!"
182624,95222,2005-01-07,5,I baked exactly as directed...easy and delicious!
160974,95222,2005-01-13,5,"We really enjoyed this easy pork chop recipe. I used fresh ginger  and did not change anything. I would encourage people not to skip the browning step. You really need a good searing to develop flavor in this dish. I sliced thinly and coated with the sauce. Very kid-friendly, too.
Roxygirl in Colo."
184723,95222,2005-01-18,4,"The sauce was ecellent, we only left it in the oven for 35 mins and they came out a little overdone? Maybe I browned them too long?  I only had them 2 mins on each side... I might have better luck next time.  Thanks!"
180090,95222,2005-01-23,4,"These were very good, although the flavor of the sauce wasn't very strong, maybe I should baste them next time? Be careful not to over cook them! Thanks for the quick easy recipe! "
176615,95222,2005-01-26,5,"Yum-yum! I used very thick pork chops, at least an inch, and cooked the full hour, basting a few times with the sauce. They were well done, almost too done, so I'd suggest watching that these puppies don't dry out on you in the oven. The sauce was quite nice, gave the pork which I often find to be bland and dry, a good bit of flavor. The kids also liked this very much. Thanks, Brad!"
47559,95222,2005-02-02,3,"I guess I'm the odd ball on this recipe.  I made them as written.  I thought the pork chops were overcooked, dry and tough.  The sauce was good but hadn't penetrated the pork chops at all.  With all the good reviews, we were very disappointed."
173579,95222,2005-03-02,4,"These were very tasty.  Bake time was too long, but will make again.  Thanks for posting."
92816,95222,2005-03-07,5,"This a delicious recipe for pork chops.I made a single serving of this so I only used about 2 tbsp of honey,soy sauce & ketchup.I did not have any chicken broth but it was great without it.I also used minced garlic instead of garlic salt.Excellent!"
187281,95222,2005-03-10,2,"I am quite surprised by all  the good reviews for this recipe.  It was terrible.  My family wouldn't eat it. You have to love ketchup and salt to appreceiate this one.

Sorry! :-("
28649,95222,2005-03-11,3,The sauce for these chops were good but baking for an hour in the oven is way too long.  The chops were dried out.  I may try again but with a much shorter baking time.
8688,95222,2005-03-13,5,"My husband says, ""Be sure to save this recipe!"" So, I won't allow this one to go far ; )  I tripled the sauce because I am married to Mr Condiments.  He likes everything with sauce to have more than enough.  This sauce is delicious!  I used six 3/4"" pork loin chops and the hour given was just right. Thanks for sharing this with us, Brad!"
119466,95222,2005-04-24,4,"These were very good. I skipped the ketchup & just left them in the skillet when transferring to the oven. My pork chops were very thick, but were still done in less than an hour. Thanks for the recipe!"
93006,95222,2005-05-11,4,"A nice change of flavor for pork chops, and easy to throw together quickly."
189616,95222,2005-05-15,3,"We didn't really care for the sauce, the chops were tender, used thick ones. Did exactly as recipe noted, found the syrup very thin which wasn't really the problem, we just found it too soy saucey, overpowering."
207176,95222,2005-06-07,5,My family all liked it!  I doubled all ingredients except for the ketchup and honey.  I prepared it according to the directions and it was very easy. I only baked the chops for 40 minutes and that was perfect. Thanks!
142464,95222,2005-10-24,5,"Tried this recipe for supper last evening and between bites, all I could hear hubby say was ""Boy, are these chops ever good!!"" and I definitely agreed with him.  I too used garlic instead of garlic salt and I tripled the sauce.  Chicken would also taste yummy with this sauce.  Definitely a keeper in my books.  Thanks Brad for posting."
229850,95222,2006-04-24,5,"I thought I would send you on your way to 200 reviews ha! Loved it. Made sauce x4 after reading through reviews. Made wide egg noodles, thickened sauce with cornstarch and poured over the noodles. Yum Yum. Thanx for a great recipe that my family really enjoyed, and I soo enjoyed the ease of it all."
55729,95222,2006-05-20,3,"I'm sorry - this just didn't turn out for me. The chops turned out completely fry and tough. The cooking time should definitely be less, but I was not wowed enough by the sauce to try again."
188119,95222,2006-07-31,5,"This came out pretty good.  I used beef broth instead and let it simmer in the sauce in the pan.  In the end though, most of the liquid evaporated and it became a nice glaze that was not too sweet and pretty good.  Thanks!"
37779,95222,2006-08-06,3,I had a little problem with this recipe. The sauce burned slightly with the one hour cooking time. I think that could easily be remedied by doubling the sauce. Not all was lost because the chops didn't burn and they were flavorful. Thanks for posting.
59473,95222,2006-08-24,4,"The sauce was very tasty for these pork chops, but I felt it was too thin. I also thought they were not as tender as I would have liked. I think the next time I will do them for the whole time in the frying pan."
255338,95222,2006-08-28,5,"My children , all 4 of them, loved this dish, and that is a rarity in this home. I added a little bit more honey and soy sauce and cooked it in a skillet for 35 minutes. Thank you for posting."
140132,95222,2006-09-18,5,"well... like all the other reviewers we loved this recipe.  My picky 16 yr old son walked in the door and said, ""man supper smells amazing"".   Needless to say this is now one of our regular chop recipes.  thank you for a great dinner idea.
"
13796,95222,2006-10-19,2,"After all the reviews, I guess I was expecting something delicious. Wow.. was I NOT impressed with this recipe. At least I can use the meat for fried rice. I made according to the recipe except I did 6 chops and tripled the sauce. I think this is a waste of time and ingredients. "
250031,95222,2006-10-20,3,"I have to first say that I used chicken, not pork chops (the store's chops just didn't look good today). My children liked it well enough and it was easy. I'll make it again. It wasn't a big WOW but it was a satisfactory and easy to prepare meal -- but keep in mind that I did modify the main ingredient!"
362983,95222,2006-11-01,5,"I think this is the first time I've ever had pork chops that were THIS tender! Whenever my family has pork chops, they end up being in the oven too long and drying out too much. I browned the chops first with some oil (I added lots of black pepper to the meat too) and then removed the meat and made the sauce (I doubled the amount, used brown sugar since I didn't have any honey, garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and nixed the ginger) I poured that in the same pan, heated the sauce up and added cornstarch/water to thicken it slightly. Then I poured it over the chops, put it all in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes, and basted the chops with the sauce twice in that time. They came out SO tender!! I'd say don't skimp on using the oven. It's definitely worth it, just as long as you don't bake them too long. Even my family was impressed with how tender they were! And that sauce is to die for! I'm definitely making these again (and again and again!)"
394077,95222,2006-12-08,4,Very easy and tasty.  I had to double the sauce mixture though.
377581,95222,2006-12-10,4,"Like some other reveiwers, I skipped the oven part and just finished the chops off by simmering them in the skillet with the sauce for about half an hour, turning them every five minutes. The meat was a little dry and the sauce was very thin, but the flavour was great."
103876,95222,2007-01-01,4,I made this exactly as written and the flavor was good.  I thought the sauce was a bit too salty (even though I used lower sodium soy sauce).  This dish has a traditional oriental flair.
136997,95222,2007-01-22,4,"This was delicious. I used 1"" chops and believe next time I will cut the cooking time back to 40 min. My husband really enjoyed the sauce. :)"
50969,95222,2007-01-24,5,"The first time I rated this was Feb.20th 2005, and I just wanted to come back to re-rate this recipe.I still give this 5*'s I was a little short on time so I used a pound of boneless pork loin that I had cubed into bite-sized pieces,browned in a little canola oil.Mixed together all the sauce ingredients and added to the pork that was simmering in the skillet. I covered it and let the pork  simmer for about 30 minutes and it turned out I think even better than the first time I made it. Thanks again for such a great recipe."
262312,95222,2007-02-05,5,"Who would've thought such few, simple ingredients would result in such wonderful flavor !  I'm really impressed.  This was so easy and flavorful!  I topped the dish with green onions, used 4 garlic cloves, shallots, and serrano peppers cuz we like it hot! I took the advice of others and diced the pork and just simmered in the skillet without baking.  Served over white rice.  DH said if I added chopped peanuts it would have been over the top!  Maybe I'll try that next time!  Thanks for the keeper Brad!"
91392,95222,2007-02-11,4,"Very easy, very quick when you do it on the stovetop, great taste for very cheap ingredients.  Will try the sauce with other types of meat, but cutting the boneless porkchops into strips, stir frying them, then cooking in the sauce for about 30 minutes was good for us."
46660,95222,2007-02-13,5,"Not like this really needs another review, but I'm going to add mine anyway :)

I did these on the stove like so many other people suggested.  I used stir fry oil to brown the chops and homemade turkey stock instead of the chicken broth. I simmered them for about 30 minutes, flipping every 5.  Then I reomoved them from the skillet and tented them in foil for 5 minutes.

I'm not usually a huge fan of pork chops, but these were really tasty!  The sauce was nice and thick, the chops were tender, my kids loved them.  I served them with lemon rice and roasted asparagus.  A great and simple meal that I will make again!  Thanks!"
133174,95222,2007-02-18,5,"What can I add that hasn't already been said?  I browned this in a cast iron pan, poured the sauce over and placed in the oven.  The chops I used were easily 3/4 inch thick and required the full cooking time.  Served this along with recipe #195903 for a wonderful meal."
329638,95222,2007-04-19,5,"Very tasty- DH loved these.  I browned them on my grill pan, then popped them into the oven in the pan.  Very tasty! Thanks!"
252816,95222,2007-04-20,5,This recipe is now my favorite way of cooking pork chops..I used 2 boneless chops and the sauce really cooked down. If I were to make more than 2 chops I would double the sauce recipe..SOooooGood..Diffinitely  a Keeper....Made it with twice baked potatoes and roasted green beans and apple pie bars for dessert..Thank You for this Great recipe....
125640,95222,2007-05-16,4,"I've tried these both in the oven (cooked for the full hour, but at only 325F) and simmered on the stove top. It's good both ways. I think maybe I liked it a little better on the stovetop though. The only change I make is to add a clove of minced garlic to the sauce. Tender and tasty. Thanks."
89831,95222,2007-06-09,3,"This is good and very similar to my recipe#134655 but I think I prefer my recipe to this one, it just did not have enough ""oomph"" to it, but thank you for sharing anyway...Kitten"
222055,95222,2007-06-10,5,"After reading all the fabulous reviews, I too cooked mine on the stove top. Just too hot outside to heat up the oven for that long. I did burn mine on the outside alittle (my negligence), but they were still very good and tender and great the next day. I would definetly try them again! Thank You Brad!!!"
286851,95222,2007-06-28,3,"My family liked the taste of these pork chops, but I did have to alter how it was made. I followed the ingredient list exactly, however, I noted two things while I was making it. After browning the chops on both sides as directed, the chops did not need an entire hour more to cook. I feel they would have been dried out. In fact, after less than 30 minutes the chops were cooked through. I too found the sauce very thin and watery-like and the sauce did not appear to thicken up at all in the oven. I ended up taking it out of the oven and cooking it on the stove top at a high heat to reduce the sauce. Once I did this, we did enjoy the taste. I will remake it, but next time, I will do it all on the stovetop."
377039,95222,2007-08-09,5,"I can't believe I've not rated these before.  These are the most delicious, tender, juicy, incredible chops I or anyone I've served them to have EVER tasted.

Tips I've found: The sauce is the incredible thing here; make the chops however you want then pour it over them. Water can be substituted for broth in a pinch.  Garlic rather than garlic salt is just as good.  The sauce can be doubled (or quadrupled, or more) and frozen in batches.  The sauce is best when thickened with a bit of cornstarch.  It's delicious on chicken, too.  This sauce is ALWAYS in my freezer now, for a quick answer to a delicious dinner any night of the week! We love this!"
158086,95222,2007-08-16,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe...I too cooked it on top of the stove as other reviews, and uncovered it after 15 minutes to let sauce thicken up...served with rice....easy eye appealing recipe."
218535,95222,2007-08-16,1,"After reading all the reviews,, I was so excited to try this. But my family really didn't like this at all. The sauce is too sweet (probably because of the honey)."
227607,95222,2007-09-17,5,These were great.  I think next time I will marinate the chops in some of the sauce then baste some more on while cooking.  Everyone loved it and I will make again.
33159,95222,2007-09-20,5,"We enjoyed this recipe very much!  Succulent flavour!!  I did, however, modify the method, due to time constraints.  I doubled the sauce mixture & marinated my boneless pork chops in it overnight & then popped them on the grill until cooked through.  The meat was still very tender!"
231054,95222,2007-10-01,5,"I have to add my stars to the hundreds you have already received!  We really enjoyed these pork chops -- I used some bonless ones.  Your dierctions were percise and easy to follow.  After the chops were done baking, I transferred all those wonderful juices to a small saucepan and added a little cornstarch mixture to thicken it a bit.  Then served it over the chops and the rice I served along side.  It was delicious.  For any of you who are planning on trying this recipe -- don't waste that wonderful liquid these chops bake in.  Thanks Brad for sharing -- I can see why it's your favorite pork chop recipe."
579298,95222,2007-10-16,3,"The first time I tried this recipe I would have given it 1 star. I used thin chops (boneless), marinated them over night - and then simmered them instead of baking (all these ideas from ratings). Needless to say, we couldn't even finish them. I did, however, want to try them one more time. So I purchased the BIG chops (close to the 1 inch mark) bone in. I also dusted them with a little white pepper and wheat flour - and then I followed the directions as stated and baked them for 1 hour turning and basting once. MUCH MUCH better prepared as directed. DH and I enjoyed the recipe and may eat it again but it is still not on our favorites list."
632249,95222,2007-11-13,3,Nice way to change up the usual pork chop dinner.  So simple. Did reduce baking time as suggested in other reviews. Thx.
499050,95222,2007-11-27,4,Very Good
497077,95222,2007-12-26,5,"These chops are GREAT! I made these on the stove top. I doubled ingredients for lots of sauce, added chinese chili garlic sauce for some spiciness, and added cornstarch to thicken sauce at end. Will be making often!!! Thank you."
666723,95222,2008-01-22,5,"I'm so glad I found this recipe!  DH loves fried pork chops but I think they can be bland so this is perfect for us.  We both gave it 5 stars!  I poked my chops with a fork a bunch of times then marinated them in a big bag for 6 hours.  I added some red pepper flakes for heat, and used fresh giner and fresh garlic.  I didn't have honey so I used light corn syrup and brown sugar.  I read reviews, and have to say that the ketchup was great in there... not overpowering at all.  I did mine in a large skillet, up high with none of the marinade first so they would be browned, then poured the marinade in and it took about 35 minutes to reduce.  I will make these again and again and can't wait to try some variations.. maybe add pineapple?  I served the chops with garlic rice and (Ginger Broccoli #82896)... YUUMMMMM!"
265954,95222,2008-02-09,4,"This results in a very tasty sauce.  I used 4 bone-in, thin cut pork chops, which I would NOT recommend, but would recommend the thicker cuts, instead.  I doubled the sauce and, based on other reviewers' comments, simmered the chops and the sauce for 15 minutes, covered.  I then removed the chops, covered in foil, and continued simmering the sauce, adding 3/4 teaspoon corn starch to thicken.  I served with my white rice recipe, and with steamed-in-the bag veggies. Nice post!"
264017,95222,2008-04-26,5,"I'm proud to be the 347th reviewer for this fantastic recipe! I combined several ideas from previous reviewers to give this a 5+ star rating. First, I browned 4 bone-in chops under the broiler, then doubled the sauce using 4 cloves of freshly minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Then I cut slits in each chop to marinate for 4 hours. When ready to cook, I put all in a large frying pan on the stovetop and simmered for 45 minutes, turning the chops every 10 minutes. The sauce turned to a rich, thick glaze and the meat was tender and moist. Thanks Brad!"
9869,95222,2008-05-15,5,Great flavours and nice tender pork chops. I served with creamy mashed potatoes and stir fry vegetables. Delicious meal.
485151,95222,2008-12-19,4,"I thought this was ok just to eat as regular pork chops. No one in the family raved about it, but everyone ate it. I would like to try and take the pork chops from this recipe and slice them up to use in a stir-fry. I think that would be great!"
13483,95222,2009-04-13,5,This was a great little dish.  I did do it in the oven but think I will just do it in a fry pan next time.  The sauce is good and I agree it would be worth doubling it.  Thanks for the post Brad.
808027,95222,2009-04-22,5,"Followed others' advice from the reviews and did mine on the stovetop and also added 2 large minced cloves of garlic.  This would also make a wonderful stir fry sauce if you used chopped pork tenderloin, onions, green peppers and carrots.  Will try that also.  This is an awesome recipe and will immediately go into our regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing...no surprise that it has gotten so many rave reviews."
324621,95222,2009-04-27,3,Our family didn't like these too well. Weren't very flavorful or tender. Still looking for that perfect pork chop recipe!!
532289,95222,2009-11-02,4,These were pretty good.l  I made as directed with Chef Steveo's cooking directions.  I asked DH and DS what they thought and they both said 4 stars so that's what they are rated.  I served them with Easy Garlic Rice by Bergy also on this site.  With a side of green beans we had a nice meal compliments of Zaar. Thanks for sharing.
174991,95222,2010-04-21,5,"I used low sodium chicken broth, soy sauce, ketchup and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Followed the recipe as stated.  Wonderful.  Served it over brown rice with lentils."
178742,95222,2010-11-09,0,"This is still one of our favorite dishes. I just made them a few minutes ago. Here is my latest. I did thme on the stove top. I oiled my cast iron skillet with canola, enough to cover. Seasoned my chops with my favorite seasoning, and browned chops each side about 4 minutes. In the meantime, I mixed my other ingredients for the sauce. Which I recommend highly that you double. If you don't there is no way there will be enough sauce and you will be disappointed. I too, like another reviewer used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I then removed chops from skillet and added more oil to cover the skillet. Put chops back in the skillet, reduced heat to medium, poured sauce over chops, covered skillet with lid, and cooked on medium for about 15-20 minutes (thin chops), turning and basting with the sauce in skillet about 3 times. Served with rice and broccoli. I love this recipe!! Thanks!"
131021,95222,2010-11-14,5,"My Dh really loved this in fact after the boneless pork chops were gone he saved the sauce to dip anything that he could find in it. I would have liked the sauce to be a bit thicker, in fact next time I might try to thicken it on the stove at the end. I also used garlic powder instead of salt and it worked out great. I also salted and peppered the chops as I was browning them. YUM."
126440,95222,2010-11-16,5,I doubled the sauce but most of it cooked away.  I would cook them less time as mine were a little dry.  Flavor is out of this world good.  Served with Recipe #256364.
389431,95222,2011-04-02,4,A great way to keep the pork tender and allow its natural flavor to shine through.  I doubled the sauce to allow for dipping.
55578,95222,2011-04-12,3,"Not sure what all the hub bub is about.  I doubled the sauce as other reviews recommended, did everything according to instructions, I even used home made chicken broth, but it didn't turn my crank.  DH said he liked it.  Was it because I doubled the sauce? It didn't seem to flavor the chops much.  Sorry for the review."
73469,95222,2011-08-29,2,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible! The best thing I can say about this dish is that my dog liked it! (Hence the two stars) I followed the directions exactly, and my meat turned out dry and the sauce was thin and hardly had any taste to it at all! Sorry, I really wanted to like it :("
97579,95222,2011-10-10,3,It was just okay.  I followed the directions and mine came out very dry..even with covering them with foil.  The kids weren't overly excited.
2041603,95222,2011-11-13,5,Yum-Yum indeed!
37036,95222,2011-12-13,0,"Really good chops!  I lreally liked them, but my hubby said they were just OK.  I browned them on both sides in a oven-proof skillet with lid.  Then placed the lid ontop and baked in the oven at 350F for about 40 minutes.  My chops had the bone and were about an inch thick. I also doubled the sauce.  I served this with white rice and green beans.  I'd make again."
844554,95222,2012-07-27,3,These were just ok for us. I cooked mine in the oven and covered with foil but they still turned out very dry and I only cooked them for 40 minutes. I used chili sauce instead of ketchup. The taste was good... just very dry chops.
482376,95222,2012-10-01,4,"The flavor is wonderful! I doubled the sauce and am glad I did. This would be great served over rice, I think. I used the oven method, but found that the pork chops were too dry after only about 35 minutes of cooking. I wish I would have checked them even earlier. This recipe is worth making again and experimenting on the timing. Thank you for posting. Made for Cookbook Tag game in the Cooking Tag Games forums."
1365025,95222,2012-10-29,4,"I followed this recipe to the tee except I only baked it for a half hour as the sauce was starting to burn and my meat was done. I think it needed to be covered until the last 15 minutes. I had one very large pork steak and it turned out very good, very tender, crispy but not too over done. Made this along side of veggies and hash browns."
1052873,95222,2012-12-09,2,"Tasty, but dried out. 2x the liquid, browned, covered, baked at 350 20 minutes for thin chops."
456858,95222,2012-12-30,4,"Oh man, I so wish I had taken the suggestions from some of the other posts: covering the pork chops.  I was rushed...it was getting late, so I wanted the chops to cook as soon as possible, still keeping the heat at 350.  The sauce/glaze was REALLY good, but the chops were dry as heck!  Way too dry 2 even eat, it was a good thing I made enough sweet potatoes as a side dish.  Might make again."
2549237,95222,2013-01-16,4,"Tasty pork chops.  Everyone loved these.  I decreased the bake time to 35 minutes as an hour would have been too long.  I also made another double batch of the ""sauce"" and poured them over fresh mushrooms and baked alongside the pork chops.  The mushrooms were even more delicious than the pork, highly recommend trying.  Thanks Brad!"
191533,95222,2013-03-23,3,"Good not great. I covered and baked for 45 minutes, still were a little dry. And I would prefer a sauce that is thicker than water."
400708,95222,2013-09-28,5,"I love this recipe, though I did make a few minor changes.  I used 2 thick chops, fresh ginger, and fresh garlic instead of salt.  Arghhh, just now realized I forgot the honey which I&#039;m sure would have made it even better; followed another reviewer and made it all on the stove top simmering in a covered pan.  Doubled the sauce and at the end added some flour to make a gravy and served with steamed rice and a salad.  So good - loved the flavors and really mad at myself for forgetting the honey which would have made it even better.  So easy to put together and full of flavor."
242484,95222,2013-10-30,5,"Oh my, these were wonderful!  I thought the sauce would taste like any teriyaki sauce but it was so much more...kind of sweet and savory at the same time.  Seriously, you will lick your plate clean!  Definitely make extra sauce so you can put it on rice."
486718,95222,2014-01-12,4,These were good but a little tough so I will decrease the cooking time next time. Thanks!
620763,95222,2015-03-09,4,Great sauce recipe! I slow cooked my pork and served with white rice and broccoli.
142367,95222,2015-04-02,5,Thank you for sharing this fantastic and easy recipe!  I have used it on chicken also with good results
128473,95222,2016-04-21,4,"Thank you for sharing your recipe.  We enjoyed the pork chops prepared this way.  Quick and easy to make entree, the pork chops were perfectly cooked and the sauce was thin but very tasty.  What a lovely meal, served with aspargus and jasmine rice. Made for What&#039;s on the Menu Tag Game."
1581225,95222,2016-12-02,5,"I was a bit worried about this one due to mixed reviews, but my family actually really enjoyed it, including me, the non pork eater. I paid attention to some of the tips. I cooked 6 chops, so I actually quadrupled the sauce. I used a 9x13 dish. The chops were swimming in the sauce. I probably could have done with doubling or maybe tripling, and I did cover them for 3/4 of the cooking time. I think the covering and extra sauce helped them stay juicy and not dry out. I also noticed the thicker chops (mine varied in thickness a bit) were more tender and fall apart. I would suggest nice thick chops. I will make this again."
60989,28148,2003-09-21,5,"I can't describe how good these were. And so easy! I used a light brushing of olive oil instead of the butter, and it was great! We loved them... thanks!!! "
52543,28148,2003-10-24,5,"I've never had chimichangas before so I can't compare to deep fried - but these were VERY GOOD!! To reduce the colesterol even further, I used low fat Cheddar & served with low fat sour cream on the side. Thanx Miss Annie!"
42720,28148,2004-06-16,5,"Oh Miss Annie, these were soooooo good!   The cumin and oregano really flavored the chicken and I loved your idea to add cheese to the filling mixture.  The outside was crispy and the inside was moist and juicy.  MMMMMMM!! We used sour cream and additional picante sauce as toppings.  MMMMM!!  We will be making these very often.  Thank you for posting!
"
126440,28148,2004-06-20,5,Very good recipe.  We had this a couple days ago and had some left over.  It is very filling.  I mixed green chili sauce and cream of mushroom soup (had it left over from Taco Ritos)  this goes together very quickly and has great flavor.
89831,28148,2004-07-16,5,"Miss Annie these were just to die for! I made mine with salsa, and added just a little fresh chopped garlic in with the chicken mixture, and brushed them with melted butter instead of margarine, I don't use margarine in my house. they were just so yummy. I baked them in the morning, as it is very hot in the afternoon, so I have already gobbled down one, and am trying very hard not to eat another one LOL! I doubled the recipe for these, as DS and fiance will be over tonight, these will be gone in a flash...excellent recipe Miss Annie!, I will make these again and again! thanks so much for posting...Kittencal:)"
37036,28148,2004-08-15,5,My family really ejoyed these and I liked the fact that they aren't fried!  I used Canarygirl's Chicken Verde recipe for the chicken and followed your directions exactly.  It was delicious.  I topped them with sour cream and a little extra salsa along with Spanish rice.  I think guacamole and queso would be great as well.  Thanks Miss Annie!
124190,28148,2004-09-05,4,"These were really good. I loved the technique. I did think that there needed to be more spice to the chicken mixture. I used mild salsa and the spice amounts as listed. next time I will use more cumin, as I love that flavor, and some garlic powder, pepper, and chili powder, I think. All in all, a great recipe, and one we will make again, definitely! Thanks!"
133174,28148,2004-12-11,5,"These are excellent!  I haven't made chimichangas in a long time because to be good they need to be nice and crisp.  I did not use the butter.  Instead I used my olive mister and lightly sprayed the filled tortillas.  Also, used turkey for the chicken.  They came out crisp and delicious.  "
7108,28148,2005-02-22,5,"My family loved these!  I omitted the onion, family preference.  Upon serving, I topped with shredded cheese and diced tomatoes; served with extra salsa and sour cream on the side.  I melted margarine spread and brushed that on prior to baking; they turned out very light and crispy...just perfect!"
142367,28148,2005-05-02,4,These are pretty good and much easier than stovetop.  I found them a bit dry and will add more salsa next time and maybe even some refried beans.  Thanks for the recipe!
136997,28148,2005-08-31,5,Thumbs up from my husband.:)I used a store bought roasted chicken. I also used extra chunky/mild salsa as I can't handle spicy foods very well. The recipe made 8 pieces for me.
35526,28148,2005-12-05,5,"These were very good.  I added some cilantro and a chopped hot pepper to mine.
Served with guacamole and sour cream.  Came out of the oven crisp and delicious.  We shall see how they reheat for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks Miss Annie for another great recipe!"
47907,28148,2006-01-02,5,How did I miss this recipe for so long?  These chimis were soooo good and so easy to make.  I'm thrilled that there is no frying involved!!  I made as posted except I ended up with 8 good sized chimis ~ more for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks so much for posting a keeper!
103876,28148,2006-01-04,5,"Wow!  These were great.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised at how good these turned out for the low amount of effort involved.  I used left-over rotisserie chicken, low-carb tortillas and reduced fat cheese and they turned out nice and crispy.  I will definitely be making these again."
187281,28148,2006-01-08,5,"Excellent recipe! The filling tasted like Tex-Mex   which made my family happy.  I would recommend adding garlic salt and some pepper   for a stronger flavor.  But, for a family with kids it is great.  The crispy pocket shape is appealing and the warm cheesy filling completes it perfectly.  I used Goya brand Salsa Pico de Gallo (mild homestyle chunky salsa) and mozzarella cheese for the filling.  I also think the idea of adding a squeeze or two of fresh lime juice and chopped cilantro would be great additions. But, the best part of this recipe is that if you have the items on hand to add, it's great... if not, it's still great. Highly recommended!"
60992,28148,2006-01-09,5,"Like this needs another 5 star review! But here again it gets it. What a fantastic recipe...it has flavor, color, ease of preperation and did I say flavor? I did add some garlic and chopped cilantro the filling. I was amazed at how crispy they came out...this is a treat ALL the way around."
91392,28148,2006-01-12,5,"Really fast to put together, and good.  I had to work with what I had here, using Middle Eastern flatbread, which pretty much is a tortilla, no Cheddar, so I subbed somehting with some taste, and I had to make my own salsa.  I boiled a whole chicken and had enough meat to double the recipe, and used a quarter cup measure, and came up with 15 chimichangas!  I hope they freeze well! I spritzed on some oil, top and bottom and they baked perfectly in about 30 minutes. I did spice up the insides with a bit of Tabasco, as my salsa was mild.  They were very juicy and nice.  I served them with guacamole and creme fraiche. Great recipe."
222433,28148,2006-01-16,5,"Very, very good recipe. The whole family ate these without anything on them...they are that good! Very easy. We will definitely be making these again! Thanks Miss Annie!"
184723,28148,2006-01-17,5,"I have made these with both chicken and beef.  Easy, quick and delicious!  I've decided to make them by the dozen now so I can freeze some and pop into my husband's lunch.  They reheat very well.  Thanks!"
53932,28148,2006-01-25,5,"Very, very good.  I made the recipe just as written but think I will follow the suggestions for adding additional spices next time.  It's easy to scale this down for one serving for a quick lunch.  Thanks for the recipe."
286851,28148,2006-03-03,5,"One of the best things I've made from the recipezaar site. Simple, easy to prepare and delicious. Can't wait to prepare them again. Great served with refried beans and mexican rice."
158086,28148,2006-03-28,5,These turned out perfect...I made the chicken meat in the crockpot so it would shred easily...turned out perfect...
176615,28148,2006-03-31,5,"Delicious! Quick to make and a great use for leftover chicken or even turkey. We added a little sour cream on top at serving. Yum! Thanks, Miss Annie, for a great recipe! UPDATE I've made these often since my first review. We had them tonight using whole wheat tortillas which was wonderful! I spritzed with canola oil and baked as directed. Would suggest lining the pan with foil for easy clean up. A simple dinner that goes together in no time. Thanks, Miss Annie!"
203111,28148,2006-04-25,5,"Ok, you don't really need another review, but I just gotta...These are SO GOOD, I just can't seem to get enough!  I've made them following recipe as is. Also have  substituted taco meat for the chicken, regular onion for the green, and have added sauteed green pepper.  Absolutely love these!  Thanks, Miss Annie.  "
27643,28148,2006-04-29,5,"Wonderful! I made these with no changes. They came out beautifully browned and with just the right amount of heat, I admit I did use mild salsa. :) We loved them! Thanks a bunch Miss Annie!"
312577,28148,2006-05-12,5,"Delicious.  I read all the reviews and incorporated the following 1.poached chicken in onion and garlic salt and montreal seasoning 2.Added sauteed green peppers and mushrooms 3.Added chili powder, tobasco and garlic. Best suggestion by a reviewer was to line your pan with aluminum foil - fantastic idea.  I GIVE THIS RECIPE TWO THUMBS UP!!! "
47559,28148,2006-05-24,5,"Add another 5 stars for this simple and tasty recipe.  I followed the recipe and added additional shredded cheese on top before baking.  They still came out crispy, but with gooey melted cheddar on top.  I garnished with sourcream and green onions.  Everyone came back for seconds.  I need to make more of them next time."
50969,28148,2006-05-31,4,"My SO and I thought that these were very good,weboth enjoyed the fact that they were oven
""fried"".as you can tell i added a little sour cream to the top along with a little extra cheese,and salsa.these will be made again.thank you for posting."
294000,28148,2006-06-01,3,"The flavor of the filling is excellent but didn't make very much.  I used whole wheat tortillas...maybe they were a little too large.  Also, the cooking time was too long.  I should have been watching closer but the tops were a little too done...they tasted dry.  I was disappointed as the reviews are so excellent.  I will probably try again and see if the problem was me (that's what I'm assuming given all these great reviews)."
58836,28148,2006-06-14,5,"Ok here is yet another 5* rating.  Made these and took to a church function and got rave reviews, especially from teens.  Had to make the tortillas, didn't have any on hand.  Took a little bit longer but was well worth it.  I filled the tortillas, rolled, then cut into bite size pieces.  One teen was so excited about them he said he loved me for bringing them.  Several asked for the recipe.  Thanks and I know I will be making again.  "
125640,28148,2006-06-14,4,"I made a lot of changes, but I was making these to use up leftovers from Recipe #89204 Crockpot Chicken W/ Blackbeans and Cream Cheese so it worked for me. I shredded the chicken and subbed the cream cheese/salsa/bean/corn mixture for the 2/3 cup picante sauce. I used a blend of cheddar and monterey jack cheese and whole wheat tortillas, and also added a little bit of steamed broccoli and 1/4 tsp each pepper and garlic salt to the filling mixture. I brushed with olive oil as some reviewers suggested and found that they actually came out a little too crisp for us, so I'll use margarine next time. Served with chili sauce. Quick, easy, and quite tasty. Thanks."
185285,28148,2006-06-16,5,"Fantastic quick meal! I used a low carb tortilla and it was great. Later in the week,I used the same technique and filled it with grilled chicken, ranch dressing, bacon bits. I topped it with grilled red onion."
37779,28148,2006-07-10,5,"After numerous changes of plans, I finally was able to make these delicious chimichangas. They were extremely easy to make and the filling was seasoned just right for me. My husband added a little hot sauce to his. My kids loved them and one was a perfect serving for them. The tortillas were flaky and just slightly crisp. Thanks, Miss Annie, for sharing this week-night friendly, very tasty recipe."
182624,28148,2006-08-01,5,"Just another happy reviewer.  I've been wanting to try these for some time and I'm very glad I finally did.  I always seem to have leftover chicken and this is a great way to use it up.  These were very easy to make and the filling is really good.  They were definitely crispy, although my husband and I agreed that they're not quite like fried - although delicious just the same - in fact, just as good as fried but without all the fat.  I added chopped cilantro to the filling and served with ""Mama's Cilantro Cream Sauce"" (#166779).  We'll definitely make these frequently.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!"
147109,28148,2006-08-18,5,"Wow, one more +5 review from our household. Thanks for this keeper!"
180090,28148,2006-09-01,5,"This was an easy recipe for healthy chimichangas! It is so fast to make with leftover chicken and it tastes great, even the leftovers. I forgot to add the green onions, but plan on using them next time. I will be making these often, thank you!"
8688,28148,2006-10-06,5,"We love Mexican Food!  So why did it take me so long to make this wonderful recipe that has gotten over 128 incredible reviews?  I sure don't know, but I did know for sure that when it come to great food, Miss Annie's recipes are the place to come.  Especially for Mexican Food, see the Queen of San Antonio!  Our Dinner tonight was exceptional and I have to say, I wasn't at all surprised by the results.  Miss Annie never lets me down!  I served this wonderful dish with Maine-iac's <a href=""/18048"">Creamy Green Chile Sauce</a> which proved to be the perfect complement.  Thanks ever so, dear, Miss Annie!!"
173579,28148,2006-12-12,3,We liked these ok.  Didn't like them as much as some of the other mexican dishes.  Thanks for posting.
377581,28148,2006-12-29,4,"I added some garlic salt and pepper. This came out crisp and good, and so easy. Thanks for posting!"
350750,28148,2007-01-01,5,Loved these! I made these with ground beef and they turned out tasty. Next time I'll try the chicken. Thanks for a great recipe.
59473,28148,2007-02-07,5,"These were delicious and so easy to put together. I had some fresh cilantro that I needed use up, so I added that as well. I served them with sour cream and salsa rice on the side. Thanks for a great recipe."
280271,28148,2007-02-16,5,"This is a quick, easy and tasty recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand. Even the left over chicken from the night before. I added a touch of cilantro on top of the sour cream. Served them with seasoned tater tots. Oh! don't forget the margarita. Update: Here it is about 1 year later (2/16/07) and this time I make them with Multi-grain tortillas. They came out execellent like normal. I also used lowfat cheddar cheese. Thanks, Miss Annie for a great recipe that can be repeated over and over again."
439797,28148,2007-03-02,5,"Very good. Everyone liked. My 10 year old asked that next time I don't use chunky salsa - he doesn't like tomatoes. Otherwise, everyone thought it was a hit!"
80998,28148,2007-05-17,4,These werre really good.  We had a bunch of left over chicken and I came across this recipe.  We will definatly make this again.  we added sourcream on top.  super easy to make as well.
55578,28148,2007-05-30,4,Yummo!
499050,28148,2007-06-01,4,Very good
207176,28148,2007-06-19,5,So easy and good! I used marinated leftover pork tenderloin and 1/2 cup cheddar and 1/2 cup mozzerella cheese since that's what I had.  They crisped nicely and were very delicious.  I baked mine about 15 minutes and they were done. I never knew I like chimichangas!Thanks for a great recipe I'll make again for sure.
489552,28148,2007-06-25,5,"I made these last week and have been searching for the recipe on site so I could rate it.
This was delicious!  delicious!
This is also one of those recipes that I've had for the first time.
Yes...I have never had Chimichangas :( Burrittos , Tacos yes....Chimichangas No (LOL)

I really liked this.
Thank you so much for a new recipe that will become one of my fav's :)"
265954,28148,2007-07-08,5,"These were excellent.  I used 4 flour tortillas, and just stuffed them.  I did not have the 25 minutes required to bake these, so I put them in a baking pan (not a baking sheet) and baked for 10 minutes.  A pan with sides will reflect heat from the sides onto the food and will cook it more quickly, but you have to be observant b/c you can burn the food quickly, too.  After I baked for 10 minutes, I sprinkled cheese on top, then some salsa and then the green onions, and baked for another 5 minutes.  It was very tasty.  Thanks for posting!"
92816,28148,2007-08-31,5,"These are very tasty.I omitted the cumin,not a big fan of it.I used Montreal Chicken Spice on the chicken and baked it in the oven.I also used whole wheat tortilla shells.These made a wonderful supper and great the next day for a work lunch."
240552,28148,2007-09-02,5,"Really easy and good! I used whole wheat tortillas and regular yellow onion, too!"
229524,28148,2007-10-08,5,Loved these. So easy to make for a weeknight dinner. Can see why this recipe is so popular.  Made Home-Style Mexican Rice (151740 ) to go with these.
227607,28148,2007-11-13,5,We loved these.  I did add some black beans and corn.  I will make a bunch of these and put in the freezer for quick meals.  YUMMY!!!
666723,28148,2007-12-28,5,"I didn't have any pre cooked chicken, so I cut up a pack of chicken tenders into bite sized pieces.  Then I dumped them into a bag full of chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and oregano and coated all the pieces.  I sauteed them in a little olive oil and then continued with the directions as followed.  These turned out so good inside... there were no left overs and I made some spicy mexican rice to go on the side.  Hubby liked his with sour cream on top and step son liked his with salsa all over it!  Delish!"
140132,28148,2008-01-19,5,"Like this recipe needs another 5 star review, but I must give credit where credit is due.  These for fantastic. I love chimis and the fact that these are baked is even better. I served these along with refried beans and spanish rice and also some tortilla chips.  On the side I setour  shredded chedder cheese, sour cream, avacado slices, black olives, green onions , jalapeno slices and salsa.  HUGE HIT  Thank you for posting.....Stephanie"
98919,28148,2008-02-24,5,My daughter-in-law made these for us last night and they were to die for.  I am not a big chicken fan anymore but these were wonderful.  This one is a keeper..thanks for sharing a great recipe.
262312,28148,2008-03-07,5,"great method!!  i always used my deep fryer for chimis, but not anymore!  in fact, i find that using this method is crispier than deep frying!  plus it's so much healthier!  thanks for the keeper!!"
242484,28148,2008-06-04,5,"Oh my, these were so good and talk about easy!  The tortillas are so crispy & delicate...excellent recipe!  I heated the leftovers in the microwave and ate it like a hot pocket the next day."
426903,28148,2008-06-13,5,"With so many reviews, what is one more, huh? These were wonderful. I have a dh who loves chicken chimis, and he loved these! I preferred how light the were compared to the heavy fried ones. I think I am gonna try it with some shredded beef next time. I combined this recipe with Recipe #276402 and it was delicious. Thanks for posting!"
13483,28148,2008-06-25,5,"Absolutely excellent.  I also just sprayed these with a Pam like butter spray and they turned out just great ...........and crispy.  I froze a couple of extras and will reheat them shortly and I am sure they, too , will be just as good and crispy as the originals.  Great recipe.  Thanks Miss Annie"
173314,28148,2008-06-29,5,loved this.... added refried bean to chicken blend.  soooo good... thankyou.  had extra cheese melted on top and more sour cream and salsa on the side for serving.  yummy
191533,28148,2008-07-19,5,"I have never made chimichangas before- this is wonderful! They look like you did so much work but they're easy! Yum! (I got 10 out of this recipe when using 6"" tortillas."
847160,28148,2008-07-30,5,tht was really good
400420,28148,2008-08-08,0,"I have to tell you that, although I have never actually made this recipe, I took your idea and have used it over and over again, whenever I have leftover meat.  I just chop it up, mix in some salsa, onions and cheese, roll 'em up and pot them in the oven!  My family loves these.  I've even served them at a get-together.  It is fast, easy and so delicious!  Thank you for such a great idea!"
248023,28148,2008-08-20,4,"A great way to use up the leftover chicken I had in the fridge!  I love the fact that they are oven fried, but they still get nice and crispy... I sprayed my pan with some olive oil before placing the chimichangas in so they wouldn't stick and then sprayed the tops (instead of the margarine).   I served them up with lots of sour cream and salsa on the side...  Delicious and easy!  Thanks for sharing!!!"
132383,28148,2008-08-24,5,I am rating this on the cooking method alone - which was FANTASTIC.  I had left over chicken filling from enchiladas I made and so decided to use that filling with cheese to make chimichangas. My husband and I both just loved this!
15521,28148,2008-09-26,5,"Super easy and really flexible.  I used morningstar chicken strips in 1/3 and cooked chicken in 2/3.  The filling is easy to mix up  ahead,and when we were ready to eat, I just popped them in the oven.  This will be a recipe I make frequently!"
88099,28148,2008-10-17,4,"This was very easy to put together and the flavors combination was really good.  The only change I made was to use chili powder instead of the cumin.  Next time, I'll add maybe some chopped jalapeno peppers to zip it up a little.  My salsa was a little on the bland side for us.  All in all a very nice recipes.  Made for ""Think Pink"""
844554,28148,2008-11-17,5,"These are definitely keepers! I also added pinto beans, garlic powder and chili powder. The only mistake I made was using the low carb tortilla since I had them open. It was still good but next time I'll use the regular ones. Thanks."
358796,28148,2008-12-15,4,These were pretty good. Very quick to put together (if using leftover rot. chicken) and they turned out crispy. Certainly not as tasty as deep fried :) but good for being baked. Next time I'll try some cilantro and maybe some white onion. Nice weeknight meal.
315055,28148,2009-01-13,3,"Food was a little bland, it needed more spices and a better topping - I had to douse it in sour cream to eat it."
142335,28148,2009-01-13,5,"I really love this recipe. It works really well to use up leftovers and to stretch a meal. The first time I made this I followed the recipe and it was great. Last night I made it using The Best Shredded Chicken (Crock Pot). I wasn't sure if I had left enough chicken out to feed everyone that was here so I used Cilantro Rice as a part filler and spread re-fried beans on the tortilla first. This came out really, really good too. It was so flavorful that no one used any toppings. I love this...Cheap and delicious! It's in my rotation and I'm having a great time tweaking it to suit what I have on hand. THANK YOU!"
218535,28148,2009-03-02,3,We didn't care for the cumin or oregano. Probably will leave those out next time. Also we got 8 chimichangas rather than 6.
74281,28148,2009-04-26,5,"So easy and really delicious. I made these exactly as directed except for the green onionos for serving. Cooked my chicken in the crockpot so it was ready when I got home from work. Topped with sour cream, shredded cheese and salsa. I knew 524 reviews before me could not be wrong!"
222564,28148,2009-08-25,5,One word; SUPERB!!!
1179225,28148,2009-08-31,5,"We thought these were great! I did add cilantro and topped them with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream. Very easy and very yummy!"
199020,28148,2009-09-23,4,A very good alternative to deep-fried chimis. I used steak instead of chicken added black beans. Thanks for sharing.
104295,28148,2009-10-04,5,"I'm review #579 so we already know these are good, but it was a wonderful use of my leftover shredded chicken that had been in the freezer.  I used some enchilada sauce and didn't measure the cheese.  My pickiest eater didn't love it, but ate some.  The rest of us liked it a lot.  Thanks!"
389431,28148,2009-10-09,5,These were great!!  Fabulous way to use up that leftover chicken from Sunday dinner!!  I will be making these again!  Thank you so much!!!
121185,28148,2009-10-18,5,"ANother review is not needed...but these were super!  My entire family loved them (including 2 chimi lovers), from the 5yo to the grandpa.  The chimi lovers said you would never know they were not fried.  :)"
532289,28148,2009-10-21,5,Excellent.  Made as directed.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Served with Mexican Rice by Pot Scrubber.  Thanks for sharing.
1122161,28148,2009-11-15,5,"These were really good! I put double the filling in 10inch tortillas and they turned out great. Nice and crispy, and the seasoning was very good. Thanks for posting!"
362983,28148,2009-12-25,5,"This was SOOO good and so easy! We had bought a roast chicken the night before so I knew this would be the perfect recipe to use up the leftovers. I didn't have green onions so I just used regular onions, and brushed the tortillas with oil instead of butter. I'll definitely have to make this again! Thanks!"
407007,28148,2010-01-23,5,"These are GREAT! :) I used low fat cheese and low carb tortillas, as well as light margarine. I omitted the green onions but sprinkled them with a little garlic powder. I used rotisserie chicken so they were super easy to prepare. I served them with Recipe #55768 which went perfectly. I think the only change I would make is to double the recipe next time so I can freeze the leftovers and have them whenever! Thank you so much for sharing!"
789516,28148,2010-02-16,5,"I used whole wheat tortillas, about 2 cups of chicken, and some hot sauce to the mix to make it spicy... will be making again"
1506604,28148,2010-03-03,5,"YYYUUUUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!

Didn't expect them to be this good but dang, call me Chef, lol..."
59163,28148,2010-04-02,5,"Am making these again tonight and realized I never reviewed it.  Althought with hundreds of reviews, does it need another? Love the simplicity of this recipe, can be made quickly on a weeknight.  Also, love the fact it's baked and not fried and tastes great.  I make these often and they are good the next day too.  I nuke them and them crisp them up in a pan on the stove with great results."
914720,28148,2010-05-09,5,"Yum! These were great, and so easy to make. I used leftover shredded chicken from recipe#89204.  I also heated the tortillas a few at a time in the microwave to make them easier to roll.  The entire family gives this five stars. Served with Cuban style black beans. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks so much for posting!"
298447,28148,2010-07-12,5,"Wow!  This is a wonderful dish worth keeping.  I used Recipe #59635 for the salsa, prepared chicken using Recipe #234465, whole wheat tortillas & sauteed onions (in place of green onions).  It was delicious!  I had a little chicken filling leftover & we ate it cold topped on Ritz crackers...yes, that was yummy, too!  Surprisingly, I had one chimi leftover & ate it cold for lunch...delicious, again!  Told my son this would be a great thing to put in his lunchbox for school lunches.  Thanks for this great, versatile recipe.  Tried & true, indeed!"
1133190,28148,2010-08-19,5,Excellent! Quick and yummy.  I didn't even have enough cheese and they still tasted great! I will be making these again!
486718,28148,2011-03-09,5,"While living in Texas I fell in love with Tex-Mex food.  Now in Rhode Island my only choice is to try to duplicate it at home.  This hit the spot, I made exactly as listed and can't wait to try it again with green enchilada sauce instead of the salsa.  So easy and so good!  Thanks!!!"
456858,28148,2011-08-30,5,"OMG!!!  These were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!  I had chimichangas for the first time (just a week ago) at a very good Mexican restaurant here in town.  They were good, but I won't be ordering them at the restaurant anymore...because I can now make my own and they are better (taste and health wise) than what the restaurant served.  This was really easy to make too.  It didn't take long at all to brown them up in my oven, ten minutes tops.  They were delish with no additional garnish.  I did have chipotle sour cream on hand, and just had to try it with the chipotle sour cream...it added a nice touch.  Will DEFINITELY be making again, and again :-) Thanks for sharing Miss Annie!!!"
1052873,28148,2012-05-12,5,"Due to a lack of communication, we had multiple rotisserie chickens in the fridge. 1.5x'd this to serve 5. Used Silver Palate Gazpacho salsa and 4 cheese Mexican cheese. Served with chopped tomatoes, avocado chunks, and sour cream. Never had 'real' chimichangas so can't compare, but these were great!"
1365025,28148,2012-06-14,5,These were soooo good! I used a chopped onion. I used margarine to brush the tops and bottoms with and they turned out nice and crispy. I cut them in half to eat. I put sour cream with chives and some more cheddar cheese on top of them and ate them like a sandwich. Yummmm! A keeper for sure.
2549237,28148,2013-01-15,4,"This made a restaurant quality meal that my whole family loved.  It taste just like something we would get from our local Mexican restaurant.  I pared it with Spanish Rice, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, guacamole and refried beans.  Thanks for a great recipe Miss Annie."
1581225,28148,2014-10-20,5,I really enjoyed these! I just wanted to keep eating them! A great way to use rotisserie chicken.
37868,15411,2002-05-20,0,"I tryed this with super chuncky peanut butter..
It did not work...I have bought smooth..Now I am ready to try them. Just wanted you to know.
Thank You"
13483,15411,2002-08-19,5,"Talk about old fashion comfort foods!!  This was fast to do, simple to make and a treat for the taste buds!!  Sure beats the commercial bought cookies!!  Thank you KyJo."
43083,15411,2003-01-21,5,yummy! next time i'm going to add peanut butter chips or chocolate chips:) thanks!
36944,15411,2004-09-09,0,I had fun making these with my two grandaughters. And the recipe is very simple and quick to put together.  But the cookies themselves were rather heavy and bland tasting and just not what I was expecting.
68884,15411,2004-11-01,5,"So easy, so good! I used half creamy & half crunchy PB (it's what i had on hand), and I threw in about 1/4 cup chocolate chips. This made exactly 12 cookies for me -- a quick, easy snack! Thanks so much for posting! :)"
189616,15411,2005-01-24,3,"from KangasTyler
Sorry I was hopping my hub. and boys would get blown away with this recipe, they said it was just o.k., I'm not a sweet food lover and thought it was alright.
I decreased sugar 1/4c.,
added a handful of milk chocolate chips, flattened dough with sugar-coated fork and baked on parchment paper instead of oiling pan, would have loved to give it 5*but couldn't"
29782,15411,2005-10-15,5,"What a very simple and easy cookie to make in a flash!!  We loved them! These are the best I have had in years.
Thanks so much for sharing this awesome  recipe! I will be making these for my boys for Halloween this year. YUM! "
168462,15411,2006-05-18,5,Kids devoured these. Thanks for such an easy recipe.
177933,15411,2006-09-03,5,Wow!  I am in shock by how easy these were and how great they tasted!  Thanks!
250031,15411,2006-12-22,5,I love this recipe. I add one teaspoon of vanilla too. You can whip up a batch of homemade cookies in no time with this recipe. And it's a great recipe for those with wheat intolerances.
27643,15411,2007-05-21,5,Amazing how good these are! Something SO simple to make. Great peanut butter taste. It's hard to leave them alone! Thanks MG!
142367,15411,2007-07-05,5,"These turned out even though I used natural peanut butter (and didn't stir in the oil enough!) and they were dripping with oil.  My kids loved them.  3 ingredients, it doesn't get much easier than that.  Thanks for the recipe!"
286851,15411,2008-01-05,5,"I have this recipe too, but I had known it as 1+1+1 123 peanut butter cookies. So easy and good!"
248023,15411,2008-01-08,3,"These tasted really good, but were quite sweet for me... My BF loved them and couldn't believe they only had 3 ingredients in them...  Great to make if you are craving something sweet and are short of ingredients to make a traditional PB cookie...thanks for sharing!"
81611,15411,2008-04-11,5,"I didn't really think these would work, but they did! I only use natural pb, and so I added a tiny amount of salt. I also used 1/2c brown sugar, 1/4c white sugar, and 1/8c stevia sugar. I was out of sucanat but I think that would work great in these too. These cookies remind me of my favorite snack from childhood--a scoop of peanut butter dipped in corn syrup. I can't wait to try these w/kisses on top...these cookies scream for chocolate."
218535,15411,2008-09-22,4,"These cookies are delicious. For less sugar, use splenda instead of sugar.I used the smallest ice-cream scoop I have and got 30 cookies instead of 18. (Recipe #10269 is a better recipe or if you want a flourless recipe use #17943)"
402559,15411,2008-12-27,5,These were a great addition to our Santa cookie plate and a HUGE time saver. Thanks!
485151,15411,2009-02-11,4,"These were good- my boys really liked them. I prefer PB cookies made with flour, but this will be good when I need a quick & easy recipe. These were too crumbly for my tastes though."
140132,15411,2009-03-04,4,So easy!  Thanks for posting.
1179225,15411,2009-09-20,5,"I made these for for a family gathering, everyone loved them and could not believe they were made with three ingredients. Mine weren't crumbly at all, just soft and delicious. This will be my PB cookie recipe from now on. Thank you for posting!"
37449,15411,2009-11-17,5,"So doggone easy! And my DH, the peanut butter lover in the house, adores them. Thanks!"
620763,15411,2010-01-07,4,"This cookie is very sweet. My kids did not like them, but husband did. I am somewhere in the middle...they hit the spot if you are craving a peanut butter cookie, but I would rather take the time and make one with a few more ingredients."
407007,15411,2010-02-08,5,"So good, and SOOOOO easy! I used reduced fat peanut butter and organic sugar. DH loved these and could hardly wait for them to cool to grab them off the rack. :) Thanks so much sharing."
632249,15411,2010-02-13,1,"Hmmmm...these turned out terrible for us.  Followed the recipe exactly but our cookies spread out so thin, making them a total mess to remove from the pan. They were hard like taffy once they cooled. I am wondering if the brand of peanut butter effects this as I see others had the same problems as I did.  Maybe you could mention the type of peanut butter you are using. Sorry to give this a low rating but it just did not work for us. I'm glad to see others had success."
173314,15411,2010-02-13,5,"Doubled recipe. rolled into balls and put in my mini muffin pan. baked about 11 minutes and pushed in my mini pb cups, rolos and kisses.  cooled and was delicious. thankyou"
371738,15411,2010-09-04,5,"Simple, quick, 3 ingredients!!!  Very easy & very quick.  I had my 8 y.o. son help me.  Awesome.  As per Chef # 812586's suggestion, I did refrigerate them about 10 minutes (while the oven was warming up) so they weren't that sticky when shaping them.  Thank you!!"
318235,15411,2011-07-20,0,Quick easy and delicious! Thank you!
103876,15411,2012-01-12,5,My daughter made these last night for my mom who is sick.  She added mini chocolate chips.  They were so easy and turned out great!  The flavor and texture was right on and you would never know that these have no flour.  Thanks for posting!
13796,15411,2012-08-07,4,I made these cookies this morning. Seemed easy enough. I used Jif creamy peanut butter and white sugar.. one large egg. I couldn't 'drop' onto cookie sheet. The mixture was just too crumbly. I had to squish it into my palms into a greasy little disk..  then I pressed into white sugar.. pressed with fork and baked. Maybe another egg would have helped..  not sure. <br/>I got 17 cookies out of the mixture. The cookies are very delicate and crumbly.<br/><br/>UPDATED the very same day. I had to give it one more star because people said they tasted good and one lady wanted the recipe.
400420,15411,2012-10-14,4,"These are super easy to make, but as some others mentioned, very sweet!  I doubled the recipe and used 3/4 brown sugar and 1/4 white.  I used a 1 tbsp scoop to make the cookes then flattened with a fork and sprinkled just a pinch of sugar on each.  I think next time, I'll use much less sugar and a pinch of salt.  I made these for DH, and he hasn't tried them yet, but I'll bet he loves them!  Thank you!"
383346,15411,2013-03-13,5,These cookies are so easy to do.  And the taste is so good.  It's hard to eat just one.  Thanks Mysterygirl :)  Made for Holiday tag game
173579,15411,2014-03-23,5,Fantastic!  Thanks for posting.
1581225,15411,2017-02-10,1,"The good thing about this recipe is that it's quick, easy, has few ingredients, and has less mess to clean. The bad, well, it tastes like what it is, peanut butter and sugar. While I do like peanut butter, I prefer that real, flour cookie taste and to me it's worth the extra effort, ingredients and mess. Also, I'm not rating this low because it didn't turn out for me, mine turned out ok and stayed together, I just think there's better recipes out there for peanut butter cookies."
169969,142464,2005-10-31,5,Lovely flavors. I used frozen brussels sprouts and let them thaw in the sink. This was quick and easy. Thanks Cookgirl.
101823,142464,2005-11-02,5,"My husband loved this prep for Brussels sprouts even better than roasting.  He isn't a citrus fan, but I gave the pan a small squeeze of lemon when he wasn't looking, and loved the way that it enhanced the flavors.  Our sprouts were a bit on the large side, and I didn't cut them in half.  In the future, I would follow the directions more closely and not skip this step.  It would allow the interior of the sprouts to caramelize and increase the flavor."
53932,142464,2005-11-19,5,Tasty indeed!  I halved the brussels sprouts for double the flavor.  The lemon juice does add the finishing touch.  Thanks for sharing.
136997,142464,2005-12-05,5,"Oh boy! These were so good. I've only ever had them cooked, so this was a surprising change. I did omit the lemon. :) "
95743,142464,2006-02-23,5,"Can't possibly add anything to the previous 29 reviews, so I'll just say these are terrific."
37449,142464,2006-04-14,5,My DH  and I really enjoyed this recipe! Lots of flavor and loved the garlic!
131021,142464,2006-08-25,5,These were absolutely fabulous. My dh wasn't as enamored with them as I was (he only tolerates brussel sprouts) but he did eat all of his :-)
125640,142464,2006-09-15,2,"I made this as directed, including halving the brussel sprouts, but we just weren't that impressed which really surprised me as so many brussel sprout haters said they were converted by this recipe and we already like brussel sprouts. I don't know. Maybe these didn't turn out like they were supposed to. It seems easy to get it wrong when 4 out of 6 ingredients don't list even approximate amounts. And I assume that the brussel sprouts were supposed to only take 10 minutes to cook based on the prep and cook times listed, but they were still underdone after 20 minutes. Was I supposed to be using thawed, frozen brussel sprouts or something? Instead of inspriring rave reviews in my house, this just inspired DH to suggest I cook brussel sprouts the same way I cook asparagus because he thought it would be ""good that way"". Hint taken. Really sorry."
362983,142464,2007-03-17,5,"I love how simple this recipe is. I made the mistake of putting my heat up too high so some of my sprouts burned a bit, but I'll watch them more carefully next time. (And they were still tasty!) I love the addition of the lemon juice. Thank you!"
286851,142464,2008-01-01,5,"I am rating these for my husband, as I despise brussel sprouts and would give them a negative rating any way they were prepared--haha! But this is a simple, easy way to prepare them that my husband LOVES. We don't add the lemon juice, just the salt and pepper."
207176,142464,2008-03-03,5,Terrific sprouts!  I liked the easy prep.  I used vegetable oil because it was out and left out the lemon juice.  DH and I ate then up! Thanks for posting Cookgirl!
1072593,142464,2009-01-02,5,"This is some good stuff!  The entire batch was consumed by a party of 3 and some were looking for more.  Oh, thumbs up on the lemon!"
280271,142464,2009-01-21,5,This is packed full of flavor. I just love it. I like your addition of the lemon juice. Very easy to prepare. Thanks for posting. :)
844554,142464,2009-03-30,5,These were very good! Didn't feel like heating up the oven which is how I usually make brussel sprouts so this was a perfect alternative. Thanks so much.
140132,142464,2009-06-04,5,"Holy Cow these are good.  I made them this evening for supper and we LOVED them.  I did add a dollop of butter in them at the end but we didn't need it.  Thank you for sharing this ""oh so yummy"" recipe."
88099,142464,2010-05-21,4,"This is a great way to fix brussel sprouts, even for those that don't like them.  Loved the adition of the lemon.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for ZWT #6 :)"
226863,142464,2010-05-23,5,"Love, love brussel sprouts, but cooked at medium heat on my stove, they would burn.  So I did need to adjust the temp, but otherwise made these as posted.  I really enjoyed them, but I've never met a brussels sprout I didn't like! Thanks for sharing!"
383346,142464,2010-05-26,5,These are great to be almost plain.  I made half recipe and used 1 garlic clove.  I didn't use lemon juice.  I also sliced the brussels sprouts.  Thanks Cookgirl :)  Made for the Zwizzle Chicks of ZWT
251917,142464,2010-06-28,5,ZWT6 Family Picks: Delicious - love the crunchy caramelized leaves!! Who knew Sprouts could be this good?
26512,142464,2010-07-06,5,"Delicious sprouts. I cut the olive oil back to about a tablespoon and used black pepper and a bit of onion powder. Easy and healthy, thanks for the recipe."
400708,142464,2010-10-24,5,I LOVED this recipe.  I've never fried brussel sprouts before and this sounded so differant.  Finally got around to trying it last night and it went together so easy.  I did add some sauted onions to the mix at the beginning and then followed the directions exactly.  The addition of the garlic and lemon gave it just the right flavor.  Thanks so much for posting.
176615,142464,2012-01-03,5,Yum! Enjoyed these for dinner tonight. Easy and delicious. Didn't add the lemon juice. A  faster alternative to roasting. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
369715,142464,2013-06-11,4,These were easy to make. I followed the recipe as written but for us we thought they needed a touch of butter. We enjoyed them.
47907,92072,2004-10-17,5,Excellent recipe!  I made it exactly as posted except I only used 3 chicken breast halves and sprinkled some garlic powder over the top of the rolls before baking.  This is a great dish for company or a family meal.  It was easy to put together and the flavor is wonderful.  Thank you for posting!
121185,92072,2004-12-09,5,"Quick - easy - and loved by my whole family of 5...We used 4 chick breasts, 2 T butter and were heavy on the garlic powder (we didn't have garlic salt)- This is a keeper!!!"
101034,92072,2004-12-10,5,"This was a delicious chicken dish. I used fresh grated asiago cheese instead of parmesan and fresh garlic, but other than that followed everything else exactly as written. I did cut the recipe in half, as there were just the two of us. We had the leftovers for lunch and they tasted just as moist and delicious. This is a keeper. Thanks Claudia!"
42720,92072,2004-12-16,4,"I made this recipe using 4 chicken breasts; scaling the ingredients in half.  I didn't have any parsley so I used 1/2 teaspoon of mexican oregano in the butter sauce.  After pre-heating my oven and baking covered, as directed, and then uncovered for 15 minutes, the chicken was not browned and did not look done.   I'm always nervous about undercooked chicken, so at that point I checked the internal temperature of the chicken with my meat thermometer and it was 150°. I left it in the oven an additional 10 minutes until it reached an internal temperature of 170° and was a nice golden brown on the outside.  The chicken was very delicious, nicely seasoned and still moist. I will definitely be making this again as my family really enjoyed it. I am sorry I cannot echo all the 5 star reviews because I really like this recipe.  My concern is that the cooking time given in the recipe is inadequate and combined with your statement in the intro ""Just be sure not to overcook as the chicken will be dry - follow these directions and the chicken will be moist."" could be confusing for inexperienced cooks.  Chicken breasts should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 170° to avoid dangerous foodborne bacteria.  I felt it was important to note this because the total cooking time of 45 minutes was not long enough to assure the chicken was completely done. "
51011,92072,2005-01-10,5,"These were super easy, and super good! The chicken was soooo moist!  The only changes I made was that I added a bit of basil to the breadcrumbs, and I used fresh garlic in the butter.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!"
176615,92072,2005-03-14,5,"Flavorful chicken. Very easy to prepare and would be a good choice to make ahead. I used butter and fresh garlic for the butter sauce, fresh toasted breadcrumbs for the coating. My chicken breasts were small to medium in size and the recipe performed exactly as stated, they were done through but still moist. Thanks, Claudia Dawn!"
9869,92072,2005-03-22,5,"Wow!! This is really good, my husband isnt a great chicken fan..but he has realised over the past 32 years that it is part of our weekly meat as its one of my favourites.
Tonight after this meal he put his fork down and said 'that meal was fit for a king' I looked at him and said..you do reaalise it was chicken?
You betcha I do..and it was great! was the reply.
Very simple to make and such a nice presented meal.
Thank you for sharing.
"
52262,92072,2005-04-02,5,My guests thought the chicken looked and tasted like the kind you get in a restaurant.  I used Cojack cheese and secured the chicken rolls with toothpicks.  An easy recipe with beautiful results!
37305,92072,2005-04-08,5,"Wow!  These came out great!  I used 2.5 lb. of thinly sliced chicken cutlets and got 10 rolls out of the batch.  I added minced garlic to the butter sauce and since I didn't have a whole cup of cheese, I used parmesan bread crumbs. I also added garlic powder to the crumbs, instead of garlic salt, but I did add salt and pepper.  I only had shredded Cheddar-Jack, so I used that and it worked out fine...I just tried to keep the cheese away from the edges.  The time was right on for me.  I had some extra butter sauce, so I drizzled that over the chicken before baking.  I did check with an instant-read thermometer and the chicken was tender and juicy. Everyone loved them and I will be making them again.  Thanks for sharing!"
39301,92072,2005-05-07,5,"This dish was very enthusiastically received by everyone in my family and sure to become a regular part of our dinner lineup.  I love when something relatively simple tastes so good.  Like another reviewer, I had only shredded cheddar jack on hand and it worked beautifully.  The cooking times are definitely right on - the chicken was moist and delicious.  Thanks for sharing this one!"
29782,92072,2005-07-11,5,This was a very delicious recipe. I have had it in my book for awhile and finally decided to give it a try. The cheese is really what caught my eye on the photo. I love cheese!  The flavor of this recipe is awesome though!  I know I will be making this again many of times. Thanks for sharing it with us!
173579,92072,2006-03-17,5,"WOW! This was wonderful.
We loved the monterey jack cheese that was in it.  Very good garlic flavor also.  Will be making this over and over.  Thanks fpr posting.

"
125640,92072,2007-01-31,5,"Easy and delicious. This chicken turned out so moist and tender. The only changes I made were that I used colby jack for half of the chicken and I added a tsp of crushed garlic to the butter mixture. I also used garlic and herb seasoned breadcrumbs. I'd like to try different flavors of cheese, but in general this ones a keeper.
Update - I tried this again with half provolone and half pepper jack. The provolone is my favorite so far. I know a lot of other reviewers have enjoyed this with pepper jack, but I thought it overwhelmed the other flavors a bit much."
312577,92072,2007-02-04,5,"It looks and smells like a gourmet restaurant in my kitchen!  I followed the recipe, but added real garlic and a thin slice of ham.  I served it with the tasty buns recipe #35889.  I will be making this next week for my dad when he comes for a visit.  This a great recipe!!  Thank you Claudia."
377581,92072,2007-05-02,4,Very good and very easy. A definate keeper! Thank you for posting.
269331,92072,2007-06-04,5,"I used store bought thin sliced chicken fillets pounded slightly.  I was afraid the cooking time may be too long because I only had 6 fillets, but it turned out perfect and so moist!  The only problem I had was a lot of the cheese oozed out.  I think next time I will use provolone, it doesnâ€™t melt as quick.  Yummy recipe!"
499050,92072,2007-08-17,5,Yum!
58836,92072,2007-10-14,5,"Yum, Yum, Yum.  Made this for a progressive dinner we had last night.  I doubled the recipe and used different kinds of cheese.  Everyone really liked it.  The only problem I have is that the cheese seems to melt out of the chicken.  Doesn't take away the great taste but wish there was some way to fix that.  Guess you need to just fold the breast like a burrito!!  Thanks"
187373,92072,2007-10-19,5,Great chicken! We used colby jack cheese...delicious! Thanks for the recipe!
251917,92072,2008-01-16,5,A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!! My husband and I devoured these!! The combination is perfect!
222433,92072,2008-05-04,5,"Just realized I never rated these. Really, really good. Your right...garlic,butter and cheese..what could be better! Thanks!"
486718,92072,2008-06-16,5,"These were wonderful.  I didn't get them as thin as I would have liked but I was in a hurry.  Hubby and I both enjoyed these.  I am always looking for new chicken receipes and this one was great.
Thanks!!"
369715,92072,2008-09-01,5,Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written and everyone enjoyed them.
632249,92072,2009-01-08,5,"This was totally a hit at our house! The kids are raving about it!  They even had seconds which is saying alot as they are not the biggest eaters.  I did have troubles pounding and rolling the breasts, apparently I am quite the klutz at that. Every time I do it I end up with a bit of a mess.  So I used toothpicks to hold the rolls together but the cheese leaked out. So in the final 10 minutes I put some cheddar cheese on top to melt.
It is true that looks aren't everything cause they tasted marvelous. I did find the breasts took a bit longer to cook than stated. (Closer to an hour for me.)  Anyways, long story short... I will be making these again and again. Thx Claudia Dawn."
653438,92072,2009-03-09,5,"I fixed this for dinner a week ago and forgot to post my review.  Fabulous...I used seasoned panko crumbs (for extra crunch), fresh garlic in the butter, and some minced garlic and jalapenos with the cheese for a little more flavor.  Delicious.  Great recipe to make as is or change and use what a person has in the cupboard.  Thank you!  P.S. I cut the recipe in half."
969481,92072,2009-04-04,5,"This turned out wonderful! I used italian breadcrumbs and substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt (though I think fresh garlic would be best). I couldn't find just plain monterey jack cheese, so I used sliced pepperjack cheese. I also had to cook mine a bit longer as it wasn't done after 45 minutes (it could have been the chicken breasts size). All in all a definate keeper and will be making this again. Thanks!"
839492,92072,2009-04-05,5,"This is a recipe that I've been making for several years now. The only thing different with mine is that I add a slice of green chile to the filling (wrap it around the cheese and then wrap the breast around the cheese wrapped chile.) It gives it a nice ""Mexican"" flare."
140132,92072,2011-01-09,5,Oh my goodness....this is so good.  I made this for our supper tonight and we loved it.  The breading on the chicken was super yummy and how can you beat chicken stuffed with cheese??  Thank you so much for a meal my family ALL loved.
88099,78814,2004-09-24,3,"Although these tasted great, there is way too much chicken filling for the stated 8 oz Crescent Rolls.  You only need about half of what this recipe calls for."
76951,78814,2004-10-18,5,"These are fantastic!!  Pure comfort food.  I sprinkled with paprika to give them a little color and chose swiss cheese.  To die for!  I think that the average serving would be at LEAST 2 rolls per person, making the total servings at 4 instead of 6.  I agree with the other reviewers that the recipe should have called for 2 packages of crescent rolls based on the amount of chicken stuffing.  I didn't have a problem with the extra chicken however, since I added a little dill and put it on some lettuce leaves for my lunch for the next day.  Delicious!  Thanks, Kittencal.  I'll be making this often."
149363,78814,2004-11-03,5,"Boy oh boy was this GREAT!
I used the Jumbo Crescent rolls, used a large shallow baking dish and cooked it for 20 minutes longer than stated and they were not soggy at all!
I added cut up raw broccoli to the casserole dish, it cooked in the sauce, and also served it with rice. Very flling!
Here's a tip: I cooked a great recipe 3 nights ago called Swiss Chicken #46886 by ~Fauve~
I used the leftover chicken and stuffing from that, and mixed it up with the cream cheese and onion mixture, spooned it all on the crescent rolls and voila...my family did not know they were eating leftovers!
Thanks for sharing!"
40961,78814,2004-11-09,5,I made this dish last night. It was delicious. I used two cans of the rolls as suggested and I used onion/chive cream cheese instead of plain with a chopped onion. My husband loved it too. Thanks for a 10 star recipe.
126440,78814,2004-11-15,5,"Made this yesterday for dinner.  It is excellent.  I used poached chicken breasts, low fat cheese, low fat cream cheese, and fat-free half and half. The taste is awesome. You must try this one.  "
47559,78814,2004-11-17,5,"This dish got rave reviews from the family tonight, along with requests to make it again soon.  I admit I hesitated to try it because I'm typically not a fan of creamy cheesy meat dishes, but the picture looked so good, and the reviews helped convince me to try it.  I'm so glad I did.  I had left over chicken mixture after filling the crescent rolls, so I used a casserole that was a little too big, and filled the gaps between the crescent rolls with the extra chicken combined with frozen peas, then covered it all with the rest of the sauce and cheese.  The peas worked very well, and it was a complete meal in one dish.  Thanks so much for sharing this winner."
169969,78814,2004-12-02,5,"I planned on making this last night for me and by BF when my friend’s daughter called and said she was coming over. Since she is vegetarian I made two different dishes; one with the chicken mixture (with chopped fresh spinach) and the other with spinach, onion and broccoli (using Cream of Mushroom Soup). After reading all the reviews I only put a small amount of the cream mixture in the bottom of the baking dish and I used the jumbo crescent rolls. The chicken mixture was easy to pour but the Cream of Mushroom was too thick to pour….so I added some Fat Free Half and Half to the baking dish. They were not soggy at all and both cooked perfectly. Also, all the mixture fit into the jumbo rolls! OMG were these the bomb!!! My friend’s daughter said she is going to eat them everyday and that it was the best thing she had ever eaten. She begged me to show her how to make them and took the leftovers home. This was definitely a hit at my house!********"
64203,78814,2004-12-02,5,"I can easily see why these are in the top 40 recipes on Zaar. They are so easy to put together and taste so great! Based on the advice of Kittencal and other reviewers, I didn't place my rolls in the mixture. Instead, I baked the chicken rolls for 15 minutes then poured the sauce over the rolls and baked for an additional 15 minutes. Delicious! I probably added a bit more cheese than the recipe called for(Mozzarella and Cheddar)and the result was tremendous! Thanks for sharing this delicious and easy recipe Kittencal! Kristen"
146486,78814,2005-01-03,5,What a great recipe!  I love the sauce that goes in this and it is such an easy fast meal to throw together in a hurry!
35526,78814,2005-01-05,5,This was very very good.  Had an abundance of stuffing and plenty of sauce.  I can't wait to make it with spinach and water chestnuts!!!!
52543,78814,2005-01-12,5,All I can say is WOW!! I rarely cook with canned soup or packaged pastry but I'll be doing this again. I scaled it in half as there's just the 2 of us & followed Crabzilla's suggestion about omitting the sauce on the bottom. I added salt & pepper to the both the chicken mixture & the sauce and sprinkled paprika on top to improve the colour. My cheese of choice was colby with chives & I served with a side salad for a quick & easy mid week dinner. Adding some diced celery to the leftover chicken mixture will make a great sandwich for lunch today. Thanx so much for posting Kitten!
101034,78814,2005-01-18,5,"These were really good!! After reading all the reviews I had an idea of what to do and what not to do and they turned out perfect. I had two cans of crescent rolls on hand, since everyone said how much this makes, but after tasting the chicken mixture, I decided to only use the one can and save the leftover chicken to use tomorrow either on a bed of lettuce or as sandwiches.....it's delicious!! I didn't put any sauce on the bottom of the baking pan, instead I greased the pan with some butter. To the soup mixture I added a sprinkle of cayenne and to the chicken mixture I also added a few sprinkles of cayenne and used scallion instead of onion. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe as written, using swiss cheese. We both enjoyed this very much and I know I'll be making this again."
178742,78814,2005-01-21,5,"I made these for dinner Tuesday.. They turned out really good. Husband took leftovers to lunch the next day.. I went with the majority of the reviewers and did ""not"" put the sauce on the bottom of the pan. Everyone said they turned out alittle soggy that way.. So, I just spooned the sauce over the ones I ate, and let husband put his own sauce over his.. And you definitely do need 2 packages of cresent roll.. I would even go with three.. or cook less chicken.. I seasoned my chicken and just cooked it on top of the stove in olive oil until they were done.. This recipie were really good and easy.. Thanks for sharing!"
37036,78814,2005-02-14,4,This was very good and a nice change from my normal chicken dishes.  I used Arrostook's Condensed Soup Mix # 25653 in place of the cream of chicken soup.  Served with white rice and a fresh tossed salad.  Thanks Kittencal!
146047,78814,2005-01-26,5,"Kittencal, I enjoyed this recipe so much, and my picky husband declared it a keeper. Fortunately this is a very forgiving recipe as I absentmindedly blended the butter (light by Land O Lakes) and cream cheese (neufchatel) together with the sauce ingredients (substituted thickened evaporated milk for the can of soup). I used about 1/4 c of the sauce to moisten the chicken/onion mixture, filled the rolls, then set them up to bake ""naked"" (i.e., no sauce in the baking dish) for about 10 minutes. I poured the rest of the sauce on top after that and the bottoms did not become soggy as other reviewers have observed-- perhaps the naked baking maneuver helped. In any case, this was a really satisfying meal, tasty served alongside roasted asparagus. Thanks for posting, Kittencal. :)  P.S. rickie's ""To Die for Crescent Rolls"" #35267 were great in this. "
56087,78814,2005-02-04,5,"FINALLY got to try this highly reviewed recipe and was NOT let down.  My husband devoured it, my 6 year old Grandson did the same and asked ""How'd you make this so good"".  I had leftover chicken so next time will get another package of Cresent Rolls, or freeze the leftover meat for later.  Thanks for sharing this absolutely delicious, easy recipe."
36944,78814,2005-02-18,5,This is an easy recipe to prepare and it results in a delicious entree with a nice creamy sauce.  I poured all the sauce over the top as recommended by some of the other reviewers.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us KITTENCAL!
172369,78814,2005-02-25,5,very good-non left at my house. Thanks for a great recipe.
184723,78814,2005-03-13,5,"Easy and good, very very good! "
8688,78814,2005-04-12,4,"This is a very good recipe and worth holding on to!  I used shredded mozzarella, but think next time I will use the cheddar as it will provide more flavor.  I also think that the next time I make this recipe that I will put all the sauce over the crescent rolls because even though I baked for a longer period of time, some of the rolls still came out doughy on the bottom. The flavor was wonderful!  I can see this chicken filling used with phyllo-pastry cups, using the same sauce.  This would prevent the doughiness I experienced. I will definitely make this recipe again!  Thanks, Kittencal!"
97579,78814,2005-06-21,5,"This was very delicious.  I wish I would have read the reviews because I doubled this recipe and it was way to much.  I definately agree that 2 cans of crescent rolls would be perfect for the amount of the chicken recipe.  I did notice that my crescent rolls seemed doughy, which is probably because so much of the sauce on them.  So I will definately make it again only doubling the crescent rolls this time.  Thanks!    "
158086,78814,2005-06-23,5,Wish I could give this more than 5 stars...smelled wonderful and was a great recipe for all the left over chicken I had...thanks
173579,78814,2005-12-12,5,This was a very good casserole.  I did use the chive and onion cream cheese. It was wonderful.  I put all the cream of chicken mixture on the top.  Was not soggy this way.  My family is already wanting this again.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
60989,78814,2006-01-16,4,This was very good and rich. Mine took about 10 minutes longer to cook completely. The men in my family just loved it. Thanks!
138429,78814,2006-01-17,5,Wonderful recipe! Everyone loved these. I used  some old White cheddar cheese as well as mild cheddar. Made recipe exactly as stated and perfect they were. Will be making these again soon. Thank-you!
175824,78814,2006-01-26,5,This is wonderful. I used creme of celery soup because that is what I had. It was delicious. The leftovers were super heated up the next day. Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful and easy recipe.
174991,78814,2006-01-31,5,"Does this recipe need another review?  Here it goes anyways.  They are wonderful. I used 2 cans of cresent rolls with the filling amount in the recipe.  I greased a pan, put the filled cresent rolls on the pan and put about 1 Tlb. of sauce over each roll.  When served, I put the rest of the sauce in a bowl, next to the rolls, in case someone wanted additional sauce."
222433,78814,2006-02-18,5,Super recipe Kittencal! I rolled up a couple for my 7 yr old before I added the onions to the mix. I baked them for 15-20 min then added the sauce and cheese and baked for 10 min more. Everyone loved them. I have made many of your recipes and every one of them has been absolutely awesome! Thanks!
251917,78814,2006-04-12,5,AWESOME!! I followed the directions except I cooked the rolls with filling in over about 15 minutes without the sauce on them to crisp them and then another 10-15 minutes with the sauce - PERFECT!!
229850,78814,2006-03-28,5,"These were fabulous!!!!!! I poured the soup over all, none on bottom of pan after reading reviews. They were perfect, easy and to die for. Thanx for great recipe."
58836,78814,2006-04-10,5,"Made these for a church dinner and had lots of requests for the recipe.  I used 2 cans of rolls, no onion, added some chopped spinach to the chicken mixture. I stuffed and rolled and put in dish a day before and put in fridge.  Baked for 15 minutes, took out poured sauce over and baked another 15 minutes.  They were very good.  I used swiss cheese and cream of celery soup.  Will probably use different cheese next time.  Thanks for a tasty dish."
269331,78814,2006-05-08,5,Yummy!  I did not put the sauce on the bottom and used green onion and swiss cheese.  I also made these with the new 50% larger “big and flakey” crescent dinner rolls (quantity 6) and used all the filling okay.   Good enough for company!
222055,78814,2006-07-26,5,"Time for a new review on this one as I have made it before. This is very good as we can see by the star rating. I made this a second time adding in leftovers of Kittencals Spinach Parmesian Rice Bake <a href=""/96886"">Kittencal's Spinach Parmesan Rice Bake</a>. This goes to show you that you can definetly experiment with your leftovers. It was great! Thank You Kittencal!"
199020,78814,2006-09-23,4,"This was very good. The only change I made was to add mushrooms to the chicken and cream cheese.  I think it would be good served as an appetizer as well, without the soup mixture. "
187281,78814,2006-11-04,4,"Yummy dish but I didn't bake the rolls in the sauce.  Rather, I stuffed the crescent rolls with chicken and baked.  After they were done I mixed together the sauce ingredients, heated in the microwave, and poured one tbsp over each roll.  It was just enough sauce to make them creamy and delicious!"
140132,78814,2006-12-15,5,"Excellent recipe!  I had some leftover chicken from previous meal and found this recipe.  Oh so good. I doubled the recipe, but only used one can of soup and it turned out perfect for us, that you so much for this wonderful way to use up leftover chicken.   Stephanie"
125640,78814,2006-12-22,5,"The 3rd time was the charm on this one. These were good to start with, but I've played with them a bit to perfect them to our tastes. I used garlic butter crescent rolls, cream of chicken with herbs soup and cheddar cheese. In the filling I used green onions and added 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, 1/8 teaspoon paprika, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. I cooked the rolls for 15 minutes by themsleves and for another 15 minutes with the sauce on top. No more problem with soggy, undercooked rolls, the sauce was rich, and the taste was great. In the past I've also tried subbing spinach for the chicken and cream of broccoli for the soup and it made a very nice vegetarian version. Very nice, very versatile recipe. Thanks."
136997,78814,2006-12-29,5,"Well, what more can be said about this recipe? Just a couple of things maybe LoL! I didn't add sauce on the bottom and baked it 10 min. more then suggested. My husband mmmmm'd his way thru the entire dinner. I believe if there hadn't been the 3 of us, he would have eaten half himself.:)"
226863,78814,2006-12-29,3,"I thought this was good for a ""kid"" feast, but not really good for an adult meal. I can see it being served successfully at a spend-the-night party for kids, especially if you leave the onions out and use the shredded cheese. I'm not a big fan of crescent rolls though, so that may have influenced my opinion.  On the other hand, I love chicken/turkey and cream cheese, so I had high hopes for the recipe.  For adults, I thought there was way too much sauce, and the rolls were soggy, even though I baked them by themselves for 15 minutes.  I would follow other reviewer's advice and have them serve the sauce ""on the side"", and not cook the rolls with it.  The sauce was a bit overpowering and made the rolls soggy.  I'll try this one again with some alterations.  It has promise, just needs a little tweaking."
182624,78814,2007-01-08,1,"Having finally made this recipe after wanting to for some time, I'm sorry to say that it was a disappointment for me.  I didn't care for the way the crescent rolls cooked in the sauce at all.  I didn't have chicken, but I enjoyed the filling without it.  I tried adding salmon to half and liked that as well.  For me, the problem is strictly that baking the sauce is not a good combo with the rolls.  I'm going to make it again but drizzle some of the sauce over the top after baking or use no sauce at all."
236170,78814,2007-03-20,5,One of the best comfort foods ever invented! Thank you Kitten for posting this. We first made it a few years ago and it's been a regular on our rotation ever since. Kind of high in calories but you can substitute lower fat ingredients and it's still delicious.
80998,78814,2007-04-19,5,"I have wanted to try this recipe for awhile.  I didn't think my family would love it, but thought I would.  All you moms and wives know we cook more for our loved ones than ourselves.  Well, to my shock my family loved it.  My husband said it was outstanding and that it should become a regular meal for our family.  I followed the directions exactly, but added about 6 minutes to the cooking time.  I also, let it sit for about 15 mintues before serving.  This dish was perfect!  Thanks!"
265954,78814,2007-07-12,4,"This is a yummy recipe, although it has quite a number of steps and takes a bit to make.  I added two small cans of sliced mushrooms, and I also seasoned the filling with about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.  The mushrooms added a nice consistency to the chicken and cream chease filling.  I also used 1/4 cup chopped green onion, and a 1/4 cup chopped yellow onion.  Kittencal, thanks for this great recipe."
218535,78814,2008-03-31,2,My rolls were soggy even after cooking for an additional 10 minutes.
74652,78814,2007-09-29,4,I needed to re-review since I made these again  and they turned out great!  Very cheesy and yummy!Not soggy at all like first time. I butterd the bottom of the pan as one other reviwer suggested and put just a liitle sauce on top and they turned out crispy like I wanted.  A grea recipe that just needs to be played with a little to suit ones own liking.
252816,78814,2007-11-02,0,ok
132383,78814,2007-11-10,5,"We loved this!  We forgot about it because we forgot to rate it, but when we were putting together a cookbook for family, we wanted to include this and found it.  Thanks for posting!"
312577,78814,2008-09-19,5,"I have been waiting to make this recipe for a long time! I doubled the recipe and coated my chicken with bread crumbs before cooking the chicken.  Like others, I used the garlic and herb cream cheese and added fresh diced garlic to the filling.  The sauce is not to be skipped - it is delicious!  I read through the reviews, but found that you had incorporated some of the suggestions and there was no need to read all 313 reviews. This is a divine recipe!  Thank you for another wonderful Kitten meal!"
969481,78814,2008-11-26,5,"What a unique recipe! I also used the large crescent rolls as previously suggested and they worked perfectly. Other substitutions included fat free mayo for the whipping cream, fat free cream cheese for regular cream cheese, canned fat free chunk chicken for cooked chicken breasts, sharp cheddar cheese vs. mild for the filling, and pepper jack cheese in lieu of cheddar rolled up in the crescent. Excelent recipe!"
377039,78814,2008-12-18,0,"Oh, I was so disappointed with these. I should have paid more attention to the reviews, and so I won't make a star rating.  This is the first time I've made a Kittencal recipe that just didn't work for me.  I used Turkey in the filling (and didn't care for the flavor, should definitely use chicken) but the problem was the sauce/dough.  I simply couldn't get it to COOK all the way through.  I did put sauce under and over the rolls, and I filled the rolls far too full thinking it would be very casserole-like in texture and would be okay -- but it wasn't.  The dough simply would not cook; I ended up burning the top and sides and the middle was still totally, completely raw.

I still think this is a great idea, but if I try again it will be with the sauce served on the side, and I will halve (or less) the filling.  I filled two cans of crescent rolls very VERY plumply (TOO MUCH) and there was still a lot left over.

I'm sure this was my mistake; as I filled the rolls too much and used way too much sauce. I may try again sometime, but we ordered pizza tonight."
262312,78814,2009-01-11,5,"fantastic!  i've had this saved forever and finally got around to making it!  this is a great make ahead dish, which i love!  the only changes i made were to add minced garlic, serrano peppers and fresh parsley to the filling, and i used leftover rotisserie chicken.  i decided to just bake the crescents and drizzle the sauce on as i served it and served with more sauce on the side.  oh and i did play around with the sauce a bit, adding garlic powder, lots of black pepper and fresh parsley.  next time i will try the jumbo crescents and bake the rolls in the sauce as written.  thanks for another keeper carol!!! the flavors are really outstanding.  bravo!"
358796,78814,2009-01-27,0,"I made this awhile back, but forgot if we liked it or not. I think it was good, but if I try it again I'll update my review."
103876,78814,2010-11-30,5,Wow!  We loved this recipe!  I made with canned chicken and all reduced fat ingredients and it was still very rich and delicious.  Also very easy to make the pieces ahead.  I'm sure I will make again and again.  Thanks for posting!
1365025,78814,2009-10-21,5,"Oh yum! I thought I really messed this recipe up but in the end everything was great. Wouldn't you know I had everything on hand but the cream cheese. I was not about to leave the warmth of my house today to go to town. The temp. here was 40, very windy and it poured all day long. So I substituted using 2 Tb of sour cream and 2 Tb of the cream of chicken soup. It was delicious. I only made a half batch and had enough left over to spread on 3 crackers."
1179225,78814,2010-03-06,5,Mmmmm.....this is such a great idea. I'm looking forward to making it again and mixing it up a little. I brought the leftovers to work to reheat for lunch and they were just as good. Thanks so much for posting!
227607,78814,2010-04-02,5,This turned out better than I thought it would.  I tasted the chicken mixture by itself and was not real impressed but went ahead and made it up.  I did not put any of the mix on the bottom.  Just buttered the dish well then just put a little on top of each crescent.  They turned out GREAT!!  Even picky husband said they were good and all the kids loved them.
187373,78814,2010-04-08,4,"These were pretty good. I made a half recipe.  They had a slightly artificial taste, so if I were to make again, might just saute some fresh garlic with the onion instead of using powder.  Was good for lunch served with fresh green beans."
529278,78814,2010-10-16,4,"Great meal on a cool day.  Made the sauce on the side because of the kids.  My 5 year old ate 2 rolls in less than 10 minutes - and usually he takes a good 45 minutes at least for a meal, so he must have really liked it!!"
232480,78814,2010-11-22,0,"Followed the recipe exactly - ended up with 12 rolls.  They came out a little soggy but were still good.  I'm not sure I'll make them again, though - they were good, just not quite what I was expecting. *EDIT 11/22/10*  I had no intention of making these again but kept seeing all these glowing reviews for them so I gave them another shot.  It's been 5 years since my initial review and I had not made them since.  I still am not changing my original star review, however, I wanted to say that I halved the recipe this time, which worked very well.  And, my 3 year old and 1 year old ate them happily.  Enough said - I'll make them again just because of that!"
369715,78814,2011-04-02,3,I liked this but the rest of the family didn't. I made the sauce but only put some on the top and didn't put any on the bottom of the pan. I did use the garlic but only 1/2 teaspoon and the rest of my family said that was all they could taste. I did omit the seasoning salt and only used 1/2 cup of cheese in the filling. It was something different. I also had to cook mine for 50 minutes to get the dough cooked.
914720,78814,2011-09-30,5,"This was a nice treat.  I used leftover turkey, with reduced fat crescent rolls, and light cream cheese.  I also subbed sour cream for the mayonnaise.  Since I only made half a batch, I skipped the sauce, but Id like to try it on the side next time.  Served with a spinach salad and roasted butternut squash.  Thanks for sharing!"
315055,78814,2012-12-18,5,"First time I made this I didn't quite care for it, but my mom made this again and it was like eating chicken cheesecake and soo yummy!  I would definitely add veggies or extra chicken to give it more substance in the future, though."
13796,78814,2014-04-16,4,The first bite... we we not happy.....    second bite...   well. yes.   I can eat this...   third bite..   yes.. we like it.  It&#039;s a good concept....  it needs veggies...    and some other flavor.....    it was a little too &#039;processed&#039; if that&#039;s a flavor.....   I know &#039;processed&#039; is not a flavor..  but some of you will know what I mean.
1581225,78814,2017-02-07,4,"Both my husband and I enjoyed this, but unfortunately none of the kids did. Because of that, and the fact it was a lot of work for me (I made my own crescent roll dough from scratch because we can't buy store bought here) I probably wouldn't make it again. I have a bit of the chicken filling mix left because I must have misjudged the amount in the centre of each roll, and I plan on using it in twice baked potatoes because I loved the flavour so much."
49304,33489,2003-01-17,5,"Delicious, we love cole slaw, this is really good, Does taste like KFC's. Thank you for posting."
27643,33489,2003-01-21,5,"YUM! This is by far the best cole slaw I've made in a long time! Tastes a LOT like the Colonels!! Easy to make. We will have this one often. Thanks for another great recipe, Sharlene!"
47559,33489,2003-04-25,5,I've been making this recipe for years.  In my opinion it can't be beat.  I don't recommend making any changes.
32058,33489,2003-05-25,5," Very much like the Colonels.  I used light mayo and skim milk
(1/2 c. since I didn't have buttermilk) and it was great!  TY for an excellent recipee for BBQ season."
35526,33489,2003-06-10,5,"This was really good with low fat mayo. I chopped and mixed by hand, no processor.  It was a little sweet at first but later it mellowed out and was perfect.  I served with grilled chicken."
81611,33489,2004-08-04,5,"Absolutely MAAAAHVELOUS! The perfect coleslaw! I haven't ever made such a great slaw. My husband and mother-in-law raved over it; we ate it with real KFC chicken. It only sat in the fridge for about 2 hours, but tasted just fine. I won't let my kids give their rating, but then again I've never known small children to be fond of coleslaw. Suffice to say that 3 adults ate a huge bowl of this stuff and liked it better than the ""real"" KFC version. THANKS, Sharlene~W!"
22015,33489,2005-03-20,5,This is a great cole slaw recipe for creamy slaw.    I tend to eat it quickly because it gets juicier as it sits and I like my cabbage crunchier.
160974,33489,2005-04-11,5,"I really love coleslaw and enjoy making lots of different kinds. I'd never made one with buttermilk before, but knew I'd love the cream tang of it in the dressing. Thanks for posting!

Roxygirl in Colo."
172369,33489,2005-04-15,5,"Thanks for a great recipe, I thought my mother was going to eat the whole bowl full."
88099,33489,2005-04-16,5,"This is the only way I make cole slaw.  I will sometimes add a 1/2 tsp of celery seed, extra lemon juice and quartered cherry tomatoes, just to change it up some.  Absolutely wonderful."
158086,33489,2005-06-23,5,This was quick and tasty...the only thing I changed was I used Tarragon Vinegar and Splendra...this will be my only cole slaw recipe from now on...
37449,33489,2005-10-07,5,"Delicious! I love this kind of ""wet"" cole slaw. Sweet and tangy, just the way I like it! Thank you!"
145352,33489,2006-03-16,5,"Amazingly like KFC's!! I used half and half instead of buttermilk, but other than that no changes. "
55578,33489,2006-05-30,5,Excellent!!
176615,33489,2006-08-27,5,Very good creamy coleslaw that's not too heavy. Easy to make and a lovely side to spicy ribs. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
357358,33489,2006-12-20,5,"I did not have time to let this sit in the fridge so I just mixed it up and served it. DH said if it was that good when eaten 5 minutes after mixing, then it would be *killer* after marinating a day or two! NOTE: If you are using an full bag of Dole coleslaw mix (instead of chopping your own) and you do not like your coleslaw dry, make 15 servings worth. This worked well with the ""healthy"" mayo with canola oil. Thanks for sharing Sharlene."
131021,33489,2007-01-20,5,"I loved this. My Dh and kids are not fond of coleslaw so I scaled it down except the sauce. I didn't use the food processor for any part of it. I just chopped it by hand. I just used a whisk to stir the sauce and it worked just great. I also did not have white vinegar, used cider vinegar. I'll be making this again, maybe I'll take it to a potluck, where others can appreciate its goodness."
140132,33489,2007-01-30,4,This is a good coleslaw. I made it exactly as written and my family enjoyed it. I will be saving this for this summer when we seem to eat alot more salads. Thank you for this simple and tasty recipe....Stephanie
29782,33489,2007-02-12,5,"When I saw windy_moon's photo in the photo forum and than read all the reviews. I just had to try this recipe.  I am very happy I did too cause its the best coleslaw I have ever made, I think :)  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe. Its one I will make often."
8688,33489,2007-04-24,5,"Oh, Sharlene!  This is so good!  I was only able to allow  this to sit in the refrigerator for a couple hours before serving, but none the less, it was superb!  This is such an easy recipe and I followed it to a ""T"".  Thank you so much for sharing, Sharlene!"
285039,33489,2007-09-02,5,"I brought this to a gathering where the main dish was pulled pork and smoked brisket and it was a great side.  It was very easy, and with the exception of buttermilk the ingredients required to make the sauce are items I always have on hand.  Bye, bye bottled Marzetti coleslaw dressing -- this is was too easy and so much better that I won't be buying prepackaged dressing ever again."
135887,33489,2007-09-14,3,Tastes great but this is VERY watery.  We like our slaw to be a little creamy so we can add it to sandwiches.
187373,33489,2007-09-27,2,"Sorry, must be the odd one out, but this cole slaw ended up in the garbage disposal.  I had some leftover packaged cole slaw to use and I love KFC cole slaw, so thought I'd give this a try. Tasted nothing like KFC. Oh well, it was worth a try! Obviously many other people enjoy it so thanks for posting."
111291,33489,2007-11-11,5,"I just realized I never rated this recipe!  This is the one and only coleslaw recipe I use any more (for about the last 2 years, possibly longer!).  It is absolutely the best recipe for coleslaw ever.  I make it just as posted except I use bagged shredded cabbage and carrots...gasp...(about one large bag).  Easy and DELISH!  Thanks for sharing!"
93006,33489,2008-06-27,5,"Easy, very flavorful cole slaw.  A wonderful standard recipe to keep and use forever."
53932,33489,2008-06-15,4,"Good coleslaw!  As I knew that this much sugar would be a bit too much for me, I reduced the amount by a few teaspoons."
768828,33489,2008-11-30,5,"Just served this for a big family dinner.  Everybody loved it.  I, too used all buttermilk, in place of the milk.  Thanks for such a great recipe."
402559,33489,2009-01-11,5,"Really good, very quick and easy. Will make again, thanks!"
1122161,33489,2009-01-25,5,I will look no further for a coleslaw recipe. This is the best! It was even better the next day. Next time I will be making this a day ahead. Thanks!
637486,33489,2009-05-18,5,"This is a great slaw recipe!  I make it ""as is"" with no changes!  This is fabulous served on top of pulled pork sandwiches....yummm!"
447123,33489,2009-06-27,5,"I have made this twice now and it is just too darn good!!! Much much better than store bought and really is a nice compliment to dinner/lunch. Thanks JoMamma for a great staple to my summer cookouts!!!
Forgot to add: I just used the bagged coleslaw mix to save time. Works great!!"
126440,33489,2009-08-11,5,Great coleslaw.  I cut the recipe to serve 4 and chilled for 2 hours.  It was spot on.  DH really liked this one.
1179225,33489,2009-10-04,4,"Nice flavor. Will make again with a little more mayo. We like a creamier slaw, I also added a couple drops of Franks and a shake of celery seed. Thanks for posting!"
1133190,33489,2010-05-30,5,I don't care for coleslaw but my husband really liked this!  I don't have a large food processor so I had to use my mini one which took a while. With a large processor it would be so quick and easy though! I'll be sure to use this recipe again if I'm ever asked to bring a side dish!
653438,33489,2011-05-31,5,Wonderful!  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag and what a wonderful coleslaw.  I cut the recipe in half for DH and I but wish that I had made the whole batch.  DH finished it for a snack in the evening.  Definately will make again...thank you.
173579,33489,2011-06-09,5,Just wonderful.  Perfect in every  way.  Thanks for posting.
185926,33489,2011-09-04,5,"I'm not a coleslaw fan but I must admit this is very good.  Easy, fast and healthy.  I chopped all my vegetables by hand and it did not take that long.  I like the tang.  After reading all the reviews I was a little concerned with the amount of sugar.  But glad I stuck with the recipe, it is not too sweet.  I'm tasting it right after I made it and covering to refrigerate.  I'm sure it will get better.  Thank you."
350750,33489,2014-05-26,5,Yum!  Halved the recipe and used bagged coleslaw mix with no problems.  Thank you!
198154,33489,2015-05-25,3,"DH made this and gave it 3 stars.  He said it was good, but didn&#039;t have a whole lot of flavor to it."
1581225,33489,2017-08-11,5,I thought this tasted better than KFC. Something special about things that are home made! Will keep this recipe to make again.
175824,33489,2018-09-22,5,This is my new go to recipe. It is great!! Thanks for sharing. I'm making this again today. Yummy
54678,18914,2003-06-12,5,Fantastic! Used roasted garlic and a 3 cheese blend.
145352,5247,2007-05-30,5,worked perfectly!
173579,18914,2005-02-04,5,This was soooo tasty.  Great garlic and cheese flavor combination.
27643,18914,2003-11-03,5,"Oh, wow! We devoured this! So easy to make, and just perfect with the pasta and scallops we were serving. Thank you Sara, this is one I will make a lot!!"
55729,18914,2003-12-14,0,"I wasn't as excited about this, but I think it might have been my ""blonde"" cooking, so I'll reserve stars for another attempt. 1. I cooked this with another oven dish (at 350) so it wasn't done as quickly and this might have affected the overall flavor. 2. I used 1/2 c. butter instead of margarine, and it was unsalted. However, I think it does need a bit of that salty flavor, so I might use 1/2 garlic salt and 1/2 garlic powder next time. 3. I used ""fiesta blend"" cheese - should probably stick to the cheddar (it seemed bland). 4. I used BBQ bread, the whole loaf (12 slices). I think I needed more guidance about the spread:bread ratio (judging by the submitted picture, I should have doubled it for that much bread). 5. More garlic! But this might be back to problem #4. Sorry I couldn't rave more this time, but I will try again!"
68884,18914,2004-05-10,5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!! I have made this twice, both times splitting a loaf of French break lengthwise and putting the spread inbetween. Served with lasagna. I  made it exactly as written, except added some parsley for some color. The softened butter ever-so-slightly melts the cheese (My cheddar was finely shredded), and it makes it very spreadable. Perfect amount of garlic - and easy b/c it's stuff I always have on hand! Thank you :)"
36944,18914,2004-10-09,5,As the title says this is incredibly delicious bread spread.  It calls for ingredients that I ususally always have on hand.  I spread it on sliced french bread and cooked it exactly as stated.  It came out with a crunch (as my DH likes it) and full of flavor.  Thank you for sharing your recipe SaraFish.
229850,18914,2006-11-30,5,"This was delicious! Made this to go with Jo MaMas World Famous Sauce and we loved it. Had some left over Italian bread that I spread it over, and it was perfect, just the right amount of everything, and I didn't even have the garlic powder of all things to add. I had forgot that I was out, so I just added a little more garlic to it and was delish. Thanx for posting."
158086,18914,2007-01-21,5,very easy and good garlic bread recipe...we enjoyed it..
394077,18914,2007-01-27,4,Easy to do and tastes great.
240552,18914,2007-03-01,5,WOW!  My family loved this!  I used butter in place of margarine but everything else stayed the same.  Thank you!
8688,18914,2007-04-29,5,"This is what garlic bread is suppose to taste like!  I used 1 cup butter and increased the Parmesan  Cheese to 3/4 cup and eliminated the cheddar cheese entirely .  I baked in oven at 375 degrees until lightly toasted and served with grilled ribeye steaks and a tossed green salad : ) Delicious!  Thank you, SaraFish for this delightful recipe!"
231054,18914,2007-05-08,5,I can't believe I haven't rated this yet!!!  I've made it several times and it is so wonderful.  I'm making it again for a Mother's Day barbecue -- that's how I noticed I had not rated it.  If you want to take  your garlic bread up a few notches -- give this recipe a try.
255338,18914,2007-05-28,5,"We ordered in pizza last night, but decided to make our own garlic bread, and this recipe resulted in a tasty accompaniment to our dinner. Thank you for posting."
149363,18914,2007-07-17,5,"Yum!! Super fast and easy to put together. I had only plain white bread slices, but gave it a go anyway, and it turned out great! Thanks for a terrific time saver!"
13796,18914,2007-08-11,5,This was delicious! I bought a few baguettes and split them and spread your wonderful recipe over them and then froze them and then sealed in my vacuum sealer! I can now pop them out of the freezer right into the oven.
329638,18914,2007-08-17,5,"Cheesy, garlicky, buttery, what's not to love? Delicious!  Thanks for posting!"
248023,18914,2007-09-19,4,"We love garlic bread and this was a terrific one!!!  I used a little less than 1/2c of margarine, but followed the rest of the recipe EXCEPT I used only 1/2c of mozzarella instead of the cheddar because #1: I was out of cheddar and #2: I really didn't think cheddar would have been as yummy as mozzarella ( but that's just my opinion. If I had some cheddar I would have tried it that way and probably will next time since my BF loves cheddar cheese on his pizza and on top of spaghetti. I only made 1/2 of a loaf of French bread since I knew we would probably eat the whole thing if I made it!!! So yummy, not greasy at all ( not like the frozen brands you can buy in the stores) very garlicky, with just enough cheese to make it just a little different than regular garlic breads... thanks for a great accompaniment to Recipe #32844!  Will make it often!!!  Our waistlines will not thank you, but I do, for a really great garlic bread!"
80998,18914,2007-11-18,5,"Awesome resturant style bread.  I usually follow recipes exaclty, but had to modify because of lack of ingredients.  I used mozzerella instead of cheddder and omitted the pamesean.  The family loved it.  Thanks."
229524,18914,2007-11-25,5,My DH picked up a loaf of French bread at Panera and it was huge.  The hunt for a good Garlic spread was on.  So very happy that I found your recipe SaraFish :)  This bread spread is just wonderful.  It was easy to make and it did turn our bread into a taste sensation :)
579298,18914,2007-11-30,4,"Delicioso! I prefer this over the frozen stuff anyday! The second time I made it though, I didn't measure the garlic powder...and accidently put garlic salt instead of powder. BIG mistake. Ickey ;) This is a great and simple recipe! Thanks Sara!"
140132,18914,2007-12-30,5,very good.
176615,18914,2008-01-16,5,"Yummy! Used 1/2 c butter and some artisan sourdough bread. A nice change from regular garlic bread, and the cheddar makes this recipe a little different, and a little more versatile. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
286851,18914,2008-01-16,4,Easy and delicious spread for garlic bread. Will make again. Thanks for sharing.
98919,18914,2008-03-07,5,No wonder this recipe had a near perfect 5 stars.  Very good!!  I used mozzarella in place of the cheddar.  Whatever butter mixture I had left over I threw it in some drained green beans.  Everyone thought they were good too.  Thanks for sharing..it's a keeper!
135887,18914,2008-03-24,5,"Excellent - DS loved this one!  Made as directed.

Thank you"
242484,18914,2008-04-13,5,This is the best garlic bread I have personally ever tasted!  It went great with my baked ziti dish I made tonight!
218535,18914,2008-05-19,1,"After reading the reviews, I wasn't impressed with this at all. It's ok but not the best garlic bread spread."
195589,18914,2008-06-02,5,"Love this stuff! I use unsalted butter and add a bit of mayo and some fresh chopped parsley to the butter mixture as well.
Thanks for posting!"
74281,18914,2008-06-29,5,The title of this recipe says it all! I didn't change one thing (unusual for me!) on this recipe and everyone loved it!
131021,18914,2008-07-24,5,"We really liked this. I thought it might not spread because it was so thick, buit it was great. I used home grown garlic which was a bit milder. I would like to make it again but increase the garlic this time. Thanks for a keeper."
620763,18914,2008-08-05,5,Easy and delicious! Super fast to throw together. I used butter in place of the margarine.  You can easily swap different cheeses for this recipe to suit your taste or use whatever you have on hand.
203111,18914,2008-09-22,5,"Frankly, I anticipated that the title given this recipe was probably an exaggeration.  Believe me, folks, it's not!  This stuff is absolutely wonderful!!  I reduced the recipe to make 1/4 cup and used Smart Balance for the margarine.  Baked it in my toaster oven and am SO glad I hadn't made more because I certainly would have eaten til I burst.  Loved this!!!"
50969,18914,2008-09-29,4,"I made this on 9/28/08 as part of my dinner. I made the recipe as followed,1/2 cup margarine,1 heaping teaspoon of chopped garlic,the amount of garlic powder, and pepper was left the same.The parmesan cheese, was replaced with romano.I made this to go with Recipe#286956, and I think it went with the chili very well. Thanks for posting, and ""Keep Smiling :)"""
33159,18914,2008-10-23,5,Delicious!  Easy!  I only used the 1/2 cup of margarine & found that to be plenty.  I served this with lasagna for a family birthday dinner - it was very well received!
182624,18914,2008-10-29,4,This was great!  We'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!
222433,18914,2008-12-13,4,What else needs to be said? Good stuff! Thanks Sarafish!
188119,18914,2008-12-31,5,excellent! I added some red pepper flakes for some kick and it was really good!  thank you!
377581,18914,2009-01-09,4,This is a very nice recipe! I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. Very good. Thanks for posting!
185446,18914,2009-02-20,4,"Now I know what to do with all those French bread rolls that are in the reduced bins at grocery stores.  This is a great spread, and easy to whip up.  Also easy to reduce quantities.  Thanks, SaraFish."
369715,18914,2009-02-24,5,Very good. I used 1/2 cup of margarine and didn't add the chopped garlic. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I used sandwich bread as that is all I had. Everyone loved it and I had to make more before my meal was over. Very quick and easy to make and obviously can be used with any type of bread. I even ate this on a slice of bread without being toasted.
407007,18914,2009-03-16,5,WOW! :) This recipe is a keeper. This garlic spread is soooo good on french bread. We enjoyed ours with baked ziti!
305531,18914,2009-03-30,5,"Yummy bread! When I got ready to make this I discovered that my french bread was stale, so made it with Toscana slices instead. Very easy and good. Thanks SaraFish for a nice new keeper. Made for Cookbook Tag."
198154,18914,2009-10-21,4,The butter melted too much in the microwave.  Next time I would probably nuke it for a shorter time and check it before putting it in longer.  I used a loaf of italian bread.  I might try it on something a bit more crusty.  The bottom burnt and the top was still soft.  Even with all that going wrong it still tasted pretty darn good.   I will make this again when I am having a better day.
172369,18914,2009-10-22,5,"yum, thanks for sharing"
969481,18914,2010-03-05,5,D - licious! Absolutely no more store bought pre-maed garlic bread! I used an pre-sliced Italian round loaf with a salty crust from the bakery. Absolutely yummy!
368078,18914,2010-05-26,5,Yumm!  We spread this on thin whole-wheat pizza crust.  It was excellent!
138429,18914,2011-09-08,5,It has all been said but yes a recipe that will be in the favorites file. Excellent recipe!
103876,18914,2011-12-27,5,Made this spread for garlic bread on Christmas Day.  It had the perfect combination of flavors.  Thanks for posting!
251626,18914,2012-07-06,5,This was good. Made it as posted and everyone liked it. Thanks.
142559,18914,2012-09-29,5,Incredibly delish is right! Super simple and taaaaaaaasty! I added a little parsley to the mix and devoured.  Thanks for posting!
914720,18914,2012-12-24,5,"This was delicious.  I used 1/2 cup butter for about 3/4 of a large loaf of Italian bread.  My butter melted too much, so I mixed in the parmesan and sprinkled mozzarella on top.  Baked for about 8 minutes at 450, then turned on the broiler to brown the top a little bit more.  Served with stuffed shells.  My son said ""You did a good job with the garlic bread!""  High praise from an 11 year old.  Thanks for sharing."
145352,18914,2012-12-26,5,This was awesome. Everyone loved it.
37449,18914,2013-05-10,5,I scaled down the recipe and enjoyed on whole grain toast. Thanks!
88099,18914,2013-09-02,5,Excellent.  The combination of cheese and garlic were spot on.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for I Recommend tag game.
8629,18914,2014-12-26,5,"Updating my previous review -&lt;br/&gt;    5-stars instead of my original 2 stars.  I think it must be the quality of the ingredients I used this time compared to the first time I made this. I started with a loaf of fresh, homemade Italian bread.  I used unsalted butter instead of margarine.  The cheddar cheese I used was labelled &#039;Seriously Sharp White Cheddar&#039;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With nearly 200 5 star ratings, I feel weird giving it 2 stars but for me it was just fair.  The cheddar cheese seemed out of place on garlic bread. I couldn&#039;t really taste the garlic or the parmesan cheese. I did like how baking, rather than broiling, the bread resulted in a crispy top and bottom."
128473,18914,2016-07-11,5,"Wow, was this ever good. We really loved this simple recipe, it was so quick and easy to make with terrific results. Best of all it uses ingredients that are always found in my pantry and fridge. Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy often. Made for What's on the Menu tag game."
39835,45940,2003-02-23,5,We loved this recipe! My husband said these were the best porkchops we had in five years--tender and juicy and the gravy was great over mashed potatoes. Thanks Buttercup for the perfect way to make porkchops--so easy with fail-proof directions.
8688,45940,2003-03-26,5,"Wonderful, buttercup!  This recipe is a cinch to pop into the crockpot and is ready in only a couple hours!  I used 4 -1"" boneless pork loin chops and served this with Bergy's Penne with Broccoli and Garlic recipe #11647.  We all enjoyed our meal so much!  Thank you, buttercup!!"
101034,45940,2003-10-20,4,"My husband loved this. I liked it, but I'm not a big pork chop lover, but it was very good. I'll make it again, this time with lots of mashed potatoes for the delicious gravy. Thanks!!!"
44383,45940,2003-11-12,4,"I made this yesterday for dinner exactly as the recipe states. Although the pork chops turned out wonderfully tender and tasty (used butterfly boneless), the gravy was thick and gloopy as previously stated and was a teeny bit bland as also previously stated.  Hubby said gravy could have been a little bit more gravy-ish.  Anyway I'm keeping this one, will do again with some added seasonings and tweekings. Overall, a pretty good recipe though because this is the best slow cooked pork chop I've had to date. "
59473,45940,2004-04-11,4,This was so good and easy to prepare. I used breaded pork cutlets. They turned out so tender and the gravy was delicious. I served it with mashed potatoes. I will make this again. Thanks
169969,45940,2004-12-23,5,"I am going to add to your reviews.... These were so tender and had an incredible flavor! I could not find condensed Chicken broth... so I used regular chicken broth and a bit of condensed cream of chicken. They were FABULOUS! I served them with Apple Sauce (#70097), Macaroni and Cheese (#52799), Buttery Yeast Rolls (#40983)and broccoli. Everyone loved them! My friend that I invited over could not believe that I slaved away all day - she would not believe me that I just popped them in the slow cooker! Thank you!"
146047,45940,2004-12-24,5,"Great stuff! After 2 hours baking in the oven in a covered cast iron skillet, these were tender and tasty, and went well with the pasta and broccoli I served on the side. Seeing that other reviewers thought this a tad bland, I added 1 T prepared mustard and about 1/2 tsp dried rosemary to the cooking liquid.  I had just under a pound of pork, and found that 1/4 c flour was sufficient. After the chops were done, I added a cup of water to the pan drippings to create a gravy that I then thickened with a bit of cornstarch. Delicous meal-- thanks for posting!"
168462,45940,2005-03-02,5,Very easy to prepare. Everyone loved these but next time I might try using a low sodium broth. Thanks for the recipe.
174991,45940,2006-02-09,5,These chops and gravy are wonderful.  The meat is very moist and the gravy is plentiful.  I cut the recipe in half and served this over mashed potatoes.  I had 1 leftover so I shredded it and served it over bread for a quick lunch. Next time I'll try this with chicken breast.  Thanks for sharing.
229524,45940,2007-02-24,5,No wonder this recipe has so many great reviews.  My husband made it and I must say these were the most tender pork chops I have every eaten.  The gravy was super.  Loved the taste of this dish and will be making often.  We did add fresh garlic and I plan on adding fresh mushrooms next time.  Thanks buttercup0009 for such a wonderful recipe.
32772,45940,2007-07-04,5,"I have to say I was a little skeptical about how this recipe would turn out. I thought there is no way that the gravy would thicken and I was worried that the flour coating would cook well and stay soft.  Boy, I was proven wrong. This recipe went into my top 20 crock pot recipes.  The flavor was fabulous.  I read one review about putting in beef broth to make it darker but I felt the color was consistent to what pork chops and gravy would look like not cooked in a crock pot. I suggest maybe adding a gravy enhancer like Kitchen Boutique."
227607,45940,2007-07-08,5,"This was wonderful.  Everyone loved it(even my picky 10 yr old).  The only thing I would do is add more garlic, salt, and some pepper.  We added it at the table but I am sure it would be better cooked into it.  I only cooked it for about 2 1/2 hours and the pork chops were not falling apart but very tender(just how we like them-I don't like the texture of pork chops cooked to almost nothing).  Much cheaper and better than the mushroom soup one I usually make."
140132,45940,2007-08-23,5,"Comfort food at its best.  We really liked this.  I served it with mashed potatoes and buttered peas.  I will be using this recipe again as it was so simple.
THank you.......Stephanie"
369715,45940,2007-12-17,5,My family really enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly as written other then I used pam in my pan and not oil to cook the chops. This was really good and easy to make. It made a GREAT gravy. I made this with stuffing and everyone enjoyed the gravy over the stuffing. Will be making this again! Thanks buttercup.
98919,45940,2008-02-01,4,Taste was very good and liked the change from the usual way I make crockpot pork chops. Thanks for sharing.
95743,45940,2008-02-03,5,Played with the seasoning a bit but loved the cooking technique.
131021,45940,2008-07-24,5,This was so good. I used boneless pork chops and browned them with just a couple teaspoons of oil. It was so good we didn't leave any leftovers. I just spent an hour looking for this recipe because I forgot to review it when I made it a few weeks ago. I want to try it with pork loin that is on sale right now. I think I could brown the pork loin and then cook it on low for a few hours like I did with the chops.
844554,45940,2008-10-17,5,"I can see why everyone loved this recipe -- me included! I added wine and mushrooms and sage and garlic powder, as per other reviewers. It was tender and tasty. Served it with brown rice and Recipe #19710. Very good."
37779,45940,2009-10-04,4,"My family enjoyed this simple, homey, very comforting meal. My chops were more like 1/2 inch thick and fell apart as I was getting them out of the crockpot. I think thicker chops would hold together better. The gravy was yummy over rice. Thanks for posting."
355637,45940,2009-04-18,5,"I love tender pork chops, and this recipe delivers! Yum!"
632249,45940,2010-01-31,5,"The best pork chops I have ever made in the crock pot!  They were so tender and delicious. I followed the recipe but decided to slice up some onions and fried them with the chops then put them in the bottom of the crock pot. After the chops cooked for a few hours, I added a few shakes of poultry seasoning to give the gravy a bit more flavour. It was just excellent and I am putting this in my favourites book for the crock pot. Thx buttercup!"
218535,45940,2010-06-07,4,This is very good. Definitely will make again.
789516,45940,2010-10-04,5,"These chops were good, but it's the gravy that was amazing.  I used my own homemade stock so I did need to add more salt than was asked for.  Next time I won't cook for longer than 2 hours.  Thanks!"
937635,45940,2011-02-10,5,"Oh my goodness so good and easy and uses stuff I always have on hand! I cooked them on high for 3 hours and then on low for 30 minutes or so. These were the most tender pork chops I've ever eaten! I used 2 pork chops and didn't season them beforehand and they were perfectly seasoned with the flour mix. I had 3/4 box full of veggie stock, so I used 1 1/2 cups of that and added a tsp of Better than Boullion. Served over mashed sweet potatoes and a southern green bean dish my hubby made. I will definitely make this again and again, thanks buttercup!"
173579,45940,2012-03-21,5,This was a very tasty meal.  Quick and easy to make.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for posting.
13796,45940,2013-10-31,5,"Wow.. I&#039;m not much for crock pot recipes...   but this turned out great.  My mom really liked it, too. I added thinly sliced onions and put a couple of chunks of carrot and celery into the crock. I can already think of using this same concept with the broth and seasoned flour mixture and doing chicken, too. ... with a little poultry seasoning."
149363,76616,2005-05-11,5,"Awesome taco seasoning. I used this to make Kitten's Taco Salad for a Crowd! #120444 and it was just fantastic.
I will make a huge batch next time and keep it in my cupboard.
No need to ever buy taco seasoning again!
Thanks for yet another great recipe Kitten!"
124249,76616,2005-05-18,5,"We liked the flavor this mix added to the meat. I used it with your Taco salad recipe. Very good.

Thanks KITTENCAL

Bullwinkle."
88099,76616,2006-06-17,5,"This was without a doubt the best taco seasoning I have ever tasted.  I tripled the recipe for 3 pounds of double ground briskett for tacos tonight and didn't see Kitz warning about the salt reduction, but it still turned out great.  I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce with the seasoning and a little water and simmered it for about 45 minutes. Yummy good.  Thanks Kitz for another wonderful recipe.  Dave loved them"
222564,76616,2006-07-01,5,"This is just as good, if not better, than the little seasoning packages you get from stores. I was using this for Kittencals Amazing  Layered Bean Taco Dip which was great! Using this mix gets cheaper on a long run and it's always nice to know what you're eating. Will be used on a regular basis."
230557,76616,2006-10-26,3,"I made this mix, doubled except for the salt, to use in another Zarr recipe, and I used cayenne pepper.  It was too hot for my children, and my husband and I were only able to eat a little before our mouths became just too hot to finish.  We normally enjoy some heat but this really overwhelmed the other flavors and I was disappointed to have to fix something different for the kids.  Will try again with much less cayenne & half the salt - and at least I know now how much (or little) heat my family can handle in a recipe :)"
133174,76616,2007-07-27,5,I don't know how this would work as taco seasoning but it was excellent on the chicken for recipe #224868.
248023,76616,2007-09-23,4,"Terrific taco mix!  I used it in Recipe #27735... I did cut back on the chili powder as mine seems to be a very potent batch and on the recommendations of other reviewers who said it overpowered the other spices...  I ended up using about 2 tsp instead of 1 1/2 Tbs...  I also used the tsp of seasoning salt and I think I will cut that back next time, as we found it a tad salty for our tastes since I ended up adding a tsp of the tomato powder also...  I will add more cayenne next time, since I like it spicy... a great and easy mix to throw together and keep when you buy all your fresh spices at the market.  I buy new spices every 6 months at my local farmer's market and always make a big batch of this mix to keep and to give away... Thanks Kitten for another great one!!!"
400420,76616,2007-10-06,5,"Very good! I increased the recipe by 1/2 for 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef. I added about a tablespoon of flour and mixed it in with about 3/4 cup water. I used the meat in recipe #74301 and they turned out great. I think the flavor was even better when I reheated the leftovers the next day. I'm still searching around for the perfect seasoning that suits the taste of our family, but this has lots of flavor and is definitely a good one! Thank you!
*UPDATE* I doubled this and used it on a 4 lb pork shoulder in the crock pot.  Turned out SO GOOD!  Served as carnitas tacos.  I intended to freeze 1/2 but family has been eating it up and it's almost gone!  Thanks again!"
8629,76616,2007-10-07,5,I made this as directed and then used it with Kittencal's Taco Salad for a Crowd recipe.  It was great!
407007,76616,2008-01-14,5,"Perfect blend of flavor! I think this tasted better than the store-bought kind, because I was able to make it less salty. I omitted the onion powder but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee. I put it right into some ground turkey that I was browning. After the turkey was brown, I lowered the heat and let it simmer for 5 minutes to absorb all the flavor. That's when DH started asking what was for dinner and what smelled so good. :) Then we put the meat onto nachos and the flavor was perfection! Thanks for a keeper."
529278,76616,2008-08-01,4,"Used the highest amounts listed.  Used table salt, because I couldn't find our season salt.  I needed this recipe for Mexican Shepherd's Pie Recipe #133091.  My husband said it tasted similar to Taco Bell."
131021,76616,2008-10-29,5,"We really liked this and will be using it from now on, no more of that expensive store bought stuff."
4470,76616,2008-12-07,5,"Easy to mix great tasting Taco seaoning/All the ingredients are always on my spice shelf!
Made for the KITTENCAL COOKATON - My thoughts are there with you!"
26512,76616,2009-01-04,5,Very nice. I mixed this up to use on chicken tacos. I used smoked paprika and added chipotle powder as well. Great alternative to the package mixes.
637486,76616,2009-04-28,5,"This was just wonderful!  I stumbled upon this recipe when I realized I didn't have any taco mix in my cupboard to make for dinner tonight.  I knew I could find something on RecipeZaar, and this is definitely a winner!!  I followed the recipe as stated and I thought it tasted very similar to what I would get at the store.  I will add more cayenne pepper next time for more heat, and I will be making a large batch to keep around.  Thanks again!"
226863,76616,2009-05-11,5,I made this to use in some of ZWT5's Mexican recipes....its great tasting and lots cheaper than buying the packaged mixes.  I'm sure I'll enjoy this recipe many times in the future!  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT5!
305531,76616,2009-05-23,5,This is some great stuff! I made this as directed except that I used a hot Mexican chili powder and a Mexican oregano. I added this to some ground beef that I made into tacos. Thanks Kitten for another great recipe. Made for ZWT5 2009.
142559,76616,2009-07-29,5,Very easy and very good! Better than the stuff in the package! I used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika and it added a beautiful flavor to this! Thanks again for another winner!
879716,76616,2009-08-05,5,"Kitten, you never steer me wrong.  I've been using this for a while now and it's great stuff.  Didn't realize I hadn't rated this until I needed to make another batch.... think I'll make a much bigger batch this time though.  Thanks for another goodie."
1365025,76616,2009-10-11,5,Loved it even though it was a little to hot for me. I only used 1 Tb of chili powder and no cayenne pepper but it was still kinda spicy hot for my taste. Next time I make it and I will make it from now on I'll use only 1/2 tsp. of black pepper. This is much better than store bought taco seasoning.
579298,76616,2009-11-11,5,Made this recipe for Recipe #120444 - Absolutely perfect!
353131,76616,2009-12-19,5,I couldn't tell you how many times I have made this recipe! We love it! I did as you suggested and made as gifts for my sisters for Christmas stocking gifts!! Can't wait to get their reviews!! Great rcipe!!!!
111291,76616,2010-02-23,5,"another 5 star recipe from kittencal!  i made this just as posted.  i added the mix to 1 lb extra lean ground beef while i was browning it.  there wasn't any need to add cornstarch since there was minimal fat.  i didn't have the dried granulated tomato powder, and because i thought the tomato flavor would taste great, i added 2 Tbs. of tomato paste and 2 Tbs. water.  PERFECT taste and thickness!  since i try to make most of my foods from scratch and avoid packaged items, this will be my ""go to"" recipe from here on!  thanks!!"
198154,76616,2010-05-01,4,We had everything for taco except a seasoning packet. So you saved the night. We used  the min. amount of the spices and left out the optional items.  DD doesn't lik anything spicy but DH does so he had his bottle of hot sauce on hand to add to his.  We used with Morning Star veggie grounds and added just enough water to keep it from getting dried out.  It proved just right for the entire family.  Thanks Kittencal!
844554,76616,2011-09-13,5,Just what I was looking for. The store packets are SO salty to me so this was perfect. I can adjust my own salt and it still tastes like taco seasoning. Thanks for this one!!!
2041603,76616,2011-10-25,5,We made this with ground turkey for tacos and I cannot tell you how much I loved it. I plan on making a big batch of these to keep on hand. I even put some in my tuna for today's lunch and I can't wait to try it! This recipe is perfect.
55729,76616,2011-11-11,4,"I made this to use in Recipe #150046, a double batch. I used the larger amounts of garlic powder and cumin, and no cayenne. It certainly looked like the packaged stuff, and I always have all of these ingredients on hand. It might not necessarily be less expensive, but it is certainly healthier (lacking all of the unpronounceable chemicals). I will certainly use this often. (November 10, 2011) Edit: After using this in the recipe, I think 3 tsp. of cumin per batch is too much. It was harsh, or bitter, or some word that escapes me at the moment. Next time I will only use 2 tsp. And I will also try to curb my addiction to the word ""certainly."" LOL"
653438,76616,2011-12-07,5,Another wonderful recipe by Kittencal!  Used this recipe to make recipe#76043#76043 and DH said to use this recipe in ALL my Mexican cooking.  I did add about 1 1/2Tbls. of dried granulated tomato powder as you recommended.  Definately going into my Favorites of 2011.  Thank you for posting.
789516,76616,2012-01-18,5,This was great!  Used about 2 1/2 tbsp for 1 lb ground beef with 1/4 cup of water.
1179225,76616,2012-08-21,5,"Perfect! Extra hot chili powder was all I had on hand, so it was kick'n, but tasty just the same. Thanks so much!"
251626,76616,2013-05-19,5,This is great. Packaged stuff is expensive and this is way more convenient.
540346,76616,2015-07-12,5,"I have used this twice now in taco soup and it is great.  I made the soup for a friend and she told me it was better than hers and that I must do something different.  I told her I made my own seasoning mix and didn&#039;t use a packet.  I also made tacos with this, too, and they were delicious but a little too salty.  Next time I plan to cut the seasoning salt down to 1/2 tsp.  I have now started using smoked paprika in this mix and it adds a delicious flavor.  I also add a pinch of ground chipotle pepper instead of cayenne pepper."
265954,76616,2015-08-25,4,"Good recipe. You can&#039;t go wrong with Kittencal&#039;s recipes. She&#039;s been a part of our kitchen for some time now, even though I don&#039;t know her. :-)  I made this recipe exactly as directed, with 1/2 tsp. of white salt. However, I found it needed a little extra salt--1/4 tsp. extra--for our taste. I also added a 28 oz. of tomato sauce to the meat. The taco seasoning was beautiful. Keep in mind that if the seasoning comes out too spicy for your taste, you can balance out the heat with some added sugar. Thank you for posting."
35526,26306,2003-03-03,5,"I cut recipe way down to serve 4 and it worked great.  I was afraid it would be gummy but it was not.  I used store brand corn and no one was the wiser, LOL!"
32058,26306,2003-03-21,5,This is a great recipe!  TY
37036,26306,2004-06-14,5,"Great corn recipe!  My sister and I used to beg my mom to buy the Green Giant Niblets Corn in Butter Sauce, and she didn't always buy it because it was expensive when you are on a tight budget!  This corn tasted just like I remember!  Delicious!!!  I plan on making it often now that I found the recipe!  "
138429,26306,2005-05-28,5,"Wonderful!!!. I served this to guests and they loved it. I did half the recipe.  My friend asked where I had purchased the corn in the sauce. I did add a couple of green onions ..... the green color looked nice with the corn.   This recipe is a keeper in this household for sure.
 Thank you for this great recipe "
36944,26306,2005-09-29,5,Fast and easy way to make a delicious and simple corn dish.  The directions are well written and easy to follow.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Karen=^..^=!
124249,26306,2005-11-13,5,"I haven't tried Green Giant Butter Corn before but this was buttery good. We liked it.
Will make again. I made half of the recipe.

Thanks Karen=^..^=

Bullwinkle "
189616,26306,2005-12-19,5,"Excellant, prepared as written only halving the recipe
Thank You Karen=^..^="
50969,26306,2005-12-20,4,"i made half of this recipe for our dinner tonight,and it was really very good.the amounts of sugar and salt provided the perfect balance of taste.this will be made again.thank you for posting."
55729,26306,2006-01-23,5,"Like the ""real thing"" - only better! I didn't get that slight chemical taste with this. It is not too hard to do, either."
176615,26306,2006-02-19,5,"Easy and really good! Everyone enjoyed the dish and with frozen corn it goes together in a flash. I don't buy the Green Giant veggies in sauce, it's expensive and the sauce tastes wierd to me, but I'll definitely make this again. Thanks, Karen, for posting!"
101823,26306,2006-03-18,5,I downsized the recipe to serve as a side with our St. Patty's Day corned beef and cabbage (and spinach mashed potatoes).  The slight sweetness of the sauce is a nice complement to the tangy richness of the rest of the meal.  We will be trying this as a side to many meals.
119466,26306,2006-04-17,5,"I really can't rate this as a ""copycat"" recipe, since I don't think I've ever had the original brand-name version, but I included it as one of the sides for Easter dinner and everyone really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
52125,26306,2006-06-18,5,"I never really had Green Giant Niblets Corn so I don't really know what its suppose to taste like. I do know that I really enjoyed this recipe a whole bunch, it tasted really good! Thanks for posting a great recipe Karen=^..^=...."
64203,26306,2006-09-03,5,"This copy cat recipe is even better than the original, in my opinion. Great flavor and such an easy way to dress up frozen corn. I halved the recipe, using only one bag of corn and added some black pepper at the finish. Delicious!"
285039,26306,2006-10-05,5,"Since my frozen corn was still frozen, it turned out a bit runny.  I had to cook it longer to get it to a thicker consistency. But it was yummy and loved by adults and kids alike!"
60989,26306,2006-11-27,4,"A good, quick and easy sidedish to our Thanksgiving meal. Thanks!"
158086,26306,2006-11-29,5,I made this for Thanksgiving dinner using Splenda...turned out perfect...we all loved it....
47907,26306,2006-12-02,5,I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I made as posted and it really does taste like GG niblets in butter sauce.  It was very easy to make and I will be making it again and again.  Thanks for posting!
51011,26306,2006-12-18,4,Made this tonight to go with dinner- it was so easy!  Who would have thought that was what I was paying so much money for.  Thanks for sharing!
145352,26306,2007-01-01,5,Fantastic!!!! My corn-loving boys were raving!!!
298447,26306,2007-01-04,5,"The Jolly Green Giant called...said he wanted his recipe back...you're hurting his business!  It is very apparent that you don't need another glowing review, but I simply couldn't resist telling you just how much we love your recipe.  What a great tasting, easy, quick and inexpensive way to put some yummy veggies on the dinner table that everyone will enjoy.  Thanks!"
133174,26306,2007-01-28,5,I can definately understand all the wonderful ratings.  This is awesome.  Everyone thought it was the real thing.  Divided the recipe in half without a problem.
160974,26306,2007-02-07,5,"This was a nice change and similar to the Green Giant Corn in Butter Sauce. My family usually likes their corn with just a pinch of butter and pepper, so I will probably do that again in the future. I'll save this for company, when corn needs a bit of dressing up. Update: I have made this several times since and it is worth it!

Roxygirl in colo."
60992,26306,2007-02-27,4,This was quite good. I halved the recipe as there was only 3 of us. I used only 1/4 t. sugar and should have halved the salt to 1/2t. as it was just too salty. And I like salty corn. I am sure I will make this again following the changes I have stated above. It was really a nice unique dish.
58836,26306,2007-03-11,5,Made today for lunch and it turned out really good.  I'm sure I will make again.  Thanks!
461834,26306,2007-03-27,5,"This was very good, family really enjoyed the corn.  I have never tasted the Green Giant Corn in Butter Sauce, so can't say if it tastes like it, but can say it is very good.  Thanks for posting a easy and tasty corn recipe."
140132,26306,2007-04-12,5,Great side dish.  I made this in the crock pot and it worked wonderful. I served this with our Easter dinner and we loved it.  Thank you for a yummy recipe....Stephanie
227607,26306,2007-05-02,4,"My daughter Kaylee is rating this since it was her dinner choice. ""This is very buttery and really good"""
74281,26306,2007-05-14,4,"This was so easy and really good although next time I would likely cut down on the salt a bit. Even though I LOVE salt, the salt in this recipe seemed to overpower the sweet. To compensate I added another teaspoon of sugar and it was really delicious and a LOT cheaper than buying the Green Giant version. Another caution, although Karen says it makes 10-12 servings, my brain didn't notice that and it DOES make 10-12 servings!! Thanks for the great recipe Karen! We will have this often in our house."
248023,26306,2007-08-11,5,"I cut this recipe in half since there is only two of us...  I have always loved Green Giant corn but the price is just ridiculous, so this is the best recipe for buttery sweet corn.  There is no more work in preparing corn this delicious way than you would have the tradional way.  I have found it works really well with canned corn also, but if I do use the canned I save the liquid and use that instead of the water and cut out the salt completely.  A great, easy side dish for any dinner!  Thanks!!!"
7108,26306,2007-08-12,5,"Another 5 star review!  I cut the recipe in half as well.  Next time, I would cut back on the salt just a smidge.  Really tasty and really easy.  Thanks for posting!"
529278,26306,2007-08-14,3,"This was okay, but not what I expected.  Didn't taste like the store bought stuff, in my opinion.  Also too runny."
184723,26306,2007-09-04,5,This is really a very good way to serve corn to kids on tuna casserole night like I just did!  I halved the recipe and they just gobbled it up.  Now upon reviewing this I realize I forgot to add the salt and even without it (and I like salt on everything) it was good.  Thanks a lot!
37868,26306,2007-10-03,5,"Lets clear the board with 5 Stars.
It sure is a ringer for GG. My Brother and I think this is great.
I did not change nothing..will not change. Thank You so very much. Hugs"
142559,26306,2007-11-22,5,"Excellent!  Served this for Thanksgiving this year, was a BIG hit! I did not have frozen corn, but used 3 cans of corn, and drained the liquid from them. Worked perfectly! Thanks for posting!"
222433,26306,2007-12-27,4,Great recipe. Will make often. Thanks Karen!
305531,26306,2008-03-05,5,Very simple and delicious side dish. Tastes just like those expensive boxes. Thanks for sharing. Made for I Recommend tag.
242484,26306,2008-04-07,4,"Very good, buttery & sweet!"
218535,26306,2008-04-29,5,Delicious and easy. I prepared only 1/2 the recipe for our family of 5.
140806,26306,2008-07-11,3,Just too much butter for my taste.
76951,26306,2008-12-21,5,"I can't believe I haven't rated this.  I looked it up today for a pre-Christmas dinner and discovered the error of my ways!  I've made this several times, always with great success.  I was glad to see that it can be made with Splenda (thanks Internetnut)."
1072593,26306,2009-05-02,5,"Completely besides the economic factor of this saucy little recipe, the end results are fantastic...170+ reviews and counting upward!!! 5*  Made for Tast of Yellow LiveStrong Event."
1365025,26306,2010-03-19,4,This was good. I used can corn as that's all I had on hand. Easy to make. I even got up some time during the night and had the munchies so I ate some of this right out of the frig. It was even good cold.
203325,26306,2013-12-21,5,This is a quick and easy side dish.  Not just ordinary corn!
126440,26306,2014-01-13,4,Tried to cut this down for two but didn&#039;t come out right.  Too salty and never did thicken up.  Probably better just to make the entire recipe.
128473,26306,2015-01-09,5,"The corn was so delicious prepared this way.  It was sweet and tender surrounded in a lovely, silky butter sauce.  It was perfect served over saffron rice.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will make again.  Made for What&#039;s on the Menu Tag Game 2015."
198154,26306,2018-08-08,4,"Made this as a side for dinner tonight. I reduced the salt, as we have a family member on a low sodium diet. Also sweetened with stevia. I served it with chicken and stuffing. Everyone enjoyed it."
89831,110683,2005-04-10,5,"I made a double recipe of these wonderful waffles today for brunch! My family enjoyed these so much, they have a wonderful taste and a light texture, definately a five star recipe. I made mine using half and half cream. I served them with real Canadian maple syrup....DELICIOUS! thanks Rox for another winning recipe, we loved the waffles!...Kittencal:)"
124249,110683,2005-04-22,5,"These were nice waffles. Since there are just 2 of us I kept the batter in the fridge for two more days and the waffles were still good each time. We tried all the variations you listed and we especially liked the toasted nut and banana combo.

Thanks Roxygirl in Colorado.

Bullwinkle"
146047,110683,2005-05-08,5,"These are really great waffles, Roxygirl! We enjoyed them with syrup this morning. I used whole wheat pastry, bread, and soy flours for a bit of nutritional variety, but otherwise followed the recipe. The batter was very thick, which may be because I mismeasured. The end result was delicious. Thanks for posting."
280271,110683,2006-01-28,4,I thought these were on the heavy side. (too much oil) The recipe that came with my waffle maker is basically the same except uses a lot less oil and doesn't use the vanilla and maple flavorings. I did like the touch of flavor addition and I will include those next time I make my normal waffles.
176615,110683,2006-12-18,5,Very yummy and loved by all. I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
373817,110683,2007-03-02,5,"These are very good! I halved the recipe, and instead of the maple extract (didn't have any) I just doubled the vanilla. It was really good! I'll make these again!"
132383,110683,2007-04-07,5,I really liked this recipe...I didn't have maple extract so we put a little more vanilla and four ounces of melted butter.  We made half the recipe and it was perfect for two Belgian Waffles. Thanks for posting!
280166,110683,2007-04-29,4,These were very easy and tasty!  I substituted 1/4 cup whole wheat flour our 1/4 cup all purpose and just now I realized I forgot the oil and they were still very good and very crisp!  Thanks for posting!
316717,110683,2007-10-30,3,my hubby and i agreed that this w/ out syrup tasted like the bread at church during communion. we much prefer waffles w/ a hint of sweetness to it. kids enjoyed it very much.
324621,110683,2008-02-18,5,These were really good! The best waffles I've been able to make in my waffle maker yet. Nice flavor and they cooked up beautifully in 2 minutes. I doubled the recipe and was done making them in about 20 minutes. We'll be making these again I'm sure!
386849,110683,2009-02-14,4,"Very, very good.  Thanks!"
173579,110683,2009-08-10,5,These are fantastic!  They are the best  waffles we have ever tasted.  Loved the maple and vanilla combination.  We will be using this recipe from now on.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe.
140132,110683,2009-08-13,4,"I made these last night for dinner.  We really liked them , I especially liked the maple extract in these.  I will make again as they are sooooo easy to put together.  Thank you for sharing."
383346,110683,2009-12-28,5,It was my first time doing waffles and I'm glad to have chosen this recipe.  I used 2% fat milk.  And I didn't use the maple extract.  Very yummy.  Thanks :)
371738,110683,2010-01-20,4,"Very tasty waffle recipe.  My first attempt at making them homemade, so I appreciate your post.  Thanks."
52262,110683,2010-02-09,5,Very good and easy waffles.  I doubled the recipe and got about 17 waffles.  I used regular evaporated milk for half of the milk amount with the other half being skim milk.  I added an extra tsp. of vanilla and didn't use any maple extract.
485151,110683,2010-07-19,4,"These were the first waffles I've ever tried & they turned out great! I made them on my new George Foreman grill that came with waffle plates and they cooked up wonderfully. They didn't stick (I don't know if that had to do with the recipe or the non-stick spray I used), the outside got nice & golden brown and just a tad crusty while the inside was oh so soft-  just like we like them!  The kids loved them and hubby even ate 2 (which was a surprise.) <br/><br/>I used what I had on hand for the recipe- which was 2% milk & only vanilla extract. (I'm definitely going to pick some up for next time b/c I have a feeling it'll make it a five-star recipe then!) I also added a few dashes of cinnamon to the dry ingrediants. The batter was really lumpy which worried me, but after I cooked them it didn't make a difference. This recipe made 6 big waffles on my George Foreman G5 grill.<br/><br/>I think next time I'm going to try and make it healthier by using some wheat flour & possibly wheat germ or flax seed. I also want to try and find a way to cut back on the oil by substituting some of it with something healthier. No matter if I make them as recipe stated or slightly healthier- I will be making these again."
232480,110683,2011-12-14,3,"I LOVE that these waffles don't have you beating egg whites separately and that the batter can be mixed up and ready in under 5 minutes.  That said, we didn't find these very tender at all, and rather flavorless for our tastes.  The flavor can be fixed easily enough, but I'm not sure I can do much about the tenderness...I think I'll keep looking for a good, quick waffle recipe."
189475,110683,2012-02-24,5,"Delicious!! I never really noticed how badly boxed waffle mix was until I made this recipe. I made waffles with the boxed mix and other ones with this recipe. After trying both, I threw the ones made from th boxed mix in the trash. Another thing I love about it is that its very liquidy so you don't need to use a spatula to spread it in the waffle iron. You can just pour it."
540346,110683,2012-03-22,5,Very good and easy to make.  I liked the addition of the maple extract to the batter.  This made enough for our family of 6 and we had two waffles left over.
400420,110683,2012-06-17,4,"We thought these were really good.  Batter had a good flavor (I used both vanilla and maple extract) and very easy to mix up. They were super tender inside, but we would have liked them a little crispier.  I left them in the iron for a long time and they just didn't crisp up as much as I wanted, but still very tasty.  I subbed 1/4 cup of Flax Meal for flour, so maybe that is what caused this.  My DH and DD really liked them for Father's Day breakfast.  Thank you for posting!"
839492,110683,2015-02-14,5,"Left out the vanilla &amp; maple. Excellent, thanks for sharing!"
187373,110683,2013-11-24,5,"Light and fluffy and easy, quick to make. Have the rest in the freezer. Thanks for posting!"
350750,110683,2014-03-16,5,These waffles are frequently made in our house.  It is easy and they are tasty.  Thank you!
482376,110683,2015-04-11,5,"Excellent, fast and easy! Easily halved, which made 3 large waffles. Thank you!"
265954,110683,2015-08-14,4,"This is a great and versatile recipe. You can easily add blueberries, chocolate chips, cinnamon, etc. I doubled the recipe because cleaning the waffle iron is such a chore, and then I added a tablespoon of cinnamon and three teaspoons of vanilla. That yielded 14 fluffy waffles and I think the added cinnamon and extra vanilla gave the waffles an added flavor that we would have missed if omitted. To make the waffles extra fluffy, I poured the batter into the waffle iron and left the lid up for a minute so the bottom portion of the waffle could rise. I then closed the lid and let the entire waffle cook through. My family and I ate five of the waffles for breakfast and I froze the rest. I will be thawing the waffles and popping them into the toaster oven when the kids, my hubby, or I want waffles for breakfast!"
4470,59473,2010-05-09,5,"This was such a treat, I couldn't find any Harissa and didn't have the ingredients to mix my own so I subbed Sambal Oelek.  Harissa is based on Peri Peri and sambal oelek crushed chillies, Great flavored   burger Thanks Pets' for posted a burger that will remain a favorite"
38643,5247,2002-10-23,5,Used this recipe to make Inez's Beer bread.  Turned out great. Thanks!
60992,5247,2003-03-19,5,"Thank you for the ""life"" saving recipe. I wanted to make a from scratch cake and was out of self rising flour. The cake turned out beautifully thanks in part to this recipe!"
91392,5247,2003-09-02,5,Just used this to make the Jaffa cake.  Why buy it???!!! Thanks!
32772,5247,2003-09-07,5,Thanks for such a great recipe. No need to buy self-rising flour when you don't use it that often. Thanks again!
37868,5247,2003-09-26,4,Thank You for the recipe..You saved my life this am..
18391,5247,2004-10-01,5,This worked wonderfully thanks!
104295,5247,2004-12-06,5,Worked just fine.  Thanks so much!!  I use whole wheat pastry flour instead of white and add the rest and it works fine.
176615,5247,2005-10-01,5,I used this for Cheddar and Chile Beer Bread #110878 after deciding my self-rising flour was too old and throwing it out. I'll never buy it again! Thanks!
52125,5247,2006-02-25,5,"I was in need of some self-rising flour in a hurry, and this came in real handy. Thanks HELEN PEAGRAM...."
37449,5247,2006-10-05,5,"I don't buy self rising flour, but the recipe I was using called for it, so to Zaar for a great fix! Thank you!"
350750,5247,2007-04-12,4,I have no need to have self-rising flour on hand so this recipe comes in handy when i do need it.
119466,5247,2007-06-23,5,"This is what I always use when recipes call for self-rising flour. I keep several different types of flour on hand for baking bread and have never seen a point in buying yet another different one--I wouldn't use it often anyway, and it's just too easy to simply add the baking powder and salt. Thanks for posting this practical substitute."
248023,5247,2007-09-16,4,"I use this recipe anytime I need self rising flour.  The only thing I do differently is to use 1 cup  MINUS 2 tsp of flour and then add the baking powder and salt to make up the full cup.  I don't see the point in keeping a bag of self rising flour in the pantry when it is sooooo easy to make your own... and plus, I don't use it as often as my AP flour and this way, it is always fresh!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!"
37305,5247,2007-10-04,5,Worked beautifully with a cake recipe I needed to make.  Rose perfectly and the texture is fabulous.  Thanks!
37036,5247,2007-12-02,5,"Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  I don't keep self-rising flour on hand in my pantry because I don't use it often.  However, I came across a recipe that called for it.  Instead of going to the store, I tried this recipe and it worked great.  Thanks!"
146486,5247,2008-04-21,5,"Wow this really does work!  Every now and then I need self rising flour for a recipe, but I've always hated to buy a whole bag and have it go to waste.  I'll never have to do that again!!  Thanks for this neat tip!"
357358,5247,2008-11-29,5,You saved me a run to the store. Never again will I need to keep self-rising flour on hand since it is so easy to mix up what I need when I need it. Thanks for posting.
844554,5247,2009-03-26,5,This worked great for Recipe #43585 (which were great). I'm very glad I found this one since I don't use alot of self-rising flour. Will use quite often. Thanks.
242484,5247,2010-02-09,5,Thanks!  You're a life saver! Needed some for frying chicken and your recipe came to my rescue!
173579,5247,2010-06-25,5,Nice recipe to have around.  Thanks for posting.
789516,5247,2011-02-21,5,Used this to make greek cheese and olive quick bread.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks!
1179225,5247,2011-05-23,5,So much cheaper than buying sefl-rising flour. I'll never buy it again. Thanks so much for posting!
383346,5247,2012-02-20,5,wonderful recipe.  No need to buy self-rising flour.  It's so easy to do when we need this for a recipe.  I needed it for a cake and it was perfect.  Thanks hcopeland :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
400708,5247,2012-08-16,5,Went to make recipe#429494 and didn't have self rising flour - used this and it worked perfect - I'll be using it from now on whenever the need arises.
540346,5247,2013-02-06,5,I used this for some sweet potato muffins that called for self-rising flour.  The muffins came out great.
146486,89204,2004-08-12,5,This is so easy to make and tastes great leftover too.  Had it with some wild rice and garlic bread. YUM!
68884,89204,2004-08-12,4,"Really good! I used 15 oz of salsa & 8 oz of light cream cheese, and followed your directions exactly. The house smelled sooo good when I got home!! Before serving, I added about 3/4 cup of cooked rice -- I wanted to wrap the mixture in tortillas, and it seemed a bit ""juicy"" for that, so i added the rice --- DH & I both enjoyed, and I'll make again!"
121185,89204,2004-08-18,2,Sorry this was not a winner at my house.  Family of 5 - all disliked this.  It was super easy - but really frustrating to see 4 chick. breasts go down the disposal...
104295,89204,2004-09-05,4,"Pretty good.  I didn't get to eat it hot (had to take my son to the ER instead), but it was pretty good reheated.  I left out the corn because I didn't have any (we don't do canned veggies and I was out of frozen), and used fat free cream cheese.  That did not melt all the way (I did not expect it to), and would probably recommend low-fat instead.  A decent fast dinner.  Thanks."
140806,89204,2004-10-01,5,"This recipe is delightful-and so simple! I started this dish on my lunch break and when I came home from work, the house was filled with a wonderful aroma. I strongly suggest using regular cream cheese at room temperature, not low fat or fat free. The chicken turned out so tender. This meal has instantly become a favorite. I served it with brown rice."
176615,89204,2005-01-26,5,"I'll just add another 5* review here! Very tender chicken and tasty, too. The beans and corn really stretch this recipe, servings are very generous portions. I served with Perfect Brown Rice recipe #56242. Would be as spicy as your salsa; I used mild so it was fine for the kids. Also used light cream cheese which did not melt into the dish but I didn't care cause it still tasted good. Even my crockpot hating husband liked this one. Thanks, Jen!"
59473,89204,2005-02-20,5,DD prepared this last night when she had us over for dinner. It was delicious. She served it over spaghetti. She used reduced fat cream cheese but it still had lots of flavour. Thanks for a great recipe.
53932,89204,2005-03-13,4,"I was hesitant to try this, but it was much better than I expected. Next time, I think I would add garlic powder, too."
172369,89204,2005-03-25,5,"This was very good, my son would not eat it, which is normal.  But I'm going to try it in a totilla next time.  Mine had a lot mote liquid than the photo. Thanks for a great recipe."
44383,89204,2005-03-30,5,"This was extremely tasty and came out very well.  Another minute or so and the chicken would have been overdone so 5 hours for 4 breasts is too long depending on your slow cooker. Mine seems to cook everything fairly fast so next time, I'll try 4 hours.  No matter, both DH and I liked it served with jasmine rice and I have added it to my keeper file.  Thanks!"
199020,89204,2005-06-17,5,"This was a really good recipe. My husband and I both enjoyed it, and it was very easy to make.  It is a good combination of ingredients.  I'm thinking about substituting sour cream for the cream cheese next time to see how it turns out."
64934,89204,2005-06-22,5,"How can soemthing so simply turn out so tasty?  I followed the recipe to a T, using boneless chicken breasts and I found four and a half hours cooking time was perfect.  This was a big hit in our house, and will definitely be made again!  Thanks!"
9869,89204,2005-08-09,5,"We loved this easy dinner dish, I added a shake of garlic powder and onion salt before adding the cream cheese then gently stirred.
Served over steamed rice.
Delicious."
52262,89204,2005-09-10,4,"The recipe was very simple to make which is always a good thing.  My husband and I thought the chicken was good, but my kids wouldn't eat it.  I made it more visually appealing by serving it over brown rice one night and linguine another night."
74652,89204,2005-10-31,5,This was really good!  I love cooking in my Crocpot and this was so easy.  I usually have all these ingredients on hand so this will be a regular at my house.  I served it over rice and sprinkled Cheddar Cheese and Green Onions over the top!
97579,89204,2005-12-29,4,This was very good.  Kids are picky so they didn't eat it but me & hubby sure enjoyed it!  I put in 6 chicken breasts and could have even added a few more with how much sauce there is.  Yummy!
137911,89204,2006-04-18,5,"It's been a while since I made this so I thought I would review again.  I used a 30 oz can of black beans because that's what I had on hand.  I also used frozen chicken tenders, about 8 of them.  It turned out wonderful...I'm kinda glad I used the larger can of black bean.  I also used a little hot taco sauce sprinkled on the finished dish to add some kick. This is a super, no-fuss recipe for a busy cook."
40961,89204,2006-04-20,5,"I made this today. I used a 19 oz can of Progresso black beans, drained and rinsed. A 16oz.jar of La Victoria mild salsa. An 11oz. can of Green Giant Mexicorn. I put it over the frozen boneless chicken breasts. I left it in the crock pot for 4 hours on high. I put the bar of cream cheese on top for 1/2 an hour. I took a large spoon and mixed it all together. The chicken shredded so easily. It tastes delicious. I plan to put it inside whole wheat tortillas. I will be making this often, I'm sure. Thanks for sharing a great recipe. "
207176,89204,2006-05-09,4,"DH liked it the most.  I think I would add salt next time.  I used fresh chicken and I rinsed and drained the black beans. I added cumin, chili powder, garlic and cilantro.  Used the sour cream and cream cheese blend.  I think with salt I'd give it a 5.  Thanks."
278113,89204,2006-05-31,5,"Fabulous!! I added some garlic powder, and white rice when it was done. We rolled the mix in flour tortillas, and it was a hit! We will make this again and again, thanks for sharing!"
294000,89204,2006-05-31,5,"You can't ask for anything easier or tastier than this.  DH said this is ""a keeper"".  Great sauce...we served it over brown rice.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks."
55578,89204,2006-06-09,4,"This was good!  Not pretty to look at, but an easy filling recipe."
147109,89204,2006-06-28,4,"Well I don't think this needs another review, but hey, what is one more.  As a general rule I don't eat beans, never have, mostly because I don't like the texture of beans.  Beans are however, well a cheap source of protein so I have been scouring the websites for bean recipes that I might actually eat.  This recipe fits the bill.  Although I did not think it was the best thing since sliced bread, it is a good solid recipe.  I used frozen corn, and I cut up the chicken into pieces (not frozen) and decreased the cooking time and served over rice.  I think next time I will use the leftovers (with the rice) in a tortilla.  Thanks!"
89831,89204,2006-09-26,3,"Sorry to give such a low review on this recipe, the taste was so bland, I even browned the chicken firstly and also sauteed some onions, and garlic and slow-cooked it in my oven, we had to throw away the sauce and just eat the chicken (big waste of ingredients!) my family would not eat it, and they usually eat everything! Oh well everyone has different tastes, I will definately not be making this again, but thanks for sharing anyway...Kitten"
383346,89204,2006-11-28,4,"I used 6 boneless chicken breasts, 19 ounce of black beans, 19 ounce of frozen corn, 340 ml of medium salsa, and a low fat cream cheese.

I liked it cause it was easy to do and delicious on egg noodles."
140132,89204,2006-12-15,5,"I made this last night for dinner.  Fantastic flavors for something so simple.  I used chili beans instead of black beans, as this was what i had on hand and I used my own homemade salsa.  So simple yet so delicious.  We served this on noodles and was a big hit by all especially DH .  Thank you for a definate keeper....Stephanie"
125640,89204,2006-12-28,5,"The first time I made this, I made it exactly as directed and it wasn't the most flavorful meal we'd ever had, but it was ridiculously easy and the chicken was so tender it was falling apart, so I tried it again with a few adjustments. The cream cheese seemed to mellow out the flavor of the salsa much more than I had anticipated so this time I used the medium heat Cowboy Poet Salsa and spinkled a little bit of onion powder, garlic salt, and ground chipotle powder on top. This time I also added 3/4 cup frozen spinach with the rest of the vegetables and served it over rice. This time DH commented on how tasty it was. And we were surprised to find that this was even better as leftovers. It makes great filling for both burritos and chimichangas."
132764,89204,2007-02-14,2,"I've had this in my cookbook for a long time, and was really looking forward to such a well rated recipe, but it fell short of my expectations. I had hoped that a long time in the crockpot would meld the ingredients, but the beans and corn seemed to just stand alone here. It was VERY runny, even though I drained everything, and it was missing a lot flavorwise. Never one to waste food, I'll be thickening the sauce (and adding some seasonings)today, and shredding the chicken in hopes of turning it into a meal we can enjoy. Sorry, but I won't be making this again."
184723,89204,2007-02-25,5,"I just wanted to edit my review to say I have made this at least 15 times.  It is my husband's favorite ""dip""!!  We make it exactly as stated except at 4 hours (when chicken is done) I pull the chicken out of the crockpot and shred it with a fork, pop it back in the crockpot, add the cream cheese and about 1-2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese.  We then put in a big serving bowl with a side of Tostitos 'Scoops' chips and serve as the best dip ever.  Thanks so much for this recipe... I'll be making it over and over for the next 20 years!!! :)"
142335,89204,2007-03-12,5,So delicious and so easy! I'll be making this again. Thanks!
236170,89204,2007-04-03,5,I loved this recipe and plan on sharing it with my family and friends! It was so easy and had so few ingredients. I shredded the chicken before serving it over egg noodles.
377581,89204,2007-05-24,4,"Very good, easy dinner. I used frozen corn and added just a dash each of onion salt, garlic powder and ground red pepper with excellent results. I used medium salsa and it was perfect for us. We loved the corn and black beans. I served it with rice. Thank you for a great recipe."
265954,89204,2007-06-30,4,"This is delicious.  My only issue is that, when the cream cheese mixes with the salsa, this results in an unappetizing color.  Next time, I will make this recipe using shredded cheddar cheese, instead.  Thank you for posting!"
218535,89204,2007-09-25,5,Wonderful dish. I used spicy salsa which gives it the right amount of kick. Will use again and again.
8688,89204,2007-10-20,4,"A recipe certainly doesn't get much easier than this!  I made as directed, cooking on low until the chicken was tender. Interesting taste combination!  Thanks, Jen Santiago!"
173314,89204,2007-10-23,4,Was easy and good. cut up the chicken and served over rice.  will make again. kids were a little picky about it. omitted corn. thanks
499050,89204,2007-12-01,4,Good
174991,89204,2007-12-09,3,I used 2 boneless breast with the remaining ingredients and it was too bland for us.  I added 3 Tlb of chile powder and it was much better.
222564,89204,2007-12-23,5,"Great, and the good news for those of us who don't have a crock pot is, that it can be done quite easily without it, as well.
I cut the chicken in strips, browned it in little oil, added salsa and corn with its liquid and simmered all slowly for 20 minutes. Added the beans, simmered 10 minutes, added cream cheese and just heated through before serving.
Delish topped with cilantro."
103876,89204,2008-01-13,4,"Very tasty, but the color made it not look very appetizing.  I may use less cream cheese if I make it again."
358796,89204,2008-01-13,4,"The flavor is very, very good. A lot of it depends on the salsa you use- so use a flavorful one! I cooked mine 5 hours, and the chicken felt a little dry though."
49304,89204,2008-01-19,5,"Absolutely DELICIOUS, so easy to make, Served it with a salad. I used a pint of my home canned salsa and a 8 ounce package of cream cheese cut into small chunks. I made enchiladas with the leftovers, they were Delicious,using corn tortillas.Thank you VERY much for posting this easy to make recipe which I will definitely be making again & again.UPDATE 1-19-08 Everyone love this recipe & asks  for it. Usually serve with a green salad & Multi grain or whole wheat tortillas."
251917,89204,2008-02-08,3,My family liked this dish but my husband would have prefered it without the cream cheese - maybe that is what we will do next time.
92886,89204,2008-02-13,4,"I have seen this on zaar for the longest time, but since I'm not a big cream cheese fan, I had never tried it.  The other day I needed a crock pot recipe and happened to have 4ozs of left over cream cheese, so I went ahead and gave it a try.  I was so pleased with the out come.  I did defrost the chicken first (to cut down on the liquid) I used a nice spicy paul Newman salsa and I sprinkled the finished product with cilantro.  I think the 8 ozs of cream cheese would have been too much for me, but the 4ozs was just right.  I will put this in my ""go to"" crock pot file."
486718,89204,2008-02-18,5,OMG this was soooo good!!  I didn't use corn as DH doesn't like it but I didn't miss it.  This was so easy! I shredded the chicken and served in fresh tortilla shell and it was a hit. Will be making this one again and again.  Thanks!!
264017,89204,2008-02-19,4,"This was very tasty and super easy. I literally tossed everything in the crockpot before work and cooked on low for 6 hours. I turned it on high for one hour when I got home and it was not mushy at all, like chicken in the crockpot sometimes can be. The only reason I dropped this down a star was because of the appearance. That pinkish color wasn't very appealing to my family. Thanks for sharing!"
232480,89204,2008-03-06,4,Very good.  I shredded the chicken before adding the cream cheese and we served it on flour tortillas - yum!
199792,89204,2008-03-15,4,This made a very easy and tasty dinner. There was a bit of an odd taste that I think was from the low-fat cream cheese (I didn't take a star away because that was my choice and not the fault of the recipe). I did put it over rice but I enjoyed it more with tortilla chips. I look forward to trying the leftovers in a wrap. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
187281,89204,2008-03-16,4,Nice easy dish with a yummy flavor.  We used sour cream instead of cream cheese to cut calories and it worked great.  This is best served inside tortillas for my family's taste.
131021,89204,2008-03-24,5,"I often use reduced fat cream cheese and frozen corn. I went looking in my recipe reviews for this and couldn't find it. I can't believe I never reviewed it. I have passed it on to at least two other people and one of them has passed it on several times so it is a big hit. My Dh loves it and will be so excited to find out that we are having it for dinner. I love that it doesn't take a lot of prep time or special ingredients, just stuff I always have on hand. I also like that I can just open a can of carrots and we have dinner. Thanks so much for a great recipe that we use all the time."
229850,89204,2008-04-06,4,"We thought this was good, but was a little bland even though I used a spicy salsa.This was good in a tortilla and also as a dip as other reviewers stated. Thanx for the change o pace recipe."
371738,89204,2008-05-16,5,Tasty and even better when the chicken falls apart and you eat this with tortilla chips.
426903,89204,2008-05-29,5,"Yum is right!!! This was a really surprising dish. Even though it had gotten tons of reviews, I was still skeptical about the flavor I anticipated. However, I am so glad I gave this recipe a try. It was easy and FULL of flavor. I put it on top of noodles and added some monterey cheese. This is a definite keeper. Thanks for posting."
252816,89204,2008-06-05,0,"After reading reviews,I decided to use thawed chicken breast..I made half this recipe for just my DH and myself..After cooking for 4 hours there was alot of liquid in the pot,so I drained it,shredded the chicken and added cream cheese..Served as wraps in flour tortillas along with spicy refried beaans, corn cake and a chicken chimichunga with green pepper sauce......Good flavor.And so easy to make...Will definitely make this again...Thank U for this recipe.."
333017,89204,2008-07-08,4,"You know....for something ridiculously simple....that was really good!  I froze the chicken breast seperately so that it would fit in my crock pot easily...and not in one big clump.  Because I knew I was going to be out of the house most of the afternoon and not sure of the timming, I put my crock pot on simmer thinking that I could always blast it for the last hour cooking.  It was cooked in 5-1/2 hours (on simmer) and the chicken turned out moist and delicious.  I cut the chicken into chunks and served this with mixed grain rice for a very satisfying dinner.   Hint: to clean those stubborn stains on the base unit....remove the crockpot when the cooking time is finished and clean any residule stains while the pot is still hot.  This recipe would have got a 5 star if it was company worthy....but it is perfect for casual dinning or family."
914720,89204,2008-09-06,5,"Five stars for both ease of preparation and taste.  Used light cream cheese, and shredded the chicken when done.  Served over egg noodles the first night, then used the leftovers in a layered  ""enchilada casserole"" with torn corn tortillas, canned enchilada sauce, and Mexican blend cheese.  Even the picky seven year old liked it.  Will use this technique for any Mexican recipes calling for cooked chicken."
13796,89204,2008-10-12,5,"It looked awful but tasted good! I subbed kidney beans for the black beans as they were all I had on hand. I omitted the corn (personal preference). I added a few freshly chopped jalapeno slices for some zip.
I used bone-in breasts (not frozen) and they were very tender and not dry at all. I cooked them on high for 5 hours and they were perfectly cooked."
37036,89204,2008-11-17,4,"I enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the directions, but cooked it on low for about 9 hours.  It turned out good.  I served with rice and tortillas."
189475,89204,2008-11-22,5,This is SO good! I made burritos with it and they were delicious.
969481,89204,2008-12-29,4,I made this over penne pasta and that just did not mix well. I think next time I make this it will be over brown rice. I did add some sliced green onions to add some color and a touch of flavor.
1072593,89204,2009-01-06,5,"""Ye-ah baby""!  Uh, I sounded just like Austin Powers.  This is a complete surprise of a dish.  Tenatively you start our hoping for the best and thinking how in the heck is all this going to work and then....voila!  Whomever created this was genious!"
353131,89204,2009-02-01,4,"Made this without the corn and used homemade salsa. Also, cooked black beans instead of using canned and used fresh chicken breast instead of frozen. This recipe is certainly easy. I added salt and pepper. When we got home from church Dh thought the house smelled wonderful! I cooked it for 4 hrs. on high. Served with rice but I will make tortillas to serve the leftovers with. Very good, will make again!"
145352,89204,2009-02-03,5,I've been making this recipe for years. We call it Chicken Santa Fe. The only difference is I use 2 cans of corn. I love cutting up the chicken and serving it in tortillas!
844554,89204,2009-03-09,5,"Add me to the list of YUM reviewers. I added garlic powder, cumin, chili powder and red pepper flakes to the chicken and only used 4 oz. of cream cheese. It was very, very tasty. Will make again and again. Thanks for this winner!"
132383,89204,2009-04-22,5,I think I have had this recipe in my cookbook for years!  We finally got around to making it and now I am sorry we waited so long.  Was delicious and easy.  Leftovers were just as good which is a plus!
847160,89204,2009-04-27,5,First the taste was kind of weird but then i became addictid to it and almost eat the whole recipe by my self and on top of it i use low fat philadelfia cream cheese and a little more corn.... it was perfect...  thanks
389431,89204,2009-06-29,5,"This was wonderful!  Served it for my family when they came to help with a few home repairs and it was very well received.  I did add an envelope of homemade taco seasoning, about 3 cloves of garlic and one home grown jalapeno pepper...  it was just spicy enough to have interest, but not so much that you didn't enjoy the flavors of the meal.  My mom even asked for the recipe!  Thank you so very much!"
1122161,89204,2009-07-27,3,"I felt the sauce in this was a bit too runny, so I would use half the salsa next time. I also thought there was way too much cream cheese. I would put halve the amount of that too. My crockpot cooked the chicken in 1 1/2 hours on high, but it is a Rival brand and cooks really fast. I do think this is a nice idea for burritos, and like another reviewer suggested to shredd some cheese and wrap in a burrito would be great. Thanks for posting!"
269331,89204,2009-10-12,5,"Really easy to make! I used 6 frozen boneless skinless chicken thighs and cooked on high for 5 hours. The thighs do not really shred, but easily cut with a fork. I served over white rice and garnished with green onions and avocado. Nice inexpensive recipe to make."
637486,89204,2009-11-05,5,"I was surprised at how good this was considering how easy it is to make.  This must be the easiest dinner to make!  The only changes I made was to cook it on low for 8 hours.  I put the chicken in frozen and while a lot of the other reviews said that it came out slightly watery, mine was on the dry side.  After I added the cream cheese, I added about 1/4 cup of water to make it a little saucier.  Next time I think I will add 1/4 cup of water at the beginning to see if that helps.  I served it over rice and lets just say I will be making this again and again!"
439797,89204,2010-01-19,5,I messed up at first and cooked it on low for about 5 hours - it was still raw.  Turned it up to high for 1.5 hours and it was great.  Used the leftover sauce over pasta and that was terrific also.
195589,89204,2010-01-25,5,"Great recipe, esp. when it is SO easy and you can get 2 meals out of it like we did. Like others, I added some sour cream and reduced the cream cheese a bit. Next time I will try adding some taco seasoning as another reviewer suggested. The next day, we shredded the chicken and made tacos with all of the trimmings. Thanks for posting Jen."
32058,89204,2010-02-17,5,"A new family favorite! I used 5 LARGE chicken breasts, and doubled everything else. It was DELICIOUS over  rice. We always top with sour cream and cheddar cheese"
839492,89204,2010-06-03,4,"My daughter's favorite is Yummy Crock Pot Shredded Chicken for Tacos! from this site. I thought I'd try this (very highly rated) recipe since the ingredients are similar (with my tweaks, see review on that recipe). She says she likes these even better. I think she'd eat a block of cream cheese by itself if she could. Simplicity is key here. I didn't have canned corn, used 12 oz.frozen with great results. Put in about a tablespoon of cumin, 2 cloves of garlic & juice of a half a lime and a bit of hot sauce (some people indicated it was bland). Didn't have any problems with it being too watery at all. We'll be making this again.Thanks for sharing!"
368078,89204,2010-06-04,5,"10++. We loved this!!  We used fresh chicken breasts (3) and cooked on low for 5 hours.  We also used frozen corn, 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, which we thought gave it a good kick, and cilantro garlic salsa.  We added fresh cilantro on top.  This was perfect, and we know this will be a recipe we will make often!  Thanks, Jen!"
111291,89204,2010-08-27,0,"Okay, so I know this recipe doesn't need another review, but I have to say, it is simply delicious!  I followed the recipe as posted, except added 2 cobs of fresh cut corn!  We ate it when it was more ""soupy"" on top of noodles.  I kept the remainder in the crock pot on high without the lid for another 1-2 hours (stirring often)...this thickened it and the next day we warmed it up and enjoyed the leftovers as a yummy dip with tortilla chips.  THANKS for an easy and yummy recipe.  Will make often!"
226863,89204,2010-09-04,4,"I love using my crock pot and like to look for new things to do in it.  This was easy to put together, already had pretty much everything I needed!  When the cook time was over, I shredded my chicken to it would be easy to eat over noodles. Think I'll try it over crushed chips next time.  Thanks for sharing!"
185926,89204,2011-03-21,4,"This gets five stars for easy.  I added garlic, oregano and paprika as per other suggestions.  My husband loves it, my kids and I are OK with it.  But it is great for an easy crockpot dinner.  Thank you."
315055,89204,2010-11-13,3,"This was just okay, I tried serving it with rice which didn't taste that great, but then I put it into tortilla shells (soft) and served them and they were a lot better.  I don't have any suggestions for improvements, I guess it just wasn't my style."
937635,89204,2010-12-20,2,"Unfortunately we didn't really like it. I was excited to make it from the reviews, but DH and I just weren't into it. The beans and cream cheese created a weird texture and the taste was really bland (we even used the salsa recc by several reviewers). I think I might try to put the leftovers (there were tons!) in tortillas and make them as enchiladas tomorrow."
456858,89204,2011-08-27,4,"This was good.  I doubted how it was going to taste because it didn't look or smell that appetizing.  But, I continued with the recipe, and following the suggestion from another post, I did shred the chicken and then threw the cream cheese on top.  It was def easy and good.  I wonder how this would taste with sour cream instead of the cream cheese?  Any one willing to try it out, or has anyone used sour cream in place of the cream cheese?"
2041603,89204,2011-10-25,5,My family and friends LOVE this recipe! I typically add two cans of beans and guess at the corn (I use frozen) and this dish has never failed us. We serve over rice on tortillas. It also freezes well! Yum!
407007,89204,2011-09-11,5,"I've made this twice now, and both times it was fantastic! I love how easy it is to make and how yummy it turns out. :) I enjoyed mine on tortillas like tacos. My one year old loves it too!!"
1052873,89204,2012-02-20,5,"Kind of pointless to be review #1399, but this was great. I had to dispatch a nasty rooster, about a year old, and used the breast and thigh meat. Low for 6 hours, shredded the meat, added 8 oz cream cheese until it melted, served on warmed tortillas."
2549237,89204,2013-03-30,4,"This is a good base recipe, but it definitely needs tweaked to be made more to our liking.  I followed the recipe to the letter this time and we found that it was very, very bland.  If I make this again, I will definitely spice the chicken up and use hot salsa.  Also I will add canned chiles.  It was a decent recipe, just not a favorite in our household.  UPDATE: Made again 2/13/13 and used a 24 oz jar of Great Value Hot Salsa and stirred in cooked rice just before serving and this tasted much better.  Our family likes things a little spicy, so the hot salsa and the extra quantity really helped to make this something we can enjoy often.  Thanks Jen.&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE: Made for a third time on 3/30/13 and used a homemade salsa from this site ( Recipe #485128 ) and the recipe was sooooooo much better.  I am even bumping the star rating from 3 to 4.  I want to love this recipe so much because it is so easy, but it still needs a little more work.  I will continue to tweak it on days when I need crock pot meals.  Thanks again Jen."
191533,89204,2013-09-06,4,"Good, not great."
198154,89204,2014-09-24,4,This is so simple to throw together.  I got everything going in the crock pot in the morning.  When I came home I added the cream cheese and cooked some brown rice.  I used homemade salsa and low fat cream cheese.  The family really enjoyed it.  I ate the leftover corn/bean/salsa sauce over the rice for lunch and that was just as yummy.
32772,89204,2014-10-30,5,"I love this recipe just the way it is posted. I put in three thawed chicken breasts with the other ingredients on top. I cooked into on low for six hours. When I went to add the cream cheese, the toppings were a little dry. I added about 1/2 cup of water and then the cream cheese. Next time, I will add a can of diced tomatoes to give some more liquid. I also didn&#039;t shredded my chicken bfeasts. I served it on top of garlic butter spiral noodles. A great combination of favors."
1581225,89204,2016-10-26,4,"I have made this a few times now. It's definitely better with a spicier salsa rather than a mild one. It's a very tasty and filling dish, not to mention so easy. I usually serve it with white rice. One thing I do differently is cook the chicken from fresh/defrosted rather than frozen, as one of the other reviews suggested cooking from frozen in a slow cooker is unsafe."
1133190,89204,2017-09-05,5,This recipe obviously doesn't need another 5 star rating but I'm going to give it one anyway. It's great! I haven't experimented with different salsas yet but that would be fun. I have used frozen corn instead of canned and that works great. I also typically use reduced fat cc and it tastes wonderful! I often only use 3 chicken breasts so it's more saucy. Serve it on a bed of rice or in a tortilla! Thanks for this gem of a recipe I'm sure I'll be making it often!
250031,261889,2008-02-11,5,"My daughter made these today to send to her boyfriend who lives in Oklahoma for Valentine's Day. They came out perfectly! They taste awesome and the icing harden just right!  Thank you, Kittencal, you made my daughter's day!(We are uploading a photo!)"
632249,261889,2008-02-13,5,"We only used the icing part of the recipe and it works great.  My daughter is taking Valentine Cookies to school and since we were bagging the cookies for each child, we needed  an icing which would harden. Thx."
68884,128473,2005-09-28,4,"I halved the recipe with ease, baking it in an 8x8 pan. I used whole-wheat spaghetti noodles, turkey pepperoni and added sliced mushrooms to the pepperoni layer. This was good, but I think the sauce ratio is too much - I didn't use the amount called for and still had plenty. I also think it would benefit from adding some spices or maybe some parmesan to the noodle layer. This would be great to use up leftover spaghetti noodles, & I think kids would like it. :)  I made this as part of Pick A Chef 2005"
176615,128473,2005-10-04,5,"The kids and DH loved it, which is an automatic 5-star at my house! Very simple to put together and fun to eat which made it great for a busy baseball night. I used a sheet pan (about 12x17) with whole wheat thin spaghetti and one 26 oz jar of pasta sauce. Only put pepperoni on half, for the kids who only eat cheese, and used 4-5 cups cheese. My pan was full to the top. This is basic, kid-friendly recipe and other pizza type toppings could be added as desired. Thanks, BFM!"
359220,261889,2008-12-13,5,"Fantastic, yummy, easy and quick...that's how I would describe these babies!  I'm new to cut outs and these couldn't have been more simple.  Only had about a hour to get these in the oven before my niece and nephew came over for decorating, so I tossed the dough in the freezer for about 30-40 minutes and didn't have any problems.  Kept their shapes wonderfully and were soft- yum!  Thanks Kitten for another winner!"
774665,261889,2008-12-18,5,I love these cookies. They taste great even after reworking and reworking by little hands. You do have to make sure you pop the dough in the fridge or they'll stick to your countertop but it's very easy to work with and tastes great! Thanks!
124190,261889,2008-12-21,5,"Great recipe! The dough is great. I found that I needed my table and pin to be well floured, but otherwise, it was wonderful. The cookies came out soft and delicious. Great icing recipe as well. These will definitely be added to my holiday gift trays. Thanks!  Made for the Kittencal cookathon."
368078,261889,2008-12-22,5,"These were the best sugar cookies I've ever had!  They were soft to eat, yet didn't puff up or lose their shape when I baked them.  We used 3/4 t vanilla instead of the vanilla and almond extract, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  Thanks Kittencal!"
316717,261889,2008-12-25,5,great recipe!  very easy and dough was very easy to work w/. so easy that i gave the kids a chunk of dough and they were able to roll it out and cut it out themselves with out my help. icing came out great too. used i think 3-4 tablespoons of milk to the consistency that i wanted. will put this in my favorites file.
13796,261889,2009-02-19,5,Very good cookies. I made the dough and didn't get a chance to cut out the cookies.. so I just sliced them and smeared the icing on them and topped with colored sugars. They were a hit!
199020,261889,2009-04-12,4,"These cookies definitely held their shape and were very pretty with pastel icing for Easter. They weren't my favorite sugar cookies, but they were good. I like mine more on the chewy side. These reminded me of Lofthouse brand, which most people love."
172369,261889,2009-07-25,5,"Loved this recipe, easy and delish! Made exactly as written for an open house (in the shape of a house). Thanks for sharing another great recipe. I will make these again"
158086,261889,2009-12-18,5,I just made the frosting but it was perfect...thank you so much..
620763,261889,2009-10-27,5,"These are great, but they really do need the icing because they are not very sweet. Paired with the icing, they are perfect. I baked mine at 375 for about 8 minutes. They held their shape well."
187373,261889,2009-11-08,0,"I won't leave stars, but just thought I'd share.  I know it says no sub for butter, but I didn't have anything else in the house. I used light margarine and they were wonderful--soft and chewy.  They just couldn't roll out, so I made drop cookies. So subbing for the butter does work (kind of) as long as you're okay with drop cookies.  Also didn't make the icing...next time I'll make it the right way and try the icing.  thanks, Kittencal!"
46660,261889,2009-12-14,5,"I only used the icing from this recipe. It was fabulous! Nice and glossy, hardened beautifully! I used almond extract. Thank you!"
97579,261889,2009-12-15,5,Loved the ease of this dough!  I made mine a little thicker (just my preference) and they were great!  I have another batch in the fridge just waiting!  I used my cookie frosting which is a butter based frosting and they are amazing!!!
426903,261889,2009-12-21,5,"Very nice cookie recipe, we enjoyed them very much! Thanks for posting!"
135887,261889,2009-12-22,4,I only used the dough recipe and it was great.  Had to chill longer than 2 hours.  I chose not t use the icing recipe because I wasn't sure what it the consistency would be like (when you mentioned using a paint brush).   We like our frosting!
103876,261889,2010-02-14,5,"You are absolutely right!  These cookies are perfect in all ways.  The dough was a breeze to handle, the flavor fantastic and the directions right on.  I made the dough ahead of time and refrigerated over night.  I used another reviewer's suggestion of yardsticks to roll the dough evenly.  Baked for 6 minutes and they were just right.  They look and taste wonderful.  Why look elsewhere when it doesn't get any better than this?  Perfect Valentine's treat for my husband.  Thanks for posting!"
188119,261889,2010-02-14,5,"great recipe! Made heart cookies for valentines day with my fiancee :).
Thank you!"
140806,261889,2010-02-15,5,"Loved the almond flavor of these cookies and icing! Made Valentine's Day special this year. My 2yo DS kept sneaking cookies off the plate when he thought we weren't looking...and he doesn't even like sweets! My cookies were a touch on the dry side, so next time I'll add less flour. Other than that, these cookies are tremendous! Rolled my dough between two pieces of wax paper to cut down on the mess."
1072593,261889,2010-04-03,5,"Four batches and the two lifetimes to make these with the grandbabes, I have now even greater respect for the Easter Bunny...and for that matter, Santa Clause, The Tooth Fairy and any other diety dealing with kids."
529278,261889,2010-06-16,5,"FANTASTIC!!!  I've always shied away from cutouts because my moms were so crunchy, and I didn't realize they could be soft and delicious.  These are wonderful.  The dough was quick and easy to prepare, it rolled, cut, and baked nicely, and they taste good to boot!  And the frosting - I was scraping the bowl to lick up all that I could!  I did add a little more sugar to the dough and rolled in powdered sugar, as suggested by one reviewer.  Only problems were getting it out of the bowl (I had to scrape it out with my fingernails, even after it had been sitting out for a while) and we needed a smidge more frosting, as 3 were left naked because I ran out.  Perhaps had I not eaten so much, though....."
389431,261889,2010-11-14,5,I made these to serve as favors for my daughters first birthday party and they were a huge hit!!  Everyone loved them!<br/>The dough was so easy to work with!  And the icing was exactly what I needed... it hardened up quickly so I could move quickly... <br/>Thanks!!
808027,261889,2010-12-14,5,"Having baked sugar cookies forever as a Christmas tradition, I decided to try these this year because of all the rave reviews.  No WONDER...they are awesome...they make a beautiful cookie that is soft, not too sweet and the dough is incredibly easy to work with.  Doubled the recipe to make a TON of cookies for my kids' annual cookie decorating party and cannot thank you enough for this amazing recipe.  Throw out the other sugar cookies, folks -- this is THE ONE!  Kittencal rocks!!!"
315055,261889,2010-12-20,4,"The frosting is great and does what it's supposed to do...the cookies, on the otherhand, are why I gave it 4 stars.  They look fabulous, but are lacking something in flavor that I can't put my finger on.  Maybe they just have too much flour in them.  They taste great with buttercream frosting (my frosting of choice), but I wouldn't really eat these alone."
532289,261889,2010-12-21,5,Another great recipe by Kittencal.  These are better than the iced sugar cookies I pay $1 for at my local bakery.  I won't by them any more.  My kids have eaten almost the whole batch in less than a day.  Thanks for sharing.
140132,261889,2011-01-29,5,"Your right, these are the best.  DD#2 needed to take something for her french class and she wanted to make sugar cookies spelling each of their names so I chose your recipe because of the frosting that hardens.  These are fantastic.  The dough mixed up easily and when it came time to roll out it was smooth and easy.  They didn't stick to my countertop and then they baked up so nice.  The frosting was just as easy to put together.  We just loved them.  DD#1 is already planning on using this recipe for her valentines presents to friends.  Thank you so much Kittencalskitchen, you never steer us wrong."
1179225,261889,2011-10-21,5,I wanted to have a little fun today and make some decorated Halloween  cookies. I remembered seeing your recipe for these cookies a while back and couldn't wait to have an occasion to try them. The dough was so easy to make and baked up just perfect. I had to bake mine about 7 minutes. I used large cookie cutters so it was easiest to paint the icing on. I loved that the cookies weren't horribly sweet. Thanks so much for shraring another fantastic recipe.
540346,261889,2013-05-30,3,"I hate to say it that I am not a huge fan of this sugar cookie.  They cooked very well and kept their shape, but they were not sweet at all (and I put icing on them) and they didn&#039;t have much flavor.  I will keep looking for a different recipe."
1133190,261889,2013-12-15,5,Perfect sugar cookie.  Soft and chewy if you make them on on the thick side and don&#039;t over bake.  The flavor is fantastic! This will be our go to sugar cookie recipe from now on!
175824,261889,2013-12-17,5,What can I say that hasn&#039;t been said already. Delicious!!. Easy to make. The dough is wonderful to work with. It is a beautiful dough. I will always use this recipe. Thanks for sharing such a top-shelf recipe.I have theses many times and I put the icing in squeeze bottles. A different color for each color. I thin out the icing a little more than what the recipe calls for but it does make much easier and faster to decorate. This is really such a wonderful recipe.
350750,261889,2013-12-27,5,"Made these for Santa.  They were easily mixed with the KitchenAid, I did use vanilla in place of the almond flavoring.  I didn&#039;t bother with the frosting because they were that good, but thinking about making them again and using the frosting...maybe!  Thank you!"
126440,261889,2014-02-09,5,I think I rolled mine too thin but the flavor and icing turned out great.  Made half a recipe and got 8 of the large 7 inch snowflake cookies.
242484,261889,2014-02-14,5,My husband said these were hands-down the best sugar cookies he&#039;s ever tasted!  I especially love how the icing had a nice gloss to it but hardened completely so I could package them into plastic bags for gifts!  Perfect cookie!
1581225,261889,2017-06-03,5,"These were sooo yummy. I enjoyed making these. My 7yo son helped ice and decorate them. We used blue icing and sprinkles. I took some into work, and they went fast. I took home an empty container that afternoon."
230557,180090,2006-12-08,5,"This soup is wonderful!  It's light and every flavor stands on it's own AND blends well with the other ingredients.  Perfect seasoning, too.  I misunderstood step one - I simply boiled my potatoes as I usually would and discarded the water instead of keeping it- but added it all later & everything was fine.   I halved the recipe and made the mashed potato part the night before and the next day I put everything in the crockpot, saving steps 9 & 10 for the last hour. I also made the addition of a 1 lb. bag of frozen corn (plus I used the entire 1 lb. bag of tiny peas even though I only made half the recipe), and used half & half rather than cream.  At first the cauliflower aroma was powerful but eventually it mellowed out - and best of all, one of my sons ate cauliflower for the first time & loved it!  I had guests when I served this and EVERYONE loved it - your recipe went home with them & it will be a permanent part of my own collection.  Thank you for sharing your Grandmother's excellent recipe Uncle Bill!"
124249,32204,2006-06-02,5,"These brownies are great! Very easy to mix up. I used chocolate chips and walnuts.

Thanks Karen =^..^=.

Bullwinkle"
110506,32204,2004-09-19,5,"BEST brownies I have ever made from scratch! I am trying to catch up on my reviews and since I found the recipe, I have made these 4 times. The first time I made a single batch and they went so fast I figured I would dbl the recipe for the next time. Well they went just as fast.
The dbl batch in a 9"" x 13"" pan ended up to be the best and they were very thick. Like almost 2"". Maybe it was an accident on my part, but it was a good one if it was. They tasted extra good with some dark chocolate ganache I had left-over . (MEAN CHEF #37844)
Thanks for a terrific recipe!! "
18391,32204,2004-10-16,5,Excellent brownies! I added nuts .. my entire family loved them! thanks!!
37449,32204,2004-10-17,5,"Mmmmm good! I used mini marshmallows and chocolate chips. The top looked kind of pockmarked, but the taste was great! I might try the cheesecake topping next. Thanks Karen!"
218535,32204,2006-06-08,3,"I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to mine. I tasted too much of the cocoa and it's not sweet enough. I prefer the other recipe ""Super Peanut Butter Filled Brownies  by shimmerchk #87864""."
58836,32204,2004-11-17,5,"These were really good brownies.  I'm sure I will make again.  I added nuts, m&m baking pieces and some other things, can't remember.  They are almost too good.  I can't stop eating.  Thanks."
142367,32204,2005-05-21,5,"The kids loved these! And the grown ups enjoyed eating them also.  These were a nice change from regular brownies and a keeper.  I mixed these up in the saucepan, thus only making one dirty container to clean -- gotta love that."
222433,32204,2006-03-11,5,Thanks Karen! Very good brownines! I used choco and white chips.  Will be making these again.
232480,32204,2006-03-12,5,"Oh my.  These are absolutely to die for.  I thought 1-2 c. of mix-ins was a lot, but went with it anyway.  I am so glad I did!  I used 1 c. of Reese's Pieces and 1 c. of mini marshmallows.  These are peanut-buttery and chocolatey and gooey and just amazing.  DH LOVES them - he's only eaten one and he's asked for another batch already!"
40961,32204,2006-05-29,5,These brownies are amazing. I made them and used 2 cups of the new Hershey's kissables for the add in. 25 minutes was perfect. They are fudgie and chocolaty and everyone loved them. I can't wait to try them with different  add-ins. Thanks for a great recipe.
173579,32204,2006-06-23,4,These were good but not what I had expected.  Thanks for posting.
147109,32204,2006-09-11,5,I added in Andes Mint pieces and it was delicious....although I would stick to only 1 cup as 2 cups was too much!  Thanks!
168462,32204,2006-09-19,5,Everyone loved these. I added chocolate chips and chopped hazelnuts.Will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.
222564,32204,2006-09-26,5,"Truly, perfectly wonderfull brownie! Rich and moist, chocolaty and dense enough to be easy to cut. With the floaters or without. I used this in a Brownie Trifle recipe and it was great in it, too!"
53932,32204,2006-10-11,5,Another 5 star rating for you!  Loved these.  I added toffee pieces and chocolate chips.  I baked mine a little too long as they didn't look done after 30 minutes but they still taste so good.  Thanks for sharing.
402559,32204,2007-01-12,5,"Great brownies, thanks!"
51011,32204,2007-02-19,5,"Well, I guess as #150 to review, there is not much more to say except they are great.  So easy to make, and really good too.  I omitted the vanilla (personal preference) and added a dash or two of cinnamon.  Thanks for sharing!"
135887,32204,2007-03-04,2,Sorry - I really wanted to like these but none of us (4) did.  I had a horrible time getting them out of the pan - they didn't stick but fell apart all over the place.  We practically had to eat them with a fork.  My kids asked me to go back to the box kind - they thought the flavor was off.
131021,32204,2007-03-16,5,"Oh My Goodness. I now really believe what all the rave reviews are saying, these were the absolute best brownies I have ever had. We added M&Ms, pecans and chocolate chips. I can't wait to try them using anything else I can find. I love that it doesn't take anything that I don't already always have on hand. This one is a keeper."
203111,32204,2007-04-07,5,"You already have so many reviews but I did want to say that these are really wonderful brownies.  Easy and quick, too. But I've got to say I really prefer them  without any add-ins. Thanks Karen!"
132764,32204,2007-04-18,5,"Thank you for this simple, straight forward brownie recipe. I always have the ingredients on hand, and it's nice to know I can play around with it a bit. I made a batch tonight using walnuts as the stir in ingredient. After I got it all mixed up, I realized my 8x8 pan was in use, so I baked them in a 9 in round pan. The cooking time of 25 mins worked out just fine. Very yummy!"
56087,32204,2007-05-23,5,"I've resisted trying this one for so long, but how can so many people be wrong???  THEY CAN'T..
This is my new go to Brownie recipe.  Loved the ease of throwing them together.  This is the recipe I've been looking for.
I made a double batch, hoping for the best.  I ""sprinkled"" PB chips on half and macadamia nuts on the other half to appease both Hubby and the Grandson.  ENTIRE batch was gone in 2 days.
Thanks for sharing this recipe."
368078,32204,2007-06-04,5,"Wow!  Very easy to make and wonderfully moist.  We made it with mini marshmallows (all we had in the house), but can't wait to try again with candy pieces.  Thanks for a great recipe!!"
74281,32204,2007-06-18,3,"In my trek for the perfect ""from scratch"" brownie I decided to try this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but I probably should have read ALL the reviews before making them as some of the reviews described them being flat, or thin and dry and that is exactly how ours turned out. My daughter thought they were fine, but unfortunately no one else really loved them, they said they were just okay. I hesitated to review these because I think the problem is not the recipe, but personal preference as we like our brownies to be more chewy and dense. I agree they are really fudgy. In fact they almost seem like fudge bars to me instead of brownies. Sorry!"
278113,32204,2007-07-20,5,"Add another 5 stars from me! These could not be easier to make..and some of the best I have eaten. The kids loved them, and we will be making these regularly in our home. Thanks for sharing this fantasic recipe!"
347822,32204,2007-08-08,5,"Amazing recipe!  Quick, easy, varying and delicious.  I doubled the recipe. For walnut brownies, I added to the batter, 2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips, 1 cup chopped walnuts. Added another 1 cup chopped walnuts for topping. Baked in a 9X13 pan for 30 mins. For plain, just used 2 cups chocolate chips, I didn't double it because I thought it would be too fudgy. Took 28 - 30 mins. Let the pan cool, before cutting the brownies up.  Overnight, I left them in an airtight container.
I loved the fact that clean up was quick - bowl, whisk and pan. No Kitchen Aid :)"
52262,32204,2007-08-11,5,"Great tasting, easy brownies!  I couldn't believe how little time it took to put together the recipe.  One bowl does it all!  I through in white chocolate chips, semi-sweet chocolate chips, and peanut butter chips.  I didn't measure the chip amounts, but it was probably around 2 1/2 - 3 cups worth.  It was not too much.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
185285,32204,2007-08-21,5,"I did it, I did it!! I made brownies!!! OMG!!!  I have tried soooo many recipes and they always end up hard on the outside and never set in the middle.  THESE were perfect! I just used chocolate chips and for fun, tested out Recipe#89207 for the frosting. I took them to a company BBQ where they were devoured.  Note: Since I struggle with brownies, I alwasys make them a day ahead of time so that they have time to set completely before slicing them. This technique has helped me avoid brownies that won't hold any sort of shape."
173314,32204,2007-09-12,5,"Everyone loved this. Did not use any add ins. Just dusted with some powdered sugar. Very fudge like, like the box types...most by scratch brownies for me have always turned out cake like!  This is the best.  thank you!"
199792,32204,2007-10-05,5,This is an excellent recipe. I can see already that I should have doubled it. I just made the basic brownie with no additions and we loved it. Thanks for this super recipe!
126104,32204,2007-11-04,4,"These were very good.  I followed the directions exactly, and although my toothpick came out dry when I tested, they are still moist.  I only had walnuts on hand, but that's actually what I prefer in my brownies.

A very nice brownie."
359220,32204,2007-11-15,2,"Today is such a sad day for me...I have waited for weeks to try this recipe out for my DH's birthday treat.  We've gotten frustrated with box mixes that seem to get more and more cakey rather than chewy and fudgy, so I was sure this was going to be IT.  Not so, but super easy to stir together, ingredients easy to find and it was by no means a bad tasting brownie- just definitely a more refined chocolate taste and I have to admit I don't have a very refined palate.  Thanks anyway Karen...the hunt continues!"
265954,32204,2008-01-20,5,"Loved these.  I added a 12oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, which I think is PLENTY of chocolate for this recipe and yields a wonderfully moist and chocolately brownie.  I think adding 2 cups of chocolate chips would have been overkill and probably too gooey.  Great recipe.  Thanks for posting."
104295,32204,2008-01-27,5,Yep.  Very easy and super good.  DH made them once before but didn't review.  I made them with marshmallows and they were fudgy and creamy.  Will be used over and over again.
145352,32204,2008-02-05,5,Very good and very easy! My favorite combination!!!
632249,32204,2008-03-07,5,Absolutely great! Thx for sharing.
189616,32204,2008-03-10,5,"Karen, these brownies were wonderful!
The only addition was chopped walnuts. What I consider the Perfect/Ideal brownie."
386849,32204,2008-03-24,4,"A very rich, melt-in-your-mouth, lovely brownie. Much  richer than those from a box- for true chocolate lovers only. Thanks, Karen!"
620763,32204,2008-04-03,5,"Fudgy, moist, and so rich! These are excellent brownies. I baked mine for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  I added chocolate chips and walnuts."
362983,32204,2008-05-04,5,Wow wow wow. These brownies were wonderful! Plus it was so easy to put together. I added chocolate chips and marshmallows so they ended up extra gooey and chocolatey. I was in heaven! They were perfect after exactly 25 minutes and not even a crumb was left when I brought them to a get-together. A friend even said I could live at their place rent free if I made goodies like these for them once a week! Now that says something! Thanks!
100526,32204,2008-05-12,5,"These brownies are delicious. I had to put together a treat for my son's teacher and had a ""girl's night out"". I got home and whipped up a double batch of these in no time. I followed the recipe and added about 3/4 cup to maybe a cup of Chocolate chips in. I didn't measure, it was all I had left in the bag.

They were rich, soft, NOT mushy,  just perfect!

I will definitely be making these again."
400420,32204,2008-05-17,5,"DD made these - they were easy and delicious!  No add ins, but that is the way she likes them!  DD is really the brownie lover in the house, but I will definitely use this recipe, too, and maybe add some mini marshmallows and I also like the cheesecake swirl-in idea!  Thank you!"
497077,32204,2008-05-27,5,"Great Brownies! I added about 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and chopped pecans and DH thought they were great. Fast, easy, delicious! Thank you for a great recipe!!!"
229524,32204,2008-06-07,5,Can see why ever one loves this.  They are so tasty and so easy to make.
121185,32204,2008-06-13,5,Like it even needs another review - but yowza!  These were super tasty!
138429,32204,2008-06-20,5,I made these brownies and they were wonderful. I received great reviews. I added toffee pieces and chocolate chips.  A great recipe. Thanks for sharing.
251626,32204,2008-07-03,5,"These were really great. I added a small amount of mini chocolate chips, butterscotch chips and skor chips. Afer they cooled I cut them and topped them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, choolate sauce, butterscotch sauce and whipped cream...."
808027,32204,2008-08-23,5,"Another happy reviewer...these are wonderful.  My eight year old daughter made these and declared them to be ""AWESOME"".  The best brownies ever!  Moist and full of flavor."
13483,32204,2008-09-03,5,Not much I can really add in the way of a comment.  I served this a one of three deserts at a summer dinner party I had for 20 people.  A number of people commented on them and not one comment was negative.  I simply added some walnuts to this and that was it.  They were great and I thank you for the post.
27643,32204,2008-09-25,0,"I'm very impressed with this recipe! So easy to make. I made them with marshmallows, raisins, and chocolate chips. I took them to a birthday party, and they were a big hit!  Guess I'll be making these again! Thanks!"
47559,32204,2008-09-26,5,"A wonderful and simple recipe to whip up with ingredients I keep on hand.  I added milk chocolate chips, and it was almost too chocolaty and rich.  Next time I'll try a different mix-in.  This is truly a winner recipe."
242484,32204,2008-10-07,5,Perfect brownies in every way!  Super easy & simple ingredients!
172369,32204,2008-10-27,5,A great recipe! Thanks for sharing. I used hersheys dark cocoa and it was fudgy and delicious. I will use this recipe often.
176615,32204,2008-11-07,5,"Excellent! Made the recipe as stated in a foil-lined dish and no add-ins (this time). Used Penzey's natural cocoa with is richer than a grocery store version like Hershey's, and the brownies were SUPER chocolatey! Easy, too.  A pyrex bowl and a fork is all you need. Will definitely make these again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
187281,32204,2008-11-18,5,"Karen, after 500+ five-star reviews you won't be surprised with another one! These are really something special--just perfect.  Moist, tender with a perfect chocolate flavor.  I am going to try these out on my niece and nephew for Thanksgiving.  I know without a doubt that they are going to love them! Thanks! With this recipe, there is absolutely no need to buy a mix or use any other recipe.  Easy and very good!"
377581,32204,2008-12-03,4,Wonderful! This is really easy and quick to make and Delicious. I used pecans. I baked for 30 minutes and they came out great. Thanks so much for posting!
485151,32204,2009-01-21,5,"I've been making these for months now- they are fabulous! I never realized how easy it was to make delicious brownies from scratch! This is the only brownie recipe I use now. I follow the directions exactly, except I triple the recipe and bake them in my large Pampered Chef Bar pan for about 30 minutes. They turn out to be the perfect fudgy brownies, without seeming ""underdone."""
499050,32204,2009-02-16,5,Yum.
50969,32204,2009-03-09,4,"I made these on 3/7/09 for mine and SO's sweet tooth. The recipe was made as written and the ingredient that was added to ""Float Our Boat "" was candy coated Hershey's mini kisses. They were baked for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. After letting them come to room temp.they were cut. My SO really enjoyed them. To me, they were almost too ""gooey"" I could hardly pick them up to eat with my hands.Maybe I'll cook them about 5 to 10 minutes more. Thanks for posting and, ""Keep Smiling :)"""
55729,32204,2009-03-30,4,"These were much easier to make than the recipe I usually use, and very good. I used walnuts. I accidentally undercooked them a bit (exactly 25 min., and they were still a bit wet, rather than just crumbs). I would rather err on that side rather than overcooking, but I might cook them just a bit longer next time."
92886,32204,2009-04-18,4,"Oh wow these were a chocolate explosion!( I added 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips)  If you like ultra moist ,gooey brownies these are just the ticket!  I lined the baking dish with parchment and that worked well for me.  I think I must like my brownies a little more on the cakey side, but for the fudgey, dense brownie lover, these can't be beat."
394077,32204,2009-05-08,3,"I followed recipe exactly but the brownies did not come out as everyone here reviewed. Mine was not  moist or chewy .  It has a weird texture to the crumb.  I baked these at 350 just as the recipe stated.  But in the middle of cooking, there were large bubles in the middle of the pan.  I also think the cocoa flavor is too  strong in this recipe.  Thank you anyway.
Update:  I figure it must be me because everyone here loves this recipe.  So today,  I tried it again.  I am sorry to say it came out the same.  I dont understand it. Big SIGH."
195589,32204,2009-05-11,5,"Like this needs another review! LOL I have made them several times now. The last time,  I added a praline topping from recipe #327160. The praline topping is: 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans or walnuts. Mix them all together and drop by tablespoons or crumble with fingers over the brownie batter. Yummy!!!!! Thanks for posting Karen!"
353131,32204,2009-05-14,5,"Good brownies. But, I think the duncan hines mix is just as good and quicker. But, when I don't have anything else I will definitely fix these again."
92816,32204,2009-05-23,5,"This is the recipe I've always been looking for,a fudgy brownie not cakey.I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly.I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter also.Great recipe!!"
637486,32204,2009-05-25,5,"This was the first time making home-made brownies, and this is a keeper!  I doubled the recipe and added 5 minutes to the baking time.  I also added a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the mix and this was really great.  The brownies were a little flaky and sort of came apart when getting them out of the pan, but other than that, they were awesome!"
768828,32204,2009-05-31,5,These are by far the very best brownies I have ever had.  I added a cup of white chips I needed to use up and a half cup of walnuts.  I had a terrible time not eating the whole pan.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.
64583,32204,2009-06-05,5,"These are fabulous brownies.  The texture is just right - not too fudgy, but not cakey either - and the taste is unbeatable.  For my ""add-ins"" I threw in 1 cup mini marshmallows and 1 cup mini chocolate chips.  This was such a quick recipe to pull together which is a big plus for me!"
126440,32204,2009-06-22,5,"I made these for dessert for Father's Day, I used peppermint extract and green mint chips.  Great Dessert.  DH just loved them."
1122161,32204,2009-07-03,5,"These were so good! I made mine with caramel bits and walnuts. I just LOVE the technique used to make these! No cooking involved, and they come out perfect:) Thanks for posting!"
879716,32204,2009-07-09,5,Awesome brownies!  These were the first brownies I've made from scratch and it was so so easy.   Added peanut butter chips which worked really well to balance the dark richness of the brownies.  I double the recipe to take to a cookout and it made a lot of brownies - especially since I cut them rather small because they are so rich.  The brownies disappeared in our small group.  I agree with another reviewer who said these were better the second day - they were falling to pieces when picked up the night I made them but by the next day they held together perfectly.  Definitely recommend making them a day ahead!  This will be my go-to brownie recipe!  Thanks for posting Karen :)
315055,32204,2009-07-21,5,"This is the best recipe I've ever found for brownies!  I added M&Ms and it was very delicious!  My friend has a ""secret"" recipe that she hasn't been willing to share, and it was the best I had ever had, and I think the may even be THAT recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!"
140806,32204,2009-07-31,4,Pretty great brownie recipe. I mixed M&Ms into mine. They turned out more like fudge and less moist than I had hoped. I can only imagine the endless possibilities for mix-ins! Yum.
355637,32204,2009-11-22,4,These are very tasty! Added peanut butter chips... you can't go wrong with that!
439797,32204,2010-01-30,5,"We're dieting, so I figured out how many calories are in each gram,  I added aboutone cup of chocolate chips and one cup of walnuts.  Doubled the recipe.  4.4 calories per gram."
810787,32204,2010-02-03,4,These were very rich! A little goes a long way. Definitely does wonders for the chocolate tooth.
1506604,32204,2010-03-03,5,These were REALLY good.. Could be a little sweeter but when I was done I felt like a real dessert chef!
1133190,32204,2010-03-13,5,"I feel guilty about these brownies because growing up I LOVED my moms homemade brownies and thought I would never like a homemade brownie recipe better than hers, but I'm afraid I like this one more.  So far when I've made this I've added white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips, which is really good.  I want to try to make  it sometime without any add-ins.  A word of caution, if you like cake-like brownies these are not for you.  Personally I love the chewy, fudge-like brownies so these are perfect!"
15521,32204,2010-06-12,5,"I've been making these for a couple years, and they are pretty much foolproof.  They are definitely my go-to recipe for brownies.  They are perfectly moist and just the right texture.  They never stick around long enough for me to know whether or not they keep well."
203325,32204,2011-01-09,5,These brownies were so easy and oh so good!  I had all of the ingredients on hand. Much better than box brownies.
158086,32204,2010-09-05,5,Such a simple recipe with ingredients you would have on hand and yet they tasted nice and fudgey and yummy....I threw in some white chocolate chips I had on hand...a great fast dessert I served with Moomers Ice Cream for Labor Day.
1052873,32204,2010-12-31,5,Yummy. Kids loved it with mini marshmallows and choc chips. I'm not so crazy about stuff in my brownies but will try it without another time. Maybe I'll try the suggestion for fudge sauce (17309) and poking holes - can't have too much chocolate!
43083,32204,2011-01-11,5,"These were AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! I mixed in almost 2 cups of peanut butter chips. Moist, delicious. I could go on. My 9 yr old (whose birthday was y'day!) said these were the best brownies he ever had! TOOOO easy to make too. Very impressed. Thanks for sharing! WILL make again. The possibilities are endless!"
103876,32204,2011-03-09,5,Here's one more 5-star review for these terrific brownies!  I made them for an after-dance party for my daughter and her friends and every last one was eaten.  We just added milk chocolate chips.  They are very rich and fudgy and a great easy way to make brownies without a box mix.  Thanks for posting!
937635,32204,2011-03-16,5,"Fudge-y good deliciousness! We added some chocolate chips as an afterthought after the batter was poured. Topped with a Bailey's icing for St. Patrick's Day. Wonderful, but you know that already :) Thanks for the keeper!"
350750,32204,2012-02-04,5,Just what I wanted!  Added in chocolate chunks and used oil instead of butter.  Thank you for a tasty quick treat.
2549237,32204,2013-02-14,4,"These are very, very decadent brownies.  We made these with 1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips folded in.  These are simple and only take a few more steps than a box mix to make.  Next time I want to try to do a layer of the brownie batter, a layer of raspberry preserves and then another layer of brownie batter.  There truly are an infinite number of possibilities with this recipe.  Thanks Karen!"
185926,32204,2013-10-02,3,I followed the recipe exactly.  Baked it for about 20 minutes.  I thought it was too sweet and the texture was a little too dense and dry.
13796,32204,2013-11-09,5,Very good recipe! My guests loved them. I used walnuts and chocolate chips (that&#039;s what happened to float my boat today). :-)    I was surprised to see no baking soda or baking powder in the recipe... but continued on with great success. This will be my &#039;go to&#039; brownie recipe from now on. I&#039;ll be sure to line the pan next time because I ruined the first two brownies trying to get them out of the pan. They were gobbled up so quickly that I didn&#039;t get a chance to take a picture.&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE 11/9/2013: Still no picture..   but added 1/2 cup of Skor pieces and they were devoured. I lined the pan with crosswise strips of parchment paper so when they were cool they lifted easily out of the pan and cut nicely.
8629,32204,2014-01-27,2,"These were just ok. They were a very flat brownie.   I have other brownie recipes that I prefer,"
1581225,32204,2015-10-31,5,"I made these to take into work, and they were very popular! I made them with chopped Mars bars. So, so good. Chewy, moist, flavourful and too easy."
489552,37336,2013-11-12,5,"Delicious, and easy."
101823,37336,2005-06-27,4,So easy with a great flavor.  The chicken was very moist even without covering the dish with foil while baking.  Thanks for posting.
124190,37336,2004-02-20,3,"I thought this was pretty good, but a little salty for my taste. Also, neither my husband or son would eat it because it was not very visually appealing. I did use fat free mayo, as the full fat stuff is a bit high in calories for us. I will not make this again, but not because I thought it tasted bad. Unfortunately, I'm just outvoted. It is very fast and easy to prepare, and I only needed 30 minutes bake time. Thanks!"
203111,37336,2005-06-14,5,"5 stars and then some... this was SO GOOD!  Scaled recipe to 1 serving, cut amount of salt by 2/3 and added a bit of Dijon.  Next time will make a little extra sauce just because I couldn't get enough of what was there. LOL.  Thanks for a real keeper, Denise in NH! "
173579,37336,2005-06-16,5,This is a great recipe. Not only is it quick and easy but taste fabulous too.  It is so moist you want believe it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
35526,37336,2005-06-27,5,Perfect easy to make dish.  I threw it together and it was appreciated by all. I used cajun seasoning salt.
51011,37336,2005-07-16,5,I really wasn't sure about the mayo- but you really can't tell it is there!  Super good and easy!  We will have this again soon.  Thanks for sharing!
29782,37336,2005-07-26,5,Good and tasty way for chicken! Love the cheese taste it gives. I have used mayonnaise before to baste chicken. Its a nice tenderizer too. We enjoy this recipe. Thanks for sharing!
229524,37336,2005-12-10,5,"After my husband took his 1st bite he said,'what flavor!"" It's so easy and so good.  Loved the way the chicken was so moist."
136997,37336,2006-02-13,4,"I have to admit that the taste was a bit out of the ordinary for me. I'm not used to eating things with warmed mayo. However, my husband inhaled it. He loved it. It turned out very moist and I did bake it for 45 min., only because the breasts were still partially frozen, so it turned out perfect. :) "
280271,37336,2006-03-05,5,The chicken had a delightful flavor and as promised they did melt in your mouth. I followed the recipe to a T and had no problem browning them. Very easy dish to prepare and took no time at all after a busy day at work. Another keeper in my cookbook. Thanks for posting.
149363,37336,2006-03-09,5,"This is awesome! My whole fmaily loved this, especially my 5 year old. I have never seen her eat so much chicken!
Thanks for a family favourite!"
126104,37336,2006-03-18,5,"I've been making another version of this, minus the garlic and pepper.  I made this version the other nite, and it's delicious.  My SIL's Dad just asked me for the recipe, and I had to search to find it.  It will be a constant for me and them."
222055,37336,2006-03-21,5,"We really enjoyed this and dh made sure he let me know. We didn't get to eat it together so when he stressed how much he liked it, I knew it was a definite keeper! Thank You!!!"
146486,37336,2006-03-28,5,"Oh how scrumptious!  Bake time is right on too as it was perfectly done in 45 minutes. Very moist, tender, delicious chicken that we will be having again!"
232480,37336,2006-04-09,4,"This had excellent flavor and was really very simple to throw together.  Next time I will cut way back on the seasoning salt though if not eliminate it completely, because combined with the parmesan this was way too salty.  Next time I may try miracle whip instead of regular mayo and see how that goes."
74652,37336,2006-04-09,2,I really wanted to like this but the sauce cooked off the chicken while cooking and we were left with plain chicken breasts and a very greasy sauce we tried to spoon over the chicken.  We just didn't care for this one.
58836,37336,2006-05-22,5,Made last night for supper.  Was really good.  Even DH commented and he's not a fan of mayo or baked chicken.  Thanks.
36944,37336,2006-07-25,5,"My DH said that this was the best chicken breast he ever ate, it was moist, and cooked to perfection.
That is really high praise and on top of that it's so simple and easy to do.  I just followed the directions.  Thank you Denise for sharing your delicious recipe!  "
53932,37336,2006-09-03,5,I reduced the amount of mayo but used the full amount of everything else.  Great tasting chicken and it was moist!
68884,37336,2006-10-03,3,"Although this chicken was very, very moist (the juices covered the pan), I found it extremely salty. I used the exact spice measurements, and only increased the black pepper, and this mixture was so salty that I scraped it off. This is easy and with items most cooks have on hand, but I don't think I'll make it again."
203325,37336,2006-11-15,2,We had high hopes for this chicken because of the high ratings.  The chicken was moist but very bland.  The coating of the chicken had a weird consistency and the majority of our family scraped it off.
182624,37336,2007-01-08,4,"Funny thing...my mom had been raving about a chicken-mayo recipe for a few months and she made it over and over. I recalled this the other day and asked her for the recipe.  She said she hadn't made it in awhile and couldn't find the recipe.  I was bummed - especially since my mayo is about to expire and I wanted to use it up.  I decided to see what other chicken recipes I could find, and lo and behold, here it was.  I never even thought to look for it specifically.  Anyway, it was as delicious as I'd heard.  The only change I made was cut the seasoning salt down to 1/2 teaspoon based on a few other reviewers comments, and I didn't find it too salty at all.  My husband commented repeatedly on how good the chicken was and how moist it was.  I baked 45 minutes exactly and it came out perfect.  A real winner!"
187373,37336,2007-04-19,4,"Probably doesn't need another review, but this was such a good, quick and easy recipe to make! Very moist and I loved it, even though I don't like mayonnaise at all! Thanks Denise!"
64642,37336,2007-05-30,4,"We quite liked this.
Based on others' comments and because the combination of mayonnaise and parmesan seemed salty enough, we left out the seasoning salt altogether.  Added a little onion powder to the mixture and baked as directed. The chicken was moist and flavorful."
175824,37336,2007-07-28,5,"I made this for my sister tonight and it was delicious. I used Helmans, and no salt. It truly did nelt in your mouth. My sister asked who's recipe is this. I told her Denise in NH. She said Denise in NH is a good cook. She rated it 5 stars or more."
407007,37336,2007-08-06,4,"this was pretty yummy! I used light miracle whip and other than that followed the directions exactly. I could go with a pinch more flavor though - maybe next time I'll add some chili powder or something for a little kick! all in all, great recipe! will be making again & again. thank you for a keeper!"
174991,37336,2007-11-09,5,Very moist chicken and easy to make.  The only different thing that I did was to cut the mayo to 1/2 cup.
369715,37336,2008-01-28,4,With all the great reviews I had to try this. My one son hates mayo so wasn't sure how this would go over. I made the recipe as directed other then I used 8 boneless thin cut breast cutlets. I kept the rest of the recipe as written other then I only used 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning salt because of what other reviewers had mentioned. Everyone enjoyed these even my mayo hating son (I never did tell him what was in it :) ) Hubby said I can make these again.
447123,37336,2008-02-07,5,Thank you thank you thank you!!! This is a very very good chicken recipe! I read the other reviews and it seems some folks think this is a bit salty so I just used 1tsp. of the seasoning salt. This was super moist and just DARN good. This is a must make!! :) thanks again Denise in NH!! You ROCK!!
218535,37336,2008-02-19,4,This is very tender and yummy. But there is WAY TOO MUCH salt. I'd cut salt down to 1/2 tsp next time.
357358,37336,2008-06-08,5,"Moist, tender and delicious! I did not feel like cooking and this was a great choice. A great way to use up some of those seasoning mixes in a jar! Thanks."
93006,37336,2008-06-26,5,"The most tender, juicy, and flavorful baked chicken breast you'll ever put in your mouth.  Leave in the oven a few extra minutes for ""crustier"" finish.  So easy, packs plenty of flavor - we gobbled it up!"
847160,37336,2008-07-13,5,wow ....ttht was way better that i imagine ... thanks alot  for that god recipe
158086,37336,2008-07-15,5,"This was a wonderful recipe...
Nice and moist and flavorful, I used low fat mayo and it was perfect"
207176,37336,2008-10-06,5,We all really liked this a lot! I would make it again. I used 4 big boneless skinless breasts and just painted the mixture on. I used only half the ingredient amounts and used lowfat mayo and 1/2 tsp. season salt. I added some paprika for color. I was relieved it tasted so nice since it wasn't very pretty. It did brown in the oven though. I served it with roasted red potatoes and green beans. Thanks for a great and super easy dinner!
142335,37336,2008-11-13,5,"I can't believe I haven't rated this. It's easy, tasty and goes with just about any side. I've also used different spices to give it a different flavor. Last night I combined old bay and parm. cheese with the mayo. It's become my ole faithful when I just plain don't know what to have and don't want to think about it :) Thank you for this gem of a recipe."
199792,37336,2008-12-13,5,"This hardly needs another review but it really is as wonderful as the other reviewers say it is. I have had it stored in my chicken cookbook for a long time and tonight we enjoyed it. The chicken is moist, tender and flavourful. It comes out a beautiful brown colour after 45 minutes, company worthy for sure. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe."
358796,37336,2008-12-27,4,"Easy recipe. Cut all ingredients in half & omitted the seasoning salt (don't care for it). Instead used Penzey's Parisian seasonings. Parm made it pretty salty, so I'd reduce that next time."
774665,37336,2009-10-04,5,I can't believe I haven't rated this yet. This is my go to recipe when I am short on groceries and too lazy to shop. It always gets raves from my family and I love it. Thanks.
1072593,37336,2009-04-01,3,"I've made this twice. The first time I thought that I did something wrong after viewing the many wonderful reviews and ratings. Yes, the chicken was very tender, the aroma was just fabulous and the topping truly was delicious. Easy to prepare is an understatment. I could whip this up with one hand tied behind my back. The drawback was that the breasts tasted poached with the seasonings bound in the topping. Having said that, my husband thought it quite savory.  On this one I left the rating totally up to him."
844554,37336,2009-08-21,4,I used 1 big boneless chicken breast and cut the recipe down. I followed it exactly and ours was done in 20 minutes. This was very moist and tasty. Thanks for another entry in the chicken cookbook!
255338,37336,2009-10-25,5,"My daughter is eating this right now and enjoying it immensely. I am so glad I chanced upon this recipe, not only is it so simple to prepare, it is really good to eat.
The only thing I did out of necessity was to use half grated cheddar and half grated parmesan because that was what I had. Baked this in a glass dish at 375 for 35 minutes and 350 for the last 15. Thank you for sharing."
8629,37336,2009-11-15,5,Very good. I flattened out the boneless chicken breast and so it was fully cooked in about 30 minutes.
184723,37336,2010-02-01,5,"I have to update my review because I made this recipe again and it was FABULOUS.  My whole family devoured it and I served it with noodles and a veggie on the side.  The first time I made it I had said the top had a weird consistency because of the mayo but I realized what I did wrong.  I covered it with foil the other time I made it and this time I did not.  I used shredded parmesan instead of grated and it had the perfect slightly crispy consistency...really, it was out of this world.  My husband has requested this as a once-a-week meal!  THANK YOU!!!!!!"
333017,37336,2010-04-29,0,"I am not rating this recipe as I had made quite a bit of changes.  I used 9 chicken thighs....cut the recipe in half...used about 1 tsp of Dijon mustard and sprinkled the chicken with some Panko breadcrumbs..used salt, pepper and a mixed blend of seasonings in place of the salt, pepper and garlic powder.  (I can't use seasoning salt as it has MSG in it)  I cooked the chicken for 35 minutes at 375.  The chicken came out quite moist and flavourful.  This was one of those fast, stupid easy recipe perfect for those those nights where you are in a rush...but would not hold up to snuff for company.  Were I to rate it, I would give it a solid 3-1/2.  There is taste, but the colour is not very appealing!!!  Thanks for posting!"
4470,37336,2010-07-24,0,"Great recipe, neat flavor. I spread the lite mayo on the breasts then sprinkled on the pepper & garlic - I also added a hot & spicy mix.  I held off sprinkling the  cheese on until the breasts were half cooked.  Then sprinkled it on and it was golden when the chicken was cooked  - We enjoyed our dinner thanks"
371738,37336,2010-09-05,3,I had high hopes for this chicken because of the high ratings. The chicken was moist.  For that I am giving it the 3 stars and for the ease of preparation.  It was like warm mayo on bland chicken.  I scraped off the mayo mixture and served it with recipe #43023 to salvage the chicken breasts.
1365025,37336,2010-09-15,4,I changed a few things but not the main ingredient in your recipe. I don't like Parmesan cheese so I didn't use it. I forgot to season the chicken. I spread the mayo on a skinless chicken breast and baked that for half the baking time then I added shredded mozzarella cheese and on top of that I had a layer of finely crushed french fried onion. I finished baking this until the cheese melted and the french fried onions  were nice and brown. Yum! The chicken was moist and really tender.
81611,37336,2011-04-08,4,"Easy recipe. Turned out far too salty for our tastes (and we love salt!), then I realized that the seasoning in my frozen chicken breasts probably contributed to the salt. If you were using unseasoned chicken, it would probably be about right. I will use this again, but instead of cutting down the ingredients, use 6-8 chicken breasts (we also like leftovers!) and use fresh garlic rather than garlic powder."
316717,37336,2011-04-26,5,"Picky husband enjoyed this. He even asked to put it in rotation. So I'm rating this 5 stars on his behalf. I used fresh cheese & found salt to be perfect, I could just imagine the canned prepared ones making this super salty so I'd stick w/ fresh. But even w/ the saltiness of fresh I would probably season & marinate chicken next time since I felt flavor didn't penetrate chicken. Flavor was only where I had bites of the cheese mixture topping."
928301,37336,2012-02-15,5,wonderful.  I love baking chicken!  Just stick it in the oven & do whatever while it cooks without need of constant supervision!
176615,37336,2012-04-14,5,Good! Super easy for a weeknight meal. Moist and flavorful. Even my son who doesn't care for chicken ate and enjoyed. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
198154,37336,2012-05-20,5,"We have both meat eaters and vegetarians in our family.  I used Quorn naked cutlets for the vegetarians and boneless skinless chicken breasts for the meat eaters.  I also used a light mayo.  But other than that followed the recipe.  It was enjoyed by everyone, which is rare in our house.  The chicken took longer than 45 minutes to cook but the breasts were on the larger side.  The Quorn only took 20-25 minutes and I did not defrost the cutlets before baking.  The only thing I may do differently is reduce the amount of seasoned salt next time.  It was just a little on the strong side.  I will be adding this to my cook book for sure. Thanks!!"
768828,37336,2012-07-17,5,"We loved this - my DH who doesn't like mayo said it was damn good.  I thought it would get a little more crispy on the outside, but didn't matter - the flavor was so good.  Like one other reviewer I think there was enough sauce for six pieces of chicken.   We were a little concerned about reheating but this was just as good second time around.  Thanks for a great recipe."
140132,37336,2012-10-27,5,These really are melt in your mouth.  I made these for my family along with noodles and a veggie.....GREAT meal.  Thank you so much for sharing this simple yet delicious recipe with us.  We loved it.
33159,37336,2013-06-11,4,Really good!  I used fat free Greek yogurt instead of mayo.
540346,37336,2013-06-17,5,"Easy and Delicious!  Everyone in my family loved this chicken, including 5 children.  It is often hard to please ALL 5 children!  My son who doesn&#039;t like mayo even liked it---of course, I did not tell him that it was smothered in mayo.  Make it; you won&#039;t be sorry."
529278,37336,2013-07-21,5,"I discovered our mayo was way past date, so I ended up using miracle whip.  I think I got it too thick because it didn&#039;t make the &quot;crust&quot; like it was supposed to.  But we just didn&#039;t eat the excess sauce and it was good.  It did taste &quot;miracle whippy&quot; but I like that flavor, so it was fine.  I would think with mayo, the seasonings used would come through more.   I ate the leftovers a couple of days later and it was still moist.  My 6 and 8 year olds gobbled it up and I was able to bribe my 2 year old to eat it, so that makes this recipe a winner :). Five stars especially because of how easy this was.  I don&#039;t like to touch chicken, so I used 6 of the schwans unbreaded chicken breast fillets.  Mixing the ingredients up was super quick.  In fact it took me longer to look for new mayo than to do the rest of the prep!"
191533,37336,2013-10-03,4,"Good- and easy, too."
125640,177558,2006-08-01,4,"Didn't notice any significant difference in taste, but this is definately the easiest method I've ever tried for making corn. Thanks a lot."
169969,177558,2006-08-11,5,This was by far the easiest way to roast corn yet. I loved how the silk just peeled off with the husk! The corn really retained its flavor and was delicious. The time was right on for our ears. Thank you Pot Pie!!
178742,177558,2006-08-22,5,"I may have rated this already! From the grocery bag to the oven, that's all you do! It is one of our favorites, and it is the only way we make corn on the cob! I too saw it on Tyler Florence's ""Food 911"" about 2 years ago. And the chili lime butter slathered all over just kicks it up another notch! "
89831,177558,2006-08-23,5,"I roast many other veggies, why not corn! the flavor in the corn is so much sweeter done this way, try this everyone! great method PotPie! thanks for sharing...Kitten:) "
180090,177558,2006-08-24,5,This is the easiest way I've ever made corn and it turned out perfect! I baked 4 ears of corn for about 25 minutes and it was the perfect tenderness and so good that I didn't need salt and butter. Thanks for posting this!
182624,177558,2006-08-25,5,"I don't know if it was the cooking method or just really great corn, but this rocked my world!  I'll never make it on the grill again, and I've had many compliments on my grilled corn.  It's especially great if you're grilling your entire meal (like we frequently do) and don't have enough space for everything.  Also great that you don't have to keep checking it to make sure it's done - just pop it in the oven and forget about it.  Genius!"
227607,177558,2006-09-02,5,This was awesome and so easy.  I just stuck them in the oven.  After 30 minutes they came out and the husks peeled right off and under neath was the sweetest crisp corn I have ever had.  I did not even put butter or anything on it.
53932,177558,2006-09-03,5,Incredibly easy and tasty.  I wish I had known about this method of cooking long ago as the corn tastes wonderful.
140806,177558,2006-09-05,5,"This is a great no-muss no-fuss method for preparing corn, esp for people like me who don't own a grill.  The corn almost fell away from the cob. It was so moist and tasty, I can't imagine I'll make corn any other way again."
33159,177558,2006-09-07,5,"What a ridiculously easy way to prepare corn on the cob!!  I don't think it tasted any better than boiling but it looked WAY better - the kernels stayed nice & plump.  And, for some reason, the silk came off a lot easier after roasting than it normally does before boiling."
248023,177558,2007-05-10,4,"The corn turned out really juicy, but the taste was about the same as if I had boiled the ears.  However, it was sooooo easy just to rinse off the ears and put them in the oven when I already had the entree cooking so I didn't have to turn on another burner and bother with all that hot water and another pot to clean.  After they were done ( about 25 min ) I put them on a plate and stuck them in the microwave while I got the rest of the dinner ready.  They were still warm and ready for the butter 15 min later... That was great... no soggy, watery corn! Thanks!"
329638,177558,2007-08-30,5,"This is amazing, and it couldn't be easier!  I just rinsed, tossed in the oven, and in 30 minutes had some of the sweetest, juciest corn ever.  The husks and silks peeled right off- no more scrubbing and rinsing to get all those little bits of silk off.  This was awesome, thanks so much for posting!"
185285,177558,2007-11-29,5,"So Easy and So Tasty!! Why would I go through the hassle of grilling again? Honestly, this is my new recipe. Thanks!"
666723,177558,2008-01-01,4,"I used this method so I could cut off the corn and use it in a chicken pot pie.  I'm glad I was going to use it for another recipe because the corn was not cooked all the way through even after 30 minutes.  The taste was good, just a little too crunchy."
37449,177558,2008-06-25,5,Thank you for an easy recipe that has such good results! Yum!
386849,177558,2008-07-14,5,What a great way to prepare corn! I love it!
333017,177558,2008-07-18,5,I have done this for years....but on the grill!  Can't beat an easy way to serve corn.  The only downfall is that you have to let the cobs cool off somewhat as they retain their heat and it is a little hot on the hands!
377581,177558,2008-07-20,5,"Wonderful!! What a great way to cook corn! I've made this recipe several times, always with terrific results. This is very easy to make, and delicious. Thank you so much for posting! This recipe is a keeper for sure."
39301,177558,2008-08-30,5,"This worked beautifully.  Will definitely be making my corn on the cob like this more often!  UPDATE: Forget ""more often"", this is the ONLY way we do corn on the cob now.  Boiled corn tastes so blah compared to this method!!  Thanks again for posting!"
497077,177558,2008-08-31,5,"Best corn on the cob I've ever made-and it doesn't get any easier! I cooked 3 ears for 30 minutes but had to hold them in the warm oven about 15 minutes w/o a problem. Served w/ my sloppy joes and apple salad for a delicious, easy meal. Thank you so much for posting a great recipe!!! UPDATE: I just wanted to add that we have had corn 4 times in the last 2 weeks-that's how much we love this recipe! Our corn have been huge so the 30 minutes cooking time still keeps the corn w/ a little crunch which we love-for smaller, I would only cook for 20 minutes! Thank you again Laurel!!!"
844554,177558,2008-09-06,5,This definitely makes shucking the corn alot easier. A nice change from boiling the corn. Will make again.
37636,177558,2008-09-29,5,"This was just WONDERFUL- another simple, no-fuss, easy way to make perfect roasted corn. Just toss it into the oven and it cooks perfectly. Easy to pull back the husk, butter and serve. What's not to like??? Thanks for sharing. ~Sue"
185446,177558,2008-10-09,5,"For those occasions when you can make an entire meal in the oven (and that's often), this is a wonderful idea.  What a convenience to pop everything in there at once.  Thanks, Chef PotPie, for such a simple, yet very good corn on the cob suggestion!"
189475,177558,2009-04-27,5,Excellent idea. It's way easier than boiling the corn. This will be my new way of making corn on the cob from now on. Thanks!
879716,177558,2009-05-07,5,"This method makes awesome corn.  Before putting in the oven, I pull back the husks and remove the silky strings - they come off easily.  Sometimes I sprinkle a little salt or other seasonings on the corn before covering back up with the husk and tossing in the oven.  I need to make this again soon!  :)"
286851,177558,2009-06-26,5,"Worked great. I didn't notice a big difference in flavor, however the corn was very tender and juicy. Very easy to make. Thanks for sharing."
470351,177558,2009-07-11,5,This recipe has blown away all my previous favorite methods of making corn on the cob....and simple too!  My go-to recipe for corn on the cob now.  Must try!
579298,177558,2009-07-17,5,This is insane goodness!! Why did people make preparing corn on the cob so complicated?! LOVE THIS METHOD!
140132,177558,2009-07-30,5,This is worth all 5 stars + 100 more!  No more standing in front of the garbage can cleaning corn! Yea!  No more boiling the corn getting a steam facial! Yea!  This corn turned out so tender and cooked to perfection.  I cooked it exactly the 30 minutes and it was perfect.  I also stacked the corn ears on top of each other.  I had a dozen ears and they all didn't fit on the bottom so I put 3 ears on top of the others and it worked perfectly.  Thank you so much for showing me this really easy and so much better way of preparing corn.
486718,177558,2009-10-05,5,Very easy and came out perfectly!! This is the only way I will make corn on the cob.  Thanks!!
176615,177558,2010-05-16,5,Really simple method which produces perfect corn. Made this along with recipe #8701 and Recipe #14023 for a wonderful meal. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
132383,177558,2010-05-18,5,I guess my dinner guests loved this because I didn't even get one!  Several were still talking about it the next day.  Next time I'll make more than 1 per.  Thanks for posting!
26512,177558,2010-07-08,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I always grill my corn, but thought I would give this a try. Couldn't be easier, tastes just like it came off the gas grill. Love it, will make again."
1179225,177558,2011-07-07,5,Wow...perfect and so easy! Our's needed to stay in the oven about 5 extra minutes. Thanks for posting.
131021,177558,2012-04-23,5,So good and so easy. I couldn't ask for a better recipe. I hate peeling the silks and this is so much easier. We will make it this way again and again. YUM!
198154,177558,2012-06-11,5,5 stars for the easiest way to make corn on the cob!  WooHoo!
350750,177558,2014-07-20,5,"Great technique for cooking corn.  We enjoyed it and the amazing thing was no prep work was involved, also the silk wasn&#039;t a pain to get out either.  Thank you!"
8629,177558,2014-10-05,5,This worked out very well. It is the only way I cook fresh corn on the cob.
39835,64934,2004-08-20,5,"Delicious and what a great ""fun"" type of supper! Didn't change a thing and everyone enjoyed having corn dogs at home. Thanks for sharing this keeper!"
32058,66703,2003-07-18,5,These were great.  Tastes like bakery quality and each one came out perfect at 12 minutes.  (I allow them to cool on the pan completely before removing onto plates).  I used regular shortening and creamy Jif PB.  Next time I'd like to try it w/ crunchy PB
103876,66703,2005-08-06,5,These are definitely the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.  Search no further for the perfect recipe - this is it!  They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a great flavor.  This will be a repeat for special occasions.  Thanks for sharing this outstanding recipe!
97579,66703,2005-08-22,5,THESE ARE AWESOME!  I'm not even done baking them and I can't keep my hands off them!!  I will definately be making this my #1 peanut butter cookie recipe!  Thanks!
64583,66703,2005-10-07,5,My friend recommended this recipe to me and I'm so glad that she did.  These cookies are a huge hit with my family!  They're the perfect texture and taste.
37305,66703,2005-11-18,5,"What can I add?...just fabulous cookies!  Perfect crispy outside, chewy on the inside. Mine took 11 minutes and I got aobut 4 dozen cookies. "
89831,66703,2006-02-04,4,"These cookies were good but definately not the best, I really think that the large amount shortening took away lots of flavor from the cookie. I might try these using half butter and half shortening next time. Thanks, Kittencal:)"
173579,66703,2006-05-01,5,Great cookies! Some of the best that I have ever eaten.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
402559,66703,2007-01-07,5,"This is one of the best I have made, used butter though. Thanks!"
316717,66703,2007-02-02,5,"my husband gives this 5 stars. i cooked mine for 12 minutes and it turned out slightly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. i followed the recipe to the ""T"" except i did half vegetable shortening since that's all i had and half unsalted butter. tastes great. this is my first peanut butter cookie since i'm not a fan of them and only cooked this mainly cuz my husband LOVES peanut butter cookies and he said it's the ""perfect"" peanut butter cookies. he said it's not too sweet and just perfect. a very picky man that hubby of mine so if he really loves this then A+. thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. will definately make again.
o by the way....i used only half of the dough because i've already made 3 dozen w/ the other half and didn't want to make too much. recipe makes a ton of cookies...but it's ok..we'll definately eat it all. =)"
180090,66703,2007-04-23,5,"I brought these cookies to school and everyone loved them. Be sure not to overbake them so they stay softer. They tasted great warm out of the oven, and on the 2nd day they were very good as well, but they hardened up a little bit, but still had a little softeness. The flavor is wonderful and I highly recommend these cookies!! YUM :P"
47559,66703,2007-04-24,5,"Excellent.  Crispy on the outside, and chewy inside.  Just the right amount of peanutbutter flavor."
394077,66703,2007-07-10,4,These are good. The only thing I did different was I skipped the rolling in the sugar. The extra sugar made them too sweet for my taste.  UPDATE: These cookies get hard the next day. They are the best coming out of the oven.
158086,66703,2007-08-16,5,What a great cookie recipe this turned out to be...I thought I had a good one until I tried this one...Sending these out in a box to my son who lives in Florida as he misses homemade goodies...these will travel well...thanks
58836,66703,2007-09-14,5,"Made these this morning to take to work.  I think I should have baked a touch longer but they are very good.  I used butter, next time I will use crisco.  I want them to look like the picture (fuller) and mine didn't, they are flat.  Didn't make a difference on the taste.  Only thing I did different was I added macadamin nuts to part of the batter.  YUMMY.  I'm sure I'll make again."
307214,66703,2007-10-14,4,"Very good but a little too sweet but still a great taste.  I used margarine instead of Crisco (didn't have).  Also added an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  Next time I would skip the rolling in sugar.  We made closer to 5 dozen ""large"" cookies."
386849,66703,2007-10-15,5,My mom made these for us and they were great!  Thanks!
222055,66703,2007-11-21,4,These went over pretty good at my pre-holiday Thanksgiving party. I didn't roll in sugar and I still think they were just alittle too sweet. Thank you LiisaN!
400420,66703,2008-01-12,5,"We love these cookies!  I made them last week and they went pretty fast.  Today DH said that I needed to make them again, so when DD said she was going to make cookies, I asked her to make these.  I have to tell you that my dog LOVES them, too :-D  We can't eat one with out her staring us down, wanting a bite!  Thanks for such a yummy cookie!"
92816,66703,2008-03-22,5,"These are so good.Chewy on the inside and crispy outside.That makes a perfect cookie in my books.I loved the sugary coating,it did not make the cookies too sweet at all.It's a wonder these even made it to the cookie stage,the dough itself was delicious!"
218535,66703,2008-09-29,4,"This is very similar to Recipe #10269. The only difference is that this uses crisco and the other recipe uses butter. Personally, I prefer butter. Try Recipe #10269 and decide for yourself."
185446,66703,2009-04-20,5,"These sure do remind me of peanut blossom cookies--you know, the ones that have a Hershey's Kiss squished into the center?! Same consistency and crackly texture, although I like the stronger peanut butter flavor of these more. Not quite a traditional peanut butter cookie, nor a blossom cookie, but still very, very yummy. Kudos to Big Grandma--let's hope Little Grandma furnished cherished family recipes too."
142559,66703,2009-06-04,5,"These are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had/made! So easy and they came out perfectly - much better than the ""fork"" top type!! I followed the recipe exactly and they were so yummy!!! Thanks for sharing! Update: I made these again using crunchy peanut butter - Oh. My. Gawd.  I did not think these could have ever been improved upon. I was dead wrong! The crunch peanut butter is fantastic!!!!"
620763,66703,2009-09-03,5,I love these cookies! I baked mine for 12 minutes and they were crunchy on the outside edges and chewy in the middle. I refrigerated my dough for about 10 minutes before rolling  the cookies into balls because the dough was very soft. After a few minutes in the fridge it was perfect.
140132,66703,2011-03-07,5,These really do melt in your mouth.  I made mine a bit small so I got about 4 1/2 dozen.  We loved these cookies.  Thank you for sharing these easy cookies that take no time at all to whip up.
191533,66703,2011-04-21,5,"Wow, this recipe deserves every 5-star review it's gotten!! We used 1/2   butter, 1/2 Crisco like many others did. Also skipped rolling the dough in sugar- didn't miss it! These do have wonderful texture and peanut butter taste!"
312577,66703,2012-03-25,5,I tried these peanut butter cookies in place of my usual and I am sure glad I tried them.  I love the big puffy look and the taste is perfect.  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.
98919,66703,2012-08-09,5,"This will be my go-to peanut butter cookie from now on!!  Very easy, especially if the grandkids get involved on the rolling!  I didn't have Butter Crisco so I made it the way my mom used do when I was a kid.  She would do 1/2 margarine (not the spread kind but a good brand in the stick form) and 1/2 Crisco.  We doubled this recipe and we have dough coming out our ears.  Thought I would freeze some but doubt they make it there, they are so good.  Making a note that my review will be number 248 just to see how far this recipe goes years from now.  Thanks for posting!!  Sooo good!!"
368078,66703,2013-09-07,5,"Yep, another 5 star review.  They&#039;re that good, and I love a soft PB recipe!  I followed the instructions exactly, except I halved the recipe (which was super easy to do).  I used regular crisco, instead of butter flavored and crunchy PB.  They turned out amazing!"
60992,77397,2004-01-02,5,"So tasty and easy! I baked this in 2 round 8"" pans instead of the 13x9. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and generous dash of nutmeg to the batter. The smells coming from my oven brought everyone to the kitchen. When I served this the cake was moist and light, the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture had oozed to everypart of the cake. It was breakfast nirvana!"
149363,77397,2005-07-24,5,"This was so awesome! I made it exactly as written, and topped it with chopped walnuts and it turned out fantastic. I served it to a group of hungry overnight guests, and it got rave reviews.
Well written and easy to follow recipe, it's a real crowd pleaser.
Thanks for a keeper!"
98919,77397,2006-02-04,5,"My first impression of this recipe, reminded me of a wonderful childhood memory. When I tasted it warm out of the oven I thought of when my mom used to take the leftover scraps of dough from making a pie crust and bake it with cinnamon/sugar and butter.  My grandkids loved this and it is so easy to make.  Thanks for sharing Kittencal!"
140806,77397,2006-02-16,5,This recipe was by no means a flop! It is more like a flip because that is what everyone does when they taste this! It could not have been easier to whip up. It was devoured before it even had a chance to cool down. Is great for dessert and would be great for breakfast too. Thanks for the fantastic recipe! Yum!
230557,77397,2006-02-23,4,"I made this using 1/2 & 1/2 and adding 1t vanilla to the batter.  It is very thick but I didn't find it hard to spread.  Easy to make and baked up nice - lvoe the topping, thought the cake could be a little sweeter."
168462,77397,2006-02-24,5,"My family loved this so much that they asked me to make a second batch as soon as they tried it. I made this exactly as written and would not change a thing. I made up a simple icing of icing sugar, vanilla, milk and butter for the kids to spread on top of their pieces. Thanks for such a great recipe."
199020,77397,2006-03-24,4,"This was certainly a quick, easy breakfast recipe.  I think if I made it again, I would add the egg for a more cake-like texture, as it was sort of rubbery without it."
58836,77397,2006-02-24,5,"I am always making something and taking to work and this morning I thought I'd do something.  Well, so I didn't have a lot of time by the time I decided to bake a dish.  Found this and I'm so glad I did.  It was quick and easy and delicious.  Got rave reviews.  I'm sure I'll make again.  Thanks."
64583,77397,2006-02-25,4,"We liked this, but found that it had a sort of spongy texture that we didn't love.  But it sure smelled heavenly while it was baking, and the topping tasted great.  "
121185,77397,2006-03-01,4,"This was sooooo easy and really good  - I felt like it needed a bit ""more"" than just cinnamon - perhaps some nutmeg?  I did add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter (as well as 3 in the topping) and I'm glad I did.  I also added one egg and 2 tsp. vanilla.  I subbed 1/2 whole wheat and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also used fat free half-n-half. Topping it with #120835 made it even better.  I did make a mistake and combined ALL the topping inged. together (even the butter) and I ended up having to smear it over the top - but it was still great!"
232480,77397,2006-03-04,4,"This was good.  I followed the directions exactly, leaving out the egg.  With all the baking powder in it, it still rose quite a bit.  It was good but I think next time I make it I might add cinnamon to the batter or swirl the topping through the batter - something.  I think I'd add some vanilla as well to the batter.  All in all, though, a very basic coffee cake type recipe that will please a lot of people!"
278113,77397,2006-03-05,5,"Really yummy, and super easy! My 13 year old son made this for us, and we all loved it. He did add a bit of nutmeg, and 1 tsp of vanilla. Thanks for a great treat!!"
175824,77397,2006-03-09,5,"Wow was this good and easy. I took this to work and one of my co workers asked what is the highest rating. I said 5 stars. She said then it's 5 stars. I used half n half, about 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. I also put about 1/2 cup of walnuts on top. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. I will be making this again and again."
126104,77397,2006-03-21,3,"Very quick.  I had all the ingredients, and it was a nice change from bacon and eggs."
47559,77397,2006-04-09,4,Very easy and tasty.
103876,77397,2006-04-23,5,"This turned out great!  I used an 11X7 pan which made it nice and thick.  I also substituted half Splenda for the white sugar, used part fat-free half and half and part skim milk and used only 3T margarine.  I add a few chopped pecans to the top and when finished also added a glaze of powdered sugar, almond extract and milk.  The texture was a cross between a cinnamon roll and a coffee cake.  I will definitely make again."
255338,77397,2006-05-08,4,"A gem of a recipe, and so simple to make. Thank you Kittencal."
135887,77397,2006-05-12,4,"Really good.  I will try it with the egg next time because using a 9x13 made the ""cake"" have a few holes.  Or, maybe use a smaller pan but I don't really want to buy a special pan.  Anyway, I used glaze recipe #120835 using almond extract and it was excellent."
91392,77397,2006-05-14,5,"Very easy, very good.  I added an egg and some almond extract, then sliced almonds on the top.  Even made with half whole wheat flour, and half Splenda, it ws still good.  Anyone would like this!"
142367,77397,2006-05-21,4,This is a good and quick recipe -- my 14 year old son made it with ease.  I'm adding it to my breakfast keeper file.  Thanks for sharing!
124249,77397,2006-05-31,5,"I have seen this reviewed so many times I thought I would give it a try. This made a nice coffeecake. I added the egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla and chopped walnuts. I topped with your glaze recipe #120835.

Thanks Kittencal.

Bullwinkle"
147109,77397,2006-06-01,4,"I tried this with the egg and vanilla and it was very good, but not fantastic.  I will be trying it again soon without the egg and vanilla to give it a true review!  Thanks!"
76951,77397,2006-06-14,5,"Mine came out very light and moist.  I did add 1 egg and a tsp of vanilla and did not over mix.  I also drizzled  Kittencal's glaze over the top using Half & Half instead of whipping cream. I took it to a work carry-in and received a lot of compliments and requests for the recipe.  It is so simple AND good that I'm considering replacing my usual Christmas coffeecake with this one.  No - I WILL do that.  Thanks, Kittencal, another winner!"
104295,77397,2006-06-15,5,"There is a reason this has over 100 reviews!  I used whole wheat pastry flour and fat free half and half.  For the melted butter I used some of that stuff that comes in a spray bottle.  It all tasted great and had the texture we enjoy.  Thanks for another great one, Kittencal!"
97579,77397,2006-06-25,5,"This was our morning treat today and was gobbled up by all!  I used your creamy white glaze recipe and it was perfect.  I cooked for a full 25 minutes and in my oven I think it was a tad bit to long, so next time I will go with the 20 minutes. I will definately be making it again.  Thanks! "
64203,77397,2006-07-03,5,This recipe was soooo good! I can't believe how easy it was to put together! My entire brood of in-laws were in town this weekend and I served this for breakfast and every single female asked for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly without adding anything additional and it was delicious. I did top it with a sugar glaze which was the perfect touch. Thanks KC for sharing this recipe.
229850,77397,2006-07-11,5,"Made this, loved it! Sooo easy, next time I want to try the glaze I did use pecans in it though, we really enjoyed it, and I soo enjoyed how fast it was to make. Thanx for posting."
88099,77397,2006-07-14,5,OMG this is so easy to prepare and tasted just wonderful.  I used your glaze to top this off.  The girls at work will love this.  Thanks for another winner Kitz
56087,77397,2006-07-23,5,"Something so simple and easy shouldn't be this good.  I did add an egg and used half milk/half-n-half.  Added sliced almonds to the top.  Hubby said ""We should have CAKE for breakfast everyday""."
68960,77397,2006-08-27,5,This is very easy to through together.  I prepared exactally as the recipe was written.  Added a handful of sultana's to the topping. Served warm with icecream. Thank you Kittencal for another winner!
92816,77397,2006-09-27,4,"These were ok,not quite as good as the real cinnamon buns.It's just a cinnamon cake.It's ok if you want something sweet and fast."
146486,77397,2006-10-04,5,"So delicious!  This makes such a light, fluffy cake and I love how easy it is.  I used skim milk and doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  I also added an egg although I may try it without next time.  Thanks for this yummy treat!"
187281,77397,2006-12-03,5,Excellent!
280166,77397,2006-12-13,5,"Successfully halved the recipe and baked in an 8X8 pan with the egg, vanilla and nutmeg as suggested by other reviewers.  Wish I had some pecans to sprinkle on! Outstanding dessert/breakfast!"
222433,77397,2006-12-17,5,So easy and all ingredients are in the pantry. What could be better...oh wait...having your family think that your the bomb!! Thanks Kitten!
125640,77397,2006-12-27,4,"This was an easy, tasty cake that took very little time to prepare. For health reasons and because we're not big on super sweet stuff anyway, I cut back a little on the sugar to 2/3 cup (1/3 cup splenda + 1/3 cup sugar) in the dough and 1/3 cup brown sugar on top with the full 2 tsp cinnamon. I also added a tsp of vanilla, a dash of nutmeg. I've tried it both with 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and without nuts and it's good both ways. The first time I made this I was concerned 'cause the dough was thick and sticky so it was hard to spread in the pan, but it puffed out to fill the space. It also didn't seem like there was enough butter on top the first time as some spots were a little dry, so I used 7 tbsp and that was better the second time. I've also tried it both with and without the egg and it changes the texture but both ways are good. It's fluffier and more cake like with the egg and denser and more roll like without it. All in all, I'd say it's a good and easy basic cinnamon roll/coffee cake type recipe. Definately worth a try."
182624,77397,2007-01-08,4,"You can't get any easier than this!  I made exactly as directed w/o the addition of an egg.  I was skeptical - but curious - as to how it would turn out, but pleasantly surprised.  Great recipe."
177933,77397,2007-01-10,5,Wonderful!  I ate it hot out of the oven yesterday and I'm having more this morning.  Thanks!
52125,77397,2007-01-14,5,"We flipped over this flop! I followed your recipe exactly, but adding one teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. I did not add a egg to the batter, and we all loved it very much! My DS ate two pieces and wanted more. My DH said, ""that dog will hunt"" , which means it's really awesome! Thank goodness for this flop the next morning, since we were out of power in the house, it went great with instant coffee, lol....Thanks again KITTENCAL....This is a Keeper...."
172369,77397,2007-01-21,5,"Yummy, I made as directed with pecans on top, It was a snowy day and a few of my sons friinds came in and the next thing I know this cake was gone. I did get a small peice! I just may be making this every weekend, what an easy and delicious coffee cake. Thanks Kitten, I can always count on you!"
52543,77397,2007-01-28,5,"Its hard to embellish on the other 178 reviews ........ this was very easy, very good, very sweet! A little too sweet for me but hubby (Mr. Sweet Tooth) loved it. I made half the recipe in an 8"" round pan (20 minutes was perfect), added nutmeg, vanilla & raisins - then drizzled with your glaze which added to the sweetness. The next time, I'll cut back on the sugar OR skip the glaze. Thanx Carol!"
140132,77397,2007-01-30,4,This is a good recipe.  I made this on Sunday for our brunch.  We enjoyed this very much. I didn't add any glaze and we didn't miss it at all. Very good sweet treat........thank you   Stephanie
447123,77397,2007-07-24,5,"I dont' think there is another recipee that is so easy but so so delicious~!!! WE loved it!! Quick, tasty, easy is my kind of recipe!!a++++++++++++++++++++++++"
80998,77397,2007-08-27,5,"Can I give it more than five stars.  Kittencal, your recipes never cease to amaze me.  I followed the recipe exact except I double the topping (cause we love brown sugar and cinnamon).  it was amazing.  i am on a diet so I only had a small bite, but dear hubby went back for seconds and told me this was the best dessert ever.  Thanks for a gret one.  Used it with your glaze recipe.  Outstanding."
251917,77397,2007-09-05,5,Delicious - we made this over the long holiday weekend and enjoyed it for 2 breakfasts!! Delicious and easy to make - my 4 yr old loved helping me make it!
248023,77397,2007-09-06,3,"I guess we are in the minority here... we liked this easy treat but it was nothing spectacular... I followed the instructions exactly as written, used milk instead of half and half, added the optional egg, 2 tsp of the optional vanilla, and the max amount of cinnamon.  I really tried not to overmix, and spread it out into a 13x9 pan and sprinkled chopped pecans on top.  I baked for 20 min and it smelled heavenly.  I did make Recipe #120835 to drizzle on top...  I would have liked more of the topping, since some of the cake seemed to have bare spots... Maybe I am not familiar with what the texture should have been, but mine seemed a little crumbly and dry... I guess I was expecting a more moist cake... but with barely any fat in the batter, I assume not!  It did taste really good... but I just didn't like the texture... maybe it's just a personal thing!  We had it warm, drizzled with the glaze and topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream for dessert. A quick and easy brunch option or a quick fix if you've got a craving for something cinnamon-y... Thanks for posting Kitten!"
158086,77397,2007-10-17,5,"This was a great, fast dessert recipe....I used a 9 X 13 pan and had no problems....I also used splenda for baking and it turned out perfect."
377581,77397,2008-01-10,3,This was very quick and easy to make. I enjoyed it warm with a cup of coffee. Really liked the topping! Thank You!
189616,77397,2008-01-11,5,"I made this as written, using the optional egg. Quick, easy and delicious!"
39301,77397,2008-01-20,5,A simple and tasty breakfast treat.  Thanks for sharing. I always split the batter between 2 8-inch rounds and put pecans on one.  For some reason the one without the nuts cooks faster.  Don't know why.  Your creamy white glaze is perfect with this.
383346,77397,2008-01-20,5,"Yummy!  I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup.  It's enough for us.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla.  I added 1 cup of blueberries thawed to the dough.  For the topping, I used only 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Thanks Kit :) Made for Zaar Star Game."
176615,77397,2008-01-21,5,"Yummy! and so much easier than cinnamon rolls in the morning :) Made as directed, including recipe #120835 and the family loved it. The icing was delicious, but would certainly be good without it, too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
400708,77397,2008-02-17,5,"Kittencal you've done it again.  This was so easy and wonderful.  Thanks to you my DH thinks I'm wonderful.  This was so easy, had it in the oven in just a matter of minutes and served warm for a special breakfast.  Had the taste of fresh cinnamon buns without the work.  Glad I followed your advice and used the large pan as it rose wonderful and the bigger pan was needed.  I also topped it with chopped walnuts, added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and used your recipe #120835 to top.  It was way to much for just the two of us (though we could have eaten it all) so sliced into individual servings and froze.  When I took them out of the freezer, let them come to room temp. and they were just as good as when first made.  Love these and will be making them a lot from now on."
187373,77397,2008-03-22,5,"Not that this needs another review, but, YUM, this was really good.  I did use the egg and used skim milk. The cake was very moist and delicious!  Give 4 stars for taste and the fifth for how easy it is to make with ingredients I always have on hand!"
222564,77397,2008-04-03,5,"All five stars for easy preparation of cinnamon bun type of cakey thing, lovely!"
377039,77397,2008-04-21,5,"Made exactly as described, with egg, without nuts. This was good but just TOO sweet for myself and my fiance. However, he took it to work with him and it was demolished; he asked that I do make it again for special occasions.  I made Kittencal's Easy Creamy White Glaze to top. Very good! I'll make this again, but as a dessert rather than a breakfast.

Update -- after being requested by the people my husband works with SEVERAL times to make this again (and again, and again), I have to revise to FIVE wonderful stars -- even if it IS still too sweet for me!"
218535,77397,2008-04-21,4,I did use eggs in mine and no nuts. It is good but I think it'd be better if I added nuts and use a glaze as suggested by other reviewers.
173579,77397,2009-02-22,5,Great tasting recipe.  So easy to throw together.  Very nice cinnamon flavor.  Thanks for such a tasty treat.
37636,77397,2008-05-01,5,"This was GREAT! It tased like the old-fashioned coffee cakes I remember as a child! VERY easy to prepare, and QUICK! I enjoyed this warm from the oven with coffee for breakfast. I dodn't use the optional creamy white glaze as this tasted fabulous on it's enough with just enough sweetness. Thanks Kitten! And come back home and to Zaar asap because we need you here among your zaar friends. (((hug)))"
8688,77397,2008-05-09,5,"This was by no means a ""Flop"" at my house! What wonderful flavor! So simple to prepare :) The aroma that filled my house brought everyone to the kitchen to find out what was in the oven! Kittencal, you know I will be making this one again!! Thanks so much for the wonderful breakfast recipe! -- posted Sept 11, 2005 *** Just an update to let you know this recipe remains a favorite in my house! I love to add in an egg for great texture, the almond extract, a few sliced almonds on top and Kittencal's recipe for Really Easy and Good Creamy White Glaze Recipe #120835 at a pourable consistency to top off the Flop : )"
847160,77397,2008-07-26,4,that was a good cake
59163,77397,2008-07-28,5,"Have wanted to make this for quite a while, and did just that yesterday.  Served it along with a breakfast casserole.  It was so quick and easy to make with such wonderful resutls.  Added chopped pecans on the top which really make it even better.
Highly recommended for overnight guests."
789516,77397,2008-09-07,5,delicious!
226863,77397,2008-10-06,5,"This was really good. My son loved it. I added the white glaze as suggested. It made it a little too sweet for me, so next time I may decrease the sugar in the cake so that I can still use the tastey glaze. I made this for I Recommend Tag Game. Thanks for the recipe!"
142559,77397,2008-10-07,5,"This was excellent! Threw it together this morning to take to work and added the glaze too.  It was devoured! I topped with sliced almonds.  Mine didn't rise very much, but that could be because my baking powder is old. Will be making again - very fast and very good!"
1072593,77397,2008-12-17,3,"I've been eyeing this recipe for years and tis the season for baking... Firstly, I mixed dry ingredients then added this to the wet ingredients as suggested, using a light hand. After baking, it was apparent the butter along with the brown sugar, sunk towards the bottom making it rather gooey. Now, don't get me wrong, this may be a good thing for many. I also made half a recipe of Kittencal's Easy Creamy White Glaze, which was more than enough. I'm uncertain if the flop's richness is a result of using half-and-half and egg or the addition of the glaze, but the combination was almost over-the-top sweet."
620763,77397,2009-01-28,5,So simple and delicious! I halved recipe and baked in an 8 x 8 pan. I used the creamy white glaze on top. Fantastic!!! Will definitely be making again.
894666,77397,2009-02-27,5,"So good, so easy! Skipped the egg, subbed lite plain soymilk for milk and used Splenda instead of sugar for cake part. (Boyfriend doesn't have my sweettooth). A great alternative to cinnamon rolls for the time-crunched."
1122161,77397,2009-04-12,5,This was absolutely the best coffee cake! Everyone loved it! I made as directed using the glaze suggested. Thanks so much for posting!
470351,77397,2009-05-01,5,DEFINITE 5 stars from me!  Made this for my son's 5th birthday breakfast yesterday and we all LOVED it!  I chose this recipe because I am a TERRIBLE baker and I don't have much time in the morning with two little ones to whip up anything elaborate.  This was both quick and easy!  Win-win for me!  I even screwed up the last part and melted the butter and mixed it with the brown sugar and cinnamon and still the flavor was heavenly.  My husband and mom both ate some leftovers today and still declared it a winner!  Thanks for a great one Kitten!
350750,77397,2009-08-02,5,I made this for my husband who wanted cinnamon rolls and it did the trick.  I loved how easy it was to make.  Thanks!
329638,77397,2009-08-10,4,"Made this the other day with the boys.  It was fast, had it mixed and in the pan before the oven had preheated, and had a good flavor.  The boys devoured it, though I thought it was a bit too sweet for me.  Great, quick, and easy.  Thanks!"
15521,77397,2009-09-22,4,"This was easy and good.  I made a 9 x 13 cake but didn't take time to make a glaze.  Next time I would. The texture is different - kind of spongy.  I think my personal preference is for something a little more crumbly, but if you like a spongy textured cake, this is a great one.  I thought the cinnamon and brown sugar topping improved the next day."
632249,77397,2009-12-07,4,I thought this cake was okay. It was certainly easy to prepare but the texture was strange for me so I don't think I would make it again. Thanks anyways.
482376,77397,2009-12-27,5,"Adding another 5 star review for this delight! I made this as an extra gift to give to my mom at Christmas, because she loves cinnamon buns/cake. This was super simple to put together and I had all of the ingredients on hand. How wonderful is that?! I used 2 8-inch tins (disposable kind for ease of gift giving) - and the batter filled them both up beautifully. What I think is really cool about this recipe, is that the brown sugar/cinnamon topping kind of seeps down into the cake as it bakes up. I didn't do the glaze but next time I will. It looks fabulous! ~Made for KK's Forum~"
540346,77397,2010-01-23,5,"This was so easy and delicious.  I cut the amount of sugar in half, using less than 3/4 c white sugar and only 1/4 c brown sugar.  It was still plenty sweet.  I drizzled a simple powdered sugar glaze on top.  Almost the whole thing was gone and there are only 5 of us!  Update:  I made this with whole wheat flour and also halved the butter and it was just as delicious.  My husband actually preferred it that way."
810787,77397,2010-06-19,3,I had really high hopes for this because of so many wonderful reviews. It was just okay to me. It actually tasted too sweet and I only used 1 cup of sugar. The texture was off for me as well.
1179225,77397,2011-03-20,4,Very good! I think it was better the next day. Next time I'll toast the walnuts. So easy and quick. Perfect snack cake.Thanks for posting!
529278,77397,2011-05-11,4,"The kids loved this ""breakfast cake.""  I put some whipped cream on top for them.  This took me significantly longer than 5 minutes (which I blame on myself, not Kittencal).  I used almond extract because I love the smell of almond extract, but I think I'd like the taste better with vanilla.  I will do this again.  It'll go over well with house guests."
203111,77397,2011-07-24,2,"When this turns out right, it's great.  But the last time I made it, not changing a thing, it had the texture of a wet sponge...tough, diificult to cut, not very appealing.  I probably won't make it again because I need recipes I can rely on and this one is too unpredictable.   But thanks anyway."
1052873,77397,2011-09-02,5,Very tasty. Doesn't look anything like the picture. The topping ended up in the middle. I used 2 eggs because the hens just started laying and they were on the small side. Too much egg. Also took 15 minutes to throw together. Started at 5:10 and had to leave for work at 5:55. Ended up a little late!
43083,77397,2011-12-19,4,I made this for a work breakfast buffet this morning. Super easy to make! The topping was very tasty:)
489552,77397,2013-09-21,5,"Like the title say&#039;s 5 minutes.  This was good.  I did add more cinnamon to mine because what I did after mixing cake was take about 3/4 cup of the batter and added cinnamon to it, I then added that to the rest of cake batter and swirled it around using a fork.  Came out beautiful.  You must add the icing, it really gives it that cinnamon roll affect.  I can&#039;t wait to try it with Jam n Fruits.&lt;br/&gt;I just want to add that since I made this recipe two weeks ago, my 5 yr old Grandson has asked me to make it twice.  I made it 2 days ago and my Grandson did all the mixing after I measured out all the ingredients.  Fun for kids in the kitchen and good above all :)"
242484,77397,2014-01-20,5,OMG!  Why did I wait so long to finally try this amazing recipe!!  LUV IT!
2549237,77397,2014-03-25,4,"This was a super simple and rather good &quot;coffee&quot; like cake.  It was subtly sweet and the topping was quite delicious.  I feel that in making this in the 13 x 9-inch pan the topping could have really been doubled.  This is something that I could whip up quickly for unexpected guests, so this is definitely  keeper.  Thanks Kittencalskitchen!"
1581225,77397,2016-11-24,5,"Very yummy, quick and easy cake. My kids devoured it (I chose not to add nuts). Next time I might try the round pans instead of the 13x9, for ease of serving and storage."
52125,26217,2002-11-19,5,What a wonderful spaghetti sauce! It's full of flavor. Thanks Bev.
32772,26217,2003-09-30,5,"Simple, Easy, and Taste Great! What more can you ask for. Prepared it the night before and placed it in the liner of my crockpot. All I had to do is take it out of the refrig and cook it on low for 8 hours. Served it with garlic fettucine, Three Cheese Texas Toast and side salad. "
176615,26217,2005-02-13,5,"I knew this would be wonderful, so I made a double batch and froze a good bit to enjoy later. Oh, it smelled good while it was simmering on the stove! The only change I made was to use 2 lbs of extra lean ground beef in my double batch. Adding the mushrooms at the end was delicious, one of those, ""I can't believe I never thought to do this"" moments. A wonderful recipe as well because it used ingredients I had on hand. The whole family loved it! Thanks, Bev, for a fabulous recipe!"
68884,26217,2005-02-27,4,"I doubled everything, and as it simmered & I tasted, I felt it was a bit bland & added three additional cloves of roasted garlic, a few shakes of red pepper & a pinch of sugar. I made 2 large pans of lasagna with the sauce & have enough leftover in the freezer for probably 4 servings of spaghetti -- so glad I doubled it (use a BIG stockpot if you do). I really like the blend of the different types of tomato products. Thanks Bev!"
137911,26217,2005-04-16,4,"A good basic sauce, but found it was just missing something. I felt it just needed something to bring it above just a tomato flavor.  I put more garlic in it and a bit of sugar and that seemed to help.  I think using 1/2 italian sausage would added flavor too."
52543,26217,2006-01-10,5,"This delicious spaghetti sauce is very similar to my own recipe! Personally, I don't like the flavour of sausages in spaghetti sauce (nor the fat) but I used up 1/2 lb leftover lean ground pork with a lb of ground beef. My sauce was Sharon 123's Basic Basil Tomato Sauce (#74421) which I canned last summer & may have increased the basil flavour slightly. I also added a cup of dry red wine & simmered, uncovered, for 3 hours to produce a thick sauce full of flavour. I added the mushrooms during the last hour. Thanx Bev!"
158086,26217,2006-05-21,5,This was a fabulous spaghetti sauce recipe. I added 1/2 cup red wine and a couple teaspoons of splendra..and let it simmer slow on stove all day...was wonderful...
91392,26217,2006-06-11,5,"Easy and economical.  I also added some extra garlic, a bit of sugar as the tomatoes were a bit bitter for our taste and a splash of red wine.  Makes a lot, but I'm certain will be even better leftover.  A very good basic meat sauce.  I did sauté and add the mushrooms to the sauce too.  I'm seriously thinking of just dipping good bread in it and forgetting the spaghetti."
37779,26217,2006-08-14,4,I thought this was a good basic sauce that uses ingredients I usually have in my pantry. Ease of preparation is also a bonus. I do think the flavor could be upped a bit by using 1/2 lb. Italian sausage. I missed the flavor of fennel which I get from the sausage. Thanks for giving us something new to try.
142464,26217,2007-02-08,4,"Had this for my supper tonight and found it really good.  As DH doesn't care for spaghetti I have plenty to freeze for another time.  Followed instructions to a ""t"" and turned out perfect.  Thanks Bev."
394077,26217,2007-03-25,4,Very easy and very good sauce.  I added 2 Tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of dill.  Everything else was exact to the recipe.  Delish.
55578,26217,2007-09-13,5,"Great recipe Bev!  I did not put in the mushrooms, but I did simmer it in my crock pot.  MMMmm, a nice rich flavor!"
184723,26217,2007-10-10,5,This sauce was wonderful!  My whole family enjoyed it.  Not only was it simple... but very flavorful. Thanks for posting and will make again!
168462,26217,2008-02-29,5,"This is an excellent sauce. I did reduce the oregano and basil and leave out the bay leaves, but otherwise made as directed. Thanks for the recipe."
248023,26217,2008-07-25,5,We loved this hearty and meaty spaghetti sauce...  Very easy to prepare and throw together on a lazy afternoon.  I was short one can of tomato sauce so I subbed in another can of tomatoes.  I used whole tomatoes instead of the diced and loved the texture since I crushed them slightly by hand.  Fresh tasting and absolutely delicious!  Not overly cooked like some sauces can be...  The hardest part was keeping my BF from dipping into it as it simmered.  We added in the sauteed mushrooms and would not have it any other way!  Thanks for a keeper!!!
789516,26217,2008-08-08,5,"This was great.  I used lean veal instead of beef, just for a change, and I think I like it better that way.  A mixture of both would be good also."
240552,26217,2008-09-16,5,"Great sauce! I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, Mrs. Dash's Italian seasoning, and added 2 T. sugar to the sauce.  Thank you so much for sharing, Bev!!"
222433,26217,2008-09-23,4,"OMG! The mushrooms on top are fabulous! I used hamburger this time, but I would love to try italian sausage. Defintely going into the make again file. Thanks Bev!"
218535,26217,2008-09-29,3,This tastes a tad sour to me. Maybe it's my tomato paste and tomato sauce?
497077,26217,2008-10-18,5,"DELICIOUS!!! I made this sauce exactly as written except I simmered homemade meatballs, instead of browning the ground beef, with excellent results. I included mushrooms and topped w/ parmesan. Made enough to freeze half. Thank you so much, Bev, for a great recipe!!!"
103876,26217,2008-10-19,0,"This is really delicious and easy sauce!  Instead of the ground beef, I added a package of pre-cooked turkey meatballs and simmered them along with the sauce.  It was all very flavorful and not a lot of effort.  I'm sure I will make this again.  Thanks for posting!"
847160,26217,2008-10-24,4,ok
37868,26217,2009-01-12,5,This is a 5 STAR All the way!! I used Diced Tomatoes. However one was Pettie Diced and the other was Diced. I think everything turned out wonderful. I do not think anything can mess up this recipe. So very easy to do and fast to put together. Great Recipe!! Thank You and Hugs 2 U.
529278,26217,2009-02-17,3,"Good, basic sauce.  Easy to make, not very spicy, but not bland.  Skipped the mushrooms."
359220,26217,2009-03-22,4,"Wow!  This recipe makes a lot of sauce!  I made the full recipe-worth and figured we'd have it over pasta tonight and with lasagna later this week.  Surprise- we had DH's parents over last minute and somehow I still have enough for our second meal!  I love the cook once, eat twice benefit of this recipe.  Very hearty and tasty, will use again."
126104,26217,2009-05-25,5,"This was a yummy recipe. I was craving spaghetti sauce, and not the bottled variety. I love Bev's recipes, so I knew this one would be delicious. It was. I made a few changes, but I ALWAYS add a little brown sugar to every spaghetti sauce recipe. I added a tiny bit more garlic and oregano, because I always like those a little heavier. I had a bad can of tomato sauce, and left out one of those, and even with that, it came out really well. The next time, I'll check my expiration dates before I begin. Bev, thanks for an easy and quick(er) sauce than mine, and one that doesn't make way too much for one person. This is a keeper."
389431,26217,2009-08-14,5,"I had never made homemade spaghetti sauce before tonight and I can honestly say... I won't be going back to Ragu!
Even my spaghetti hating husband commented on how much he loved this!
Thank you so very much!!"
140132,26217,2009-09-27,4,this is very good.  I could make this and just dip bread into it.....so good.  Thank you for sharing.
532289,26217,2009-11-11,5,"Delicious, easy, and quick.  I will make this often.  Thanks for sharing."
969481,26217,2009-11-25,5,I chose this recipe to make for my birthday dinner. My guests loved it and everyone had seconds. Would not change a thing (ok.. maybe just 1 more clove of garlic!)
180090,26217,2009-11-29,5,"Great recipe! I used ground turkey and it was delicious! Made a lot of sauce, so we froze the extra for later. Thank you Bev!"
189475,26217,2009-12-07,5,"This was so good! I only use 1 lb ground beef when I make it, and there still seems to be plenty of meat in it. I always add extra garlic and seasonings, and usually leave out the mushrooms. I've made this several times already and I usually freeze the leftover sauce. It freezes so well that next time I might double the recipe (using 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb sausage) so I have more to freeze.  I've never had a better meat sauce; thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!"
774665,26217,2009-12-22,5,"I have to admit I didn't think this sauce was going to be as great as everybody says--but boy did you prove me wrong. This is just what I've been looking for. It's a very fresh tasting sauce with just the right amount of herbs. My son, who never eats sauce, ate a ton of this one. Thank you Bev!"
175824,26217,2010-01-10,5,"What a wonderful sauce.
Added a little more garlic and doubled the recipe. Had to use a giant stock pot. Froze half of it. It was even better the next day. Thanks Bev for sharing such a great recipe!!"
53932,26217,2010-02-25,5,"Excellent spaghetti sauce.  I didn't have enough time to simmer it the full time on the first day, but simmered it longer before serving the next day and it was so delicious."
187373,26217,2011-06-24,4,"This recipe was pretty good with modifications.  I made meatballs, so didn't use the ground beef.  I added zucchini and carrots which I sauteed with garlic and onion, then used my immersion blender to hide the veggies from my husband!  ;)   I simmered for an hour, then put in the meatballs to cook for another hour.  I did have to add more herbs and garlic powder and I added a splash of red wine.  This made a TON--I served 4 last night and have another 2 full bowls as leftovers that I plan to put in the freezer.  Thanks for posting."
383346,26217,2011-07-08,4,I added the mushrooms in the sauce at the beginning.  Next time I'll add more veggies to give more taste.  It was too tomato taste.  Maybe a little bit of sugar would help.  Tonight I used it in recipe#289942 and it was great.  So maybe only a little bit of red wine added to it would add flavor.  Thanks Bev :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
88099,26217,2013-07-27,5,This was a great sauce.    Thanks for sharing.
1365025,26217,2013-11-14,5,Wonderful sauce! This made a lot of spaghetti sauce for 1 person so I canned a lot of it. I will add the mushrooms and Parmesan cheese when I use it.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup.
173314,26217,2014-01-12,0,Excellent sauce. Usexd onion powder and garlic powder- did not use mushrooms. Great taste and will use this recipe!
894666,26217,2016-01-19,5,"This is so delicious, I literally start it in the morning and let it simmer all day, kids keep coming in the kitchen to see what smells so good. I find we have a couple cups of sauce left after dinner so the next day I simmer the leftover with some whip cream and siracha and I can stretch out the leftovers to a second meal, it makes a nice spicy sauce. I should add I add a generous splash of white wine and a sprinkle of crush red pepper when I make your recipe. Keep sneaking &quot;tastes&quot; while simmering, as my mom said growing up, &quot;Baker&#039;s privilege!&quot;"
383346,251917,2011-07-22,4,This is a good recipe.  But we found that it tasted too much of the balsamic vinegar.  I used fresh basil that I added at the end.  I think it would be better tasting with fresh tomatoes.  Thanks Babzy :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
13796,118761,2005-04-24,5,"It took me a third try to get this cooked the way I like it. The first one that cooked for one minute was hard. The second one cooked for 45 seconds was too sloppy and under done for me. The third try worked like a charm. I have a 1,000 watt microwave and cooked the egg for 53 seconds. Next time I think I can cook it for 50 seconds and then just let rest in the water for a few seconds longer to continue cooking it gently. This is SOOOO much faster and much easier cleanup compared to cooking in a saucepan. Although I love poached eggs, I've never liked the mess of poaching eggs, so I started cooking soft boiled eggs... but even then I couldn't get the timing just right or they broke when I attempted to get the shell off. This is THE way to go for me from now on. Thanks PaulaG!"
35526,118761,2005-05-27,5,Perfect.  Here's how I adapted to be able to do these at work.  No vinegar.  I took a coffee cup and put the water and the eggs in it.  I popped the yolks just to be safe and then microwaved them for one minute.  I drained the water off really well and added a small amount of butter and enjoyed them so much.  Thank you so much for a healthy solution to the breakfast at work problem.
169969,118761,2005-06-26,5,I almost feel like writing a press release so the world knows how to poach eggs like this!!! Poached Eggs are my all time favorite!!! This was so easy and so fast!! I will never use another method!!! Thank you!!!!
42720,118761,2005-06-28,5,"I could not believe how easy this was to make!  And to think I've been making soft boiled eggs all these years because I was so intimidated by the ""old fashioned"" way to make poached ones. Oh boy!  I love this new trick!  Thanks Paula!! :)"
95743,118761,2005-07-15,5,It works. I used a paper towel rather than plastic wrap.
124249,118761,2005-07-27,5,"This was a quick and easy way to make a poached egg. Only had to cook mine for 45 seconds.
Only had one casuality. Guess I didn't pierce the yolk good enough.

Thanks PaulaG.

104295,118761,2005-07-28,5,After a moderately intense morning workout this was a fast burst of protein (as I was out of my usual hard boiled eggs).  I needed 1 mine 10 seconds to cook 2 and I left off the plastic wrap with no problems.  I also used smaller ramekins (4 oz) and I was worried but it worked just fine.  Thanks Paula!
52125,118761,2006-06-10,5,"Thanks so much for posting this recipe as I never could poach an egg, until now. I poached my egg for 53 seconds and it turned out perfect and tasted great. Thanks again PaulaG...."
187281,118761,2006-06-12,5,"Excellent! My husband loves poached eggs but I could never do them.  So, now I pop the biscuits in the oven, cook some hashbrowns while their baking and then pop the eggs in the microwave for 53 seconds.  A hot breakfast with no cold eggs!"
160974,118761,2006-10-17,5,"I was taken by the perfect egg photo and immediately made it for my husband. I think the shape/size of the dish makes a difference in the cooking and appearance of the egg. I first did it in a ribbed custard cup that was probably about 4 ounces and egg overcooked and had a squished shape. Next I put it in a small bowl and the shape turned out better and egg was slightly runny the way my DH likes them. I did cook it for around 50 seconds.  I think this is a neat way to cook an egg and I'll try it again. The previous tips from reviewers were helpful.

UPDATE: I cooked in a larger glass Pyrex bowl type for 55 seconds and it turned out perfectly!

74652,118761,2006-12-20,3,I love the idea of this but I'm going to have to give it another try.  The yolk was way to hard for my taste.  I will keep trying though as I can see its worked for others.
182624,118761,2007-01-10,5,"Good eggs! I have to really watch my microwave or they'll really splatter, even with the saran wrap over it.  That's probably just my microwave though.  A fast and easy way to make eggs!  UPDATE:  HA!  You know you've been on zaar far too long when you find a recipe, make it, go to review it and you've already been there, done that!  Last time I gave this four stars, but I don't know what I was thinking.  This is definitely a 5-star recipe!  Easy and the time was spot-on for my microwave (a different one from the last time I made this).  Turned out exactly the same as the stove-top method."
58836,118761,2007-02-11,5,Had this for breakfast this morning.  Turned out perfect.  I'm sure I will have again.  Thanks!
68960,118761,2007-03-27,4,The method worked really well.  I love my eggs cooked in a dash of white vinegar and enjoyed my quick and easy breakfast very much this morning. Will be a handy recipe for our caravan. Thanks Paula.
149363,118761,2007-03-29,5,"Excellent and super fast. This is perfect for us for those on the go days where we find ourselves rushed with no time.
Breakfast is on the table in less than 2 minutes.
Thanks for a terrific and fast breakfast Paula!"
146486,118761,2007-04-16,5,Great recipe!  Hubby has been eating eggs like crazy so I gave him this recipe to try.  Very easy with great results.  Thanks Paula!
88099,118761,2007-05-22,5,Had this for a quick late night dinner.  Cooked it for 50 seconds and it turned out perfect for me.  The yolk was slightly runny.  Served this on wheat toast.  Wonderful method to make a quick poached egg.  Love it.
362983,118761,2007-07-19,5,"This is brilliant! This was the fastest egg I've ever made. No hassle or mess, just quick and easy poached eggs. I only put mine in for about 45 seconds and gave it a few seconds after to continue cooking, though I might even put it in for less next time since my microwave is pretty powerful. I put this on an English muffin with a little butter and salsa and had a great healthy breakfast! This is a new favourite! Thanks!"
68460,118761,2007-08-26,5,My husband and I loved these eggs!  We did ours for the full minute and they were just perfect.  I really liked how quickly we had breakfast on the table this morning.  Thanks for posting this Paula :)
400420,118761,2007-11-20,5,"We're doing some minor kitchen remodeling so I've been living without my stove for a week.  DD is sick and wanted basted eggs and toast, so I thought I'd try this.  It did take me 3 tries to get the eggs to the consistancy we like - whites cooked thru and yokes runny - and still wasn't perfect, but good enough.  I had to cook for about 1 min 40 secs. I may try this at work too! Thanks so much for posting!"
461834,118761,2008-02-08,4,"I loved the simplicity and quick clean-up for these poached eggs.  I followed the directions as written and after one minute of cooking, my egg looked like it was cooked perfectly.  When I removed it with a slotted spoon, to a piece of toast I noticed the bottom was still uncooked,  so I put it back into the water and flipped it over and cooked it 15 more seconds.  The egg was cooked all the way, but the egg yolk was completely hard (I like the yolk to still be somewhat runny).  I next time I will flip the egg after 30 seconds and see if that works in my microwave.  Thanks Paula for a great recipe."
8688,118761,2008-05-30,5,"These are indeed, the Perfect Poached Eggs!  I made as directed, covering ""loosely"" with plastic wrap and poking the yoke with a toothpick.  Midway through the cooking time I heard a loud ""POP"" and a ""Squeal"" (which turned out to be me) and I looked into the microwave and discovered my poached egg had popped out of the  6 oz custard cup onto the microwave dish!  Completely fully cooked to perfection, I was able to save my egg and enjoy with a sprinkling of salt and pepper!! Thanks, Paula, for a very entertaining breakfast this morning!"
140132,118761,2008-06-25,5,"I have never tried poaching eggs before because I wasn't sure I would get it right.  I tried this recipe and it was simple and the eggs were superior.  I'm so glad I tried, I plan on using this method when the kids go back to school for quick morning breakfasts.  Thank you for introducing me to something new."
132383,118761,2008-06-28,5,"When my husband saw this coming out of the microwave, he said ""ewww...I don't want to eat that.""  BUT, he really liked it.  I'm looking for easy things to do at work since I am pregnant and trying to eat better at the office.  Thanks for posting!"
497077,118761,2008-07-30,5,It doesn't get any easier than this! I took the suggestions of others and I cooked my eggs for 45 seconds and let set for 5 seconds because I like the whites set and the yolks runny. I love poached eggs on a spinach salad and I've been using Tarragon Wine Vinegar instead of white vinegar w/ great results-delicious! Thank you for a great recipe!!!
470351,118761,2008-08-04,5,"These turned out wonderful!!!  I haven't had poached eggs since I was a child when my mom used to make these in some huge metal contraption.  I loved the taste but would never go through the work in the morning for them since mornings are so busy!  I have made these 2 days in a row.  The first time I followed the recipe to the letter and had a teeny explosion (which was contained in the saran wrap).  Today, I forgot to pierce the yolk and cooked it for 54 seconds.  I let it sit in the water for another 15 seconds while I got toast ready.  PERFECT!!  DELICOUS!!  EASY!!!  NO MESS!!  Will make these again and again!  Thank you for posting this one!!  Makes mornings a lot better and a lot healthier!  No butter or oil to saute' in...no time to make.  WIN-WIN for me!"
400708,118761,2008-08-12,5,"Well you sure do not need another 5 star rating but I HAVE to put mine in. My DH has recenlty taken a job in Milan, Italy and the apt supplied does not have much of a kitchen. Breakfast has mostly been crossonts (sp) or cold cereal. This really came to the rescue and we BOTH thank you for posting. It was so easy and very good, I do have to work on the timing but think I got it with the second one. We placed on buttered toast, topped with fresh parmasain cheese and hot coffee. What a great and easy recipe. Thanks so much for posting."
40961,118761,2008-11-14,5,Easy and delicious. It  only took 35 seconds in my microwave. Thanks. :)
369715,118761,2008-12-01,5,I love poached eggs but never made them for myself. My daddy always made them when I was younger but they seemed like they were time consuming to make. This method is so quick and easy. I had to adjust the time for my microwave. The first egg I cooked for 50 seconds and that was a bit much so I cut it to 40 seconds and that worked. I followed the recipe as written other then I didn't add the vinegar. Now I can poached eggs when I want them! Thanks Paula!
76951,118761,2008-12-31,5,This is the ONLY way to make poached eggs!  I don't use the vinegar nor the plastic wrap.  I only fill a coffee mug 2/3 full and microwave for 55 seconds.
185926,118761,2009-11-15,5,"WOW!  Fast, easy, tasty and no mess.  That's a five stars.  Thank you."
185446,118761,2010-03-02,5,I'm embarrassed to say I've never eaten a poached egg-- they just seem too runny.  This recipe and luvmybge's timing tips have changed that viewpoint.  Thanks so much.
74281,118761,2010-03-24,5,"I have NEVER been able to make poached eggs, until now. Being on a low carb diet I love eggs for breakfast and now I can have a beautifully poached egg in 52 seconds. I don't use the vinegar and just cover the bowl with a saucer. I did make a mistake and try to make a second egg in the same water as the first. Not a good idea because the water is already hot so it just boiled over. But now I just dump out the water and add new and it works perfectly. I have now used this recipe every day for 2 weeks. Thanks PaulaG! I'm off to explore your other recipes!"
203111,118761,2010-06-04,5,"Just tried this and I am so impressed!  How easy and good it is.  I did mine in a sauce bowl, used the water but no vinegar, and covered the bowl with a coffee filter.  Cooked 1 min. and it was perfect.  I don't own a slotted spoon, so I just poured the water off the egg while keeping the egg in with a spoon.  Love this!"
305531,118761,2011-01-12,5,These were so easy to make and very good. It took about 54 seconds in my microwave to set the white but keep the yolk runny - just the way I like them. Thanks Paula for another keeper. Made for I Recommend Tag.
653438,118761,2011-01-24,5,What a fabulous recipe!  I made corn beef hash yesterday and DH loves poached (runny yolk eggs) on his.  This was fast and really no sticky clean-up.  It takes about 55-57 seconds in our micro but ohhhh soooo easy.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.
55578,118761,2011-06-16,5,Yum
482376,118761,2011-09-03,5,"Perfect poached egg with no fuss!! I'm so impressed. I will be doing this often, whenever I want eggs with toast. It's so easy and quick. The results are perfect. Make sure to follow the directions and prick the yolk with a toothpick and then cover loosely with plastic wrap. My egg was done in about 50-55 seconds. Yum!"
226863,118761,2011-09-04,5,"I'm going to try this again. Today, I cooked for 1 minute, and the egg white wasn't formed at all, still floating in strands in the water.  So I added 30 seconds, and then my yolk was cooked solid.  So I will try a minute and 10 seconds, and maybe and 3 seconds at a time.  I didn't take a pic, because I didn't feel the results were optimum.  I think this is a great idea and I will try it again.  Thanks for sharing!"
74652,76930,2003-12-08,5,Amazing! I love sesame noodles and these are the best! I made it with the chicken but I will eat the cold noodles without! I would give this recipe more stars if I could!
101034,76930,2003-12-15,5,"This was a WOW meal. That's all my DH kept saying. WOW this is good, WOW what a great taste. We both thought it was incredible, it was just so so GOOD!!! Thanks for sharing such a delightful recipe with us."
60260,76930,2003-12-18,4,Great dish!  The noodles are wonderful. We ate them heated.  My chicken was still a bit frozen while I was marinating it so I don't think the meat got the full flavor - I'll make sure I've fully thawed the meat next time before I marinate it.  It will be made again and I'm thinking you could stir fry some veggies along with the chicken strips and add it right into the dish - tasty!
93006,76930,2003-12-26,4,The noodles make this dish!  Very tasty.
60992,76930,2004-01-03,5,"I have made this fantastic dish twice now. The first time exactly to directions. And I think next time I will follow leeannrs advice and put the sesame oil IN the marinade, as I wasn't thrilled with cooking in it. I also think I will cut the chicken into thin strips before marinating as the chicken was a bit dry by the time it was cooked....tasted incredible, but dry. The second time I made it I did it with baby scallops. I also threw some finely shredded carrot into the sesame noodles. Fantastic. Next time maybe some finely chopped cilantro for garnish! This is a fantastic recipe NO matter which way you do it. Thanks Mirj for sharing it with us!"
59473,76930,2004-01-12,4,Made this last night and it was delicious. I used reduced sodium soya sauce.I especially loved the noodles. I will probably make them on their own as a side dish. Thanks Mirj
38643,76930,2004-01-04,4,We loved the chicken but the noodles were only given an ok rating by my family.  Like others I thought the sesame oil was a bit too much.
37449,76930,2004-01-07,5,"I picked this for the chef of the day game and so glad I did! I did cut back  on the sesame oil, and served the chicken seperately. I cooked veggies on the side(mushroom, carrot,celery,zucchini, broccoli and onion). I used some of the marinade for the vegetables. Thanks Mirj for a wonderful dish that my whole family liked!"
29014,76930,2004-01-11,5,"Excellent and easy!  I assumed the sesame seeds should be toasted so I did that first.  Cut the chicken into strips for marinating and reduced the sesame oil by half (just for our personal taste).  I also cooked the chicken in olive oil.  The noodles were delicious - Mark went back for seconds -  an unusual event!  This will become a staple at our house - good enough for company, too!
Thanks, Mirj!"
59780,76930,2004-01-14,5,Yummy! I really liked the flavour in this dish. I used recipe 61198 for the Teriyaki Sauce and I also used dark soy sauce. I really like to do Once a Month Cooking and I think next time I will freeze the chicken in the marinade to cut out that step. That way all I have to do is pull the chicken the night before and it can marinade all day as it defrosts!) Thanks for sharing this recipe.
101823,76930,2004-02-08,5,"OK...so add my hubby and I to the list of Funky Chicken devotees.  We really liked this dish.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I cut the amount of sesame oil in half for the noodles.  I also didn't decide to make this until late in the afternoon, and therefore, cut my chicken breasts into strips before marinating (to allow more surface area to absorb the flavor).  We preferred the noodles warm and I added about 1 1/2 cups of thawed frozen peas to the mix.  Hubby thought that steamed broccoli or other stir-fry veggies would be a good addition, too.  I had to stop hubby after his second bowl; I wanted leftovers for my lunch this week!"
52543,76930,2004-02-11,0,You can please some of the people some of the time - you can please all of the people some of the time - but you'll never please all of the people all of the time and so it is with this dish! You either like the noodles or you don't - its all a matter of taste. We didn't like the noodles BUT we loved the chicken! I'll use that part of the recipe again in a standard veggie stir fry. Thanx Mirj!
55729,76930,2004-02-15,4,"The timetable of this recipe is a bit off for my schedule, so I was nervous about making it. I put the chicken in the marinade before work. The plan was to make the noodles and then the chicken, even though I hated to not let the noodles sit the recommended time. Due to an accident, I ended up at home, so I did make the noodles about 3 hours before dinner. I didn't change anything except to add extra onions so I could use up the whole bunch. Everyone seemed to love it, and ate quite a bit, but I was asked to serve the noodles hot next time. I also only made 12 oz. noodles (the first 12 oz. pkg. I've seen in a long time!) but the sauce would have also covered 16 oz. I think I shall halve it & only cook 8 oz. next time, to serve 4 - I felt the chicken was already perfect for 4 servings."
76951,76930,2004-03-08,5,This was fantastic!  What can I add that hasn't already been said befoe?  I sliced the chicken breasts while half frozen then marinated them.  Definately a keeper.
91392,76930,2004-03-15,5,"Glad I read all of the comments, even though it took awhile.  I dramatically decreased the amount of sesame oil, especially after opening the bottle I bought and getting a whiff of how strong it was!  Used angel hair pasta, and replaced a lot of the oil and some of the soy sauce, just to cut down on the sodium a bit, with chicken stock. I stir fried the chicken, which I sliced up first, then marinated, in Pam, instead of more sesame oil.  I put the sesame oil in the sauce, an in the chicken to marinate, but not more than a TBL.  I was fantastic, and I can't wait to eat the leftovers!"
4470,76930,2004-04-03,5,"Reading over the reviews it appears that people either loved the recipe or were not too fond of it  Well I loved the whole recipe . I cut the recipe back to two servings - no problem.   I did as suggested, cut back on the Sesame oil for the spaghetti ,  used black sesame seeds, and Splenda in stead of sugar. I had chicken thighs (boneless) on hand so used them instead of breasts.  I warmed thepasta to just above room temp before serving  and had the chicken hot  with steamed asparagus on the side.  Thanks Mirjam for a great recipe - yep we inhaled it!."
133174,76930,2004-09-19,5,"Had dinner guests and served this wonderful dish.  We know understand about the ""inhale"" part.  I did toast the seasame seeds before using and used turbinado sugar in the noodles.  Used angel hair pasta for the spaghettini.  Used about 2 times the amount of scallions (personal taste) and a reduced sodium soy sauce.  Because I love ginger, I used a little more than the recipe called for and the chicken was sliced before putting in the marinade.  Also, I served the noodles at room temperature and they absorbed the sauce nicely.  This was a hit with everyone.  Thanks for sharing."
149363,76930,2004-10-04,5,"Hi Mirj, My family LOVED this recipe!I served it with Sesame Spinach #30471 and it was a big hit. DH went back for seconds, and we all loved the noodles as well as the chicken.
Thanks for sharing!"
37305,76930,2004-11-06,4,"This was a very good dish.  There were mixed reviews from the family on the noodles, but everyone really loved the chicken.  It is a little messy doing the chicken...I guess the sugar in the marinade tends to get sticky and burn a bit, but it was worth it.  I did upload a picture...for some reason my noodles didn't get as dark as anyone elses (looking at the other pictures) but I did follow the recipe.  Thanks for sharing...I will make the chicken again and maybe serve over rice."
168462,76930,2005-07-17,5,"We loved this not only for how it tastes but for easy it was to put together. I used the 1/4 cup of sesame oil and found it just right, but we love the taste of sesame oil. I sauteed some baby carrots and added them to the cooked dish at the end. I used chicken thighs that I sliced very thin and sauteed them. This is a great dish. Thanks for the recipe."
9869,76930,2005-07-25,5,"I thought it was about time I got funky with this chicken...read through ALL the reviews so kept in mind some comments.
I was only serving 3 adults as well so cut back on some ingredients, I used a 250 m packet of angel hair pasta and 3 chicken breasts..I kept the marinade for the chicken exactly as written but for the noodles I used 1/4 cup soy sauce and just under 1/4 cup sesame oil and 1/4 cup of sugar..this was all perfect for my family's tastes and let me say that we all loved it.
I made th pasta the same time as cooking the chicken as we like our noodles warm.
Great recipe Mirj."
230557,76930,2005-10-23,1,I'm so sorry but no one in my family liked the funky chicken (didn't make the noodles).  It's probably personal preference but the exceptionally sweet flavor just wasn't for us and we couldn't finish.  But I thank you for giving me the opportunity to try something new and discover that other recipes with this type of flavor combination won't be to our liking.
222433,76930,2005-12-18,4,Really good! I only used 1/8 of a cup of sesame oil in the sauce for the noodles so it was not too oily. I also cut the chicken into slices before marinating them and it cooked very fast. I was a little worried it would be salty because of all the soy sauce but it wasn't. We will make this again.
125640,76930,2006-01-17,3,"Sorry to say we were not overly impressed. I adjusted the sauce for the noodles as I went. I guess I'm just not quite thrilled enough with the taste of sesame to eat it in such quantity, so (in a half batch) I only put a tablespoon of sesame oil and a teaspoon of sesame seeds. Turned out pretty good. I made the chicken as directed except for adding some salt and pepper and a little extra garlic and ginger, but the chicken still turned out kind of bland. Halfway through dinner DH switched to eating chips and salsa, explaining that he was 'teriyakied out'. He thought the chicken and noodles were too similar in flavor to be served together, so I might make the noodles again to go with something else, but probably won't make the whole dish again."
176615,76930,2006-01-23,5,"Super! and made even better because picky DH and the three picky boys ALL ate and enjoyed it. That NEVER happens thus this recipe merits ten stars! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. After school hours are hectic ones for us, and this is great since most of the prep is done earlier. Easy and tasty enough to serve to guests. Thanks, Mirj!"
121185,76930,2006-02-11,2,"We made this as stated, except we cut the sesame oil in 1/2 - even then, it was almost too much - but still bland (does that make sense?) Nobody scarfed this down - but nobody really complained.  My family of 5 asked that I don't make it again...Sorry! We seem to be in the minority on this one!"
184723,76930,2006-02-27,5,"In place of the 1 lb thin spaghetti, I used 5 pkgs of ramen (3 oz. a piece) YUM!!!!!  LOVED THIS!  Thanks!"
92886,76930,2006-03-07,5,"I had to try this after reading all the great reviews.  I'm a hard sell, but I have to say I am won over.  It was very simple to prepare, nothing too fussy, but really delicious.  I think I could have eaten the noodles until I popped!"
232480,76930,2006-03-24,2,"I misread the recipe and was thinking that I marinated the chicken for just a few minutes before cooking, so that's what I ended up doing as I didn't have 2-3 hours when I realized my mistake.  In retrospect, I'm VERY glad I only soaked the chicken for a few minutes because it would have been WAY too strong otherwise.  As it was it was very good.  The noodles, however, we did not like at all.  The sesame oil (I used the 1/4 c.) was very, very strong tasting and to me, overpowered the rest of the dish.  The chicken was good but it was very hard to cook without it burning.  Even though I cooked it at a lower heat (to prevent the sesame oil from smoking and breaking down) it still had a tendency to want to burn.  We definitely will not be making the noodles again, but may try the chicken with a change or two."
97579,76930,2006-04-04,5,Absolutely loved this!!!  I did take the advice and cut down on the sesame oil to even less than 1/4 cup.  I used 5 chicken breast and definately could go up to 6.  This was tasty and I will definately make it again!
158086,76930,2006-04-10,5,THis was a big hit at my oriental sunday dinner....they ate it all up...
278113,76930,2006-08-23,4,"I really enjoyed this meal, although it was a bit too sweet for us. Next time I will cut the sugar by half. Thanks for sharing!"
49304,76930,2006-10-29,5,Mirj we loved this recipe. The chicken & sesame noodles are delicious. I made the recipe as stated using splenda for the sugar and brown sugar splenda for the brown sugar. We love the flavor of sesame & this was just right. Thank you for posting the recipe.
229850,76930,2006-10-30,4,"This was good, but I thought it was wayyyy tooo much spaghetti, and the noodles didn't have enough flavor for us. I think a few things need to be added for our tastes, but thanx for posting."
140132,76930,2007-04-19,5,"We really enjoyed this.  I loved the noodles.....mmmmmm.  This chicken had great flavor as did the noodles.  I have never had sesame noodles before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I am loving this.  This recipe is very easy also, bonus....lol  Thank you for such a delicious addition to our asian menus.....Stephanie"
280271,76930,2007-04-23,5,"I just had to make this after all the recent reviews. It seemed that everyday someone was eating this!!! I felt left out! So off I went, and it sure was tasty. I had to agree with just about everyone that this is worthy of 5+ stars. I also figured out that there is only 9 WW points!! Thanks Mirj for posting..."
269331,76930,2007-05-05,5,I marinated the chicken first and used chicken filets cut into bit size pieces.  I used Chinese Noodles (10 ounces) and only used about half the noodle dressing.  We thought this was a very good recipe and enjoyed each bite.
371738,76930,2007-05-16,5,"I read A LOT of the reviews before preparing this.  So, I used a reduced sodium soy sauce and halved the sugar requirements for the noodles (making it a 1/6 cup of sugar) and LOVED it.  My husband thought it was great, too.  Will definitely make again.  If you love the sesame oil, I recommend serving with sesame broccoli (Recipe # 139885)."
362983,76930,2007-07-23,5,"Delicious! The few bad reviews made me pretty hesitant to try this at first, but I thought I would give this recipe a shot anyway. I definitely made some changes though. I did not use the measurements given but instead mainly used the ingredients list as a guide. I eyeballed my amounts.. a splash here, a dash there, to make sure nothing was overly sweet/oily. I didn't want very sweet noodles so I just used maybe less than 2 TB of sugar total, and maybe 1 TB of sesame oil. For my chicken I added a splash of sesame oil, omitted the sugar entirely and marinated it for maybe 4 hours. I used a light soy sauce too so the overall flavour of the dish was lighter and the chicken didn't burn on the stove. After cooking the chicken, I sauteed some zucchini and added some red pepper flakes for some heat. I also toasted the sesame seeds and added those at the end. Everything turned out GREAT in the end! A very pretty and tasty dish and it was so easy to put together. Thank you!"
136997,76930,2007-08-06,5,"Fabulous recipe! I was just a bit concerned about the amount of soya sauce being used, but it worked out fine. I did cut back on the sesame oil and used honey as my sweetner. I also didn't have the chicken breasts, so I used some legs I needed to use up. Marinated 2 hours and then baked them off in a 350 degree oven for aprox. 1 hour. Perfect combination of flavors. :)"
400420,76930,2007-10-01,5,"I LOVED these noodles!  I marinaded the chicken breast over night, which was too long, and it turned out dry, but the flavor was really good.  I'll be making this again!  Thanks!"
447123,76930,2007-11-26,5,Yummy!! I tried this tonight with the recipe for Japinese mums chicken (68955) and it was just awesome!!! The n oodles really tasted like sesame and soy sauce. I added some water chesnuts for some crunch. Definently a family pleaser. Thanks for posting such a great dish!!!
331557,76930,2008-01-01,3,"The chicken for this recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I cut it into large bite sized pieces ahead of time and it had wonderful flavour.  I did double the garlic and ginger and used low-sodium soy sauce.  The noodles were bland with too much of an oily aftertaste, even though I used less than 1/4 cup.  I added some chili flakes to spice it up but I won't make it again - it just wasn't my cup of tea.  In the future I will increase the marinade for the chicken and serve with rice.  Thanks for posting."
189616,76930,2008-01-05,5,"Yummy! After reading the reviews I was quite baffled on how much sugar and how much sesame oil to use for the Sesame Noodles!
For the Funky Chicken, I cut the chicken in strips and sauteed it in olive oil. For the Sesame Noodles, I added garlic and ginger and used 1 Tbsp. of sesame oil and 1/4 c. sugar. Undecided if we preferred the noodles better than the chicken since we found them both great! Served this with recipe#30471"
218535,76930,2008-02-04,5,This is very good. The leftovers are even better. My picky one-year old inhaled the noodles.
774665,76930,2008-04-26,5,This was a nice change for us. It was easy to prepare after a long day in the garden. I used 1/4 cup sesame oil and ended up adding a little extra.
532289,76930,2008-10-30,5,This was amazing.  I made exactly as posted and it turned out great.  I think I actually liked the noodles better cold and chilled.  I like cooking with soy sauce and sesame oil so the combination suited my tastes.  If you don't like soy sauce or sesame oil then this recipe probably is not for you.  If you do like sesame oil and soy sauce then I recommend you try it.  Thanks Mirj for another great recipe.
74281,76930,2008-12-01,5,"July 10, 2007 - DELICIOUS I served this warm and the only change I made was to leave out the scallions because of the onion phobic people in my house. Not only is this so easy (put the chicken in the marinade the night before) but it is DELICIOUS!!   Dec 1, 2008 UPDATE: I was craving this dish again but did not have time to marinate the chicken. Instead I marinated it while I was cooking the noodles, then dumped the chicken along with the ""Funky"" sauce into a Wok and sauteed it until the chicken was done. Then I threw the Sesame Noodles into the Wok and tossed it all together. STILL delicious and now I can have this on a whim!"
142335,76930,2009-01-09,0,"I don't know about this so I won't pick a star. Clearly I'm ""odd woman out"". I had to try it because of all the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and just didn't think it was as great as all the other reviewers. I thought it was okay just not something I'd make again or get all excited about. We love asian and all the ingred. especially soy sauce but guess I was expecting more flavor than just soy sauce based on the reviews."
191533,76930,2009-07-26,3,"This wasn't as outstanding as I expected. I might mess with the noodle part- they just tasted like they were drowning in soy sauce. The chicken was very good, and I added snow peas and onions and peppers to make it a one-dish meal."
231054,76930,2009-07-27,5,"I love submitting 5 star reviews!  But I love eating the food that resulted in all those stars even more --- and this dish was hard to STOP eating!!!  I did cut back some on the sesame oil -- but used more than the 1/4 c. that you are now suggesting.  It was perfect -- I probably used a little over a third of a cup.  It was the perfect coating for the noodles.  The chicken is absolutely devine!  The marinade ingredients are very common -- but the results certainly aren't!  I think cooking the chicken in the sesame oil really makes a difference.  I think the marinade would be good for pork as well.  Thank you, Mirj for sharing this outstanding recipe."
1179225,76930,2009-09-28,4,"Really good! I thought it was a little salty and oily, but the flavor was really yummy. Next time I'll use less oil for the noodles (a little less than 1/4 cup) and low sodium soy sauce. Thank you for posting this easy and delicious recipe."
111291,76930,2009-12-30,5,"WOW!! Easy to make and tastes fantastic. Made just as posted and ate way too much! Thanks for an amazing ""keeper"" recipe. This will be made and shared in our home often!"
353131,76930,2010-01-04,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed this! Easy to make and the taste is exceptional! Didn't have scallions so I used onion powder.Cut the chicken in strips for marinating,I also poured the marinade in with the chicken and it made a great sauce on it.Send leftovers with Dh and he shared with a co-worker who thought it was great!All three kids approved of it also!"
55578,76930,2010-01-08,5,This is great Mirj.  I used whole wheat pasta and did the 1/4 c sesame oil.  DH loved it and took it to work for lunch today!
1506604,76930,2010-04-24,4,The chicken was really good but the noodles were Not. I will def make the chicken again but don't bother with the noodles..
131021,76930,2010-05-07,5,"This was a hit. I made it for the first time at my friend's house and they all decided it was a 5 star recipe. I used 1/4 cup of sesame oil for the noodles and added frozen peas into the colander when I drained the pasta.I served the noodles hot so I cooked them at the same time as the chicken. It was an easy was to do something a little different. I even brought the leftovers home and we had them today for lunch, they were still great. Thank you. I usually cut my chicken before cooking and I have added sliced carrots to the chicken."
145352,76930,2010-09-08,5,Fantastic! My boys devoured it! I used light sesame oil to fry the chicken...and part light sesame oil in the marinade. Wasn't too strong at all.
2041603,76930,2011-10-25,5,"I loved this recipe. Everything about it. My husband didn't like the spaghetti, we're thinking it was the sesame seed oil, but loved the chicken. I found that this recipe has way too much chicken for my preferences, so I used half with the spaghetti for me and used the other half with fried rice."
839492,76930,2012-06-01,4,"****Rating is for noodles alone, with modifications***** First, I think it is very important to use low sodium soy sauce, second, reduce both the sugar & the sesame oil by at least half (that would be 1/8 c., maximum of sesame oil).  Sesame oil is a very nice flavor , however, a heavy hand can ruin the dish. Since I didn't make chicken in the recipe (made breaded, baked chicken breast tenders instead), I added some ground ginger & garlic powder with just a pinch of cayenne pepper to my sauce. I also steamed some broccoli and mixed it altogether with the noodles to complete the meal. Overall, it was received very well by my one year old, 7 year old and hubby. There were plenty of noodles left over (a pound is a lot around here), so I'm thinking about some cold noodles tomorrow for lunch with maybe a few sliced onions & sugar snap peas for crunch! Thanks for sharing"
1052873,76930,2013-03-24,5,"Awesome! Halved the recipe, used angel hair pasta. Made with leftover rabbit. Made noodles and let sit. Mixed up marinade and put in chopped up meat, let sit out about 30 minutes, then heated to boiling. Poured off marinade. Heated up noodles a little in the microwave and served."
226863,76930,2013-08-15,3,"I wasn&#039;t crazy about the noodles. I found them a bit too sweet.  But I really enjoyed the chicken.  This is very easy to make, which is also a plus.  Thanks for sharing!"
1581225,76930,2017-02-09,3,"While my husband and I thought this was nice, the kids didn't go crazy for this. I followed the recipe exactly. The noodles were tasty, but I didn't think they needed the sesame seeds, they were a bit too much for me. I also think veggies are needed, so I cooked some red pepper strips in the pan after the chicken was done. I probably wouldn't make this again as there are other dishes I like more."
28649,27144,2002-05-09,5,This was easy and very moist.  The whole family loved it.  Very chocolatey!!!!  I will be making this again!!
13483,27144,2003-07-16,5,This was beyond amazing!!  5 stars is not enough for this.  So simple to make and a knock out taste.  So glad you posted this.
59780,27144,2003-07-31,5,"What an Awesome recipe! Who knew that you could create a chocolate masterpiece with boxed mixes? I am going to keep these ingredients on hand so I can whip up this tasty treat in a moment's notice. My husband was so disappointed when I forgot the leftovers at our friend's place--I guess he was looking forward finishing it off at home. (Truth be told, I probably would have beat him to it, so it was probably better for my waist that we did leave it behind-lol!) I will be making this again, thanks for sharing this recipe!"
52262,27144,2003-08-28,5,Oh my!  What a delicious tasting cake!  I can't believe how easy it was to make.  It didn't taste like a doctored cake mix at all.  Wonderful!
37449,27144,2004-03-26,5,"This cake turned out nice and light and of course, yummy! I didn't let it cool long enough and turned it upside down and it fell apart a little, but no problem! We just ate it right up anyway! Thanks for a healthier way to fix a chocolate fix!"
121185,27144,2004-09-18,4,This was VERY good and VERY moist!!!  The glaze was soo yummy too - it pooled around the bottom of the cake and made that part even more moist and chocolatey (as if that was even possible!)  Great with a scoop of vanilla- YUM!
58836,27144,2004-10-07,4,Pretty good chocolate cake.  It is almost too chocolately.  I used white choc pudding cause I didn't have any choc and it turned out fine.  Thanks.
146486,27144,2004-12-06,5,This was very easy to make and made a good quick dessert.  Very moist!
103876,27144,2005-02-20,5,This is the perfect chocolate lover's cake.  It is dark and rich.  I heated my piece slightly and it was even better that way.  Would be great with vanilla icecream.
51011,27144,2005-02-21,5,I made this for my dh for valentines this year- OMG it was sooooo awesome! Flavorful and moist- how can it get better?  The only change I made was to add a bit of cinnamon to the batter (I always do this to chocolate cake)Thanks so much for  sharing!
33159,27144,2005-03-27,5,This is the perfect recipe for the chocolate lover!  It's very quick to make & very delicious & moist.  The shape & glaze make this cake look extra fancy.
50969,27144,2005-03-27,5,"i wanted a special cake for our Easter dessert,and i'm so glad i picked this one.it's just so rich and chocolaty.this will be made again.my B/F had this with chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. it was just so good.thank you again."
140806,27144,2005-06-08,5,"I must redo my review and change this recipe from a 4-star to a 5-star! I have been asked to make this numerous times since I first tried it, and every time I make this it gets better. I do have to increase the baking time for high altitude but it is worth it! This is quickly becoming an all-time favorite in my family. FYI: You will drop dead when you try this with fresh raspberries or strawberries."
56087,27144,2005-09-05,5,"This definately is all about chocolate.  PERFECT for the chocoholic like me.  I didn't actually make it, I printed the recipe, bought the ingredients, gave all to my daughter along with a bundt pan and said ""this is what I want for my birthday"".  She said is was super easy to put together, her roommate said the smell was to die for, I thought the flavor was.  Thanks for sharing what should be a 10 star recipe."
218535,27144,2005-11-15,5,I baked this cake without the glaze. It was delicious. Eat it warm when the chocolate chips are still gooey.
49304,27144,2005-11-26,5,"OH MY GOODNESS, what a delicious chocolate cake. Everyone, young & older raved about this rich, moist, chocolately cake. So easy to make yet so delicious that I am going to be making it to take to a pot luck this next weekend. Thank you, very much for posting this yummy recipe."
131021,27144,2005-12-01,4,"Took it to Thanksgiving dinner. It was quite a hit. We discussed how many stars and decided on 4. It didn't get five because it wasn't ""WOW"". We will definately make it again and we loved how easy it was. I think next time we might try it with pecans."
329638,27144,2006-08-28,5,"This was by far the most delicious and the moistest cake I have ever made!  I added 1/2 cup sour cream to the cake batter and used chopped sweet and dark chocolate bars (no chocolate chips) and added an extra 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the glaze to make it a little bit thicker.
It was so delicious, thanks so much for sharing!"
185926,27144,2006-11-04,5,"Easy and delicious. I followed the recipe as posted, except, I baked it in 6 mini bundt pans and a dozen mini bundt cupcake pans.  It only took 20 minutes to bake.  Glaze is nice, but not necessary.  The cake is so moist and chocolaty."
32058,27144,2006-12-25,5,"Great cake, incredibly moist!  Will make again and again!"
140132,27144,2007-01-30,5,oh my goodness.  This is heavenly.  I made this the other night for dessert and my kids went nuts.  It is to die for. Very chocolatey but so so good.  I loved the glaze as it seemed to soak into the cake as it sat....yummmy.  I didn't change a thing to the recipe and never will.  But i will be making this again......Stephanie
100526,27144,2007-03-19,4,"We have been searching for a copycat recipes for the now retired Outback Steakhouse Chocolate cake. This one came so close and is delicious. We just need to find another recipe for frosting. My family did not care for the glaze with this cake.

Thanks for the recipe!"
229524,27144,2007-03-28,5,"This has to be the BEST cake recipe EVER!!!!!! It doesn't get any better then this. The cake is soooooooooooo moist and oh my, its so chocolatey. I did add 2 Tablespoons of flour,to the dry cake mix, because I live in Colorado. The glaze is fantastic too. This is our favorite cake now. Thanks a bunch CCinSC for sharing such a fantastic recipe."
265954,27144,2007-04-11,5,"Made this for Easter dinner.  It was a big hit.  Even my husband, who isn't a fan of chocolate, asked for seconds.  I did add chopped pecans to the glaze.  Thanks for the recipe!!"
80998,27144,2007-06-03,5,"Like this needs another review! However, have to say this was wonderful. It was very easy to make. We had company and everyone loved it! My husband wasn't convinced I had made it. He said it ""looked"" to pretty. I had to show him the recipe to prove it. Very moist and rich. Reminded me so much of an expensive restraunt dessert. I still can't believe how easy this was."
187373,27144,2007-07-22,5,"Delicious and really moist! But, be warned...have milk handy...this cake is crazy rich!  Love it! Thanks CC!"
307214,27144,2007-09-24,5,Great Birthday cake (tasted almost like brownies).  The vanilla ice cream really makes the cake!
158086,27144,2007-10-18,5,Wonderful cake! I made it with 50% less sugar box cake mix and sugar free pudding....turned out great...
386849,27144,2007-10-19,5,"Everyone loved this cake and it was very easy to put together.  The only suggestion that I would make is to be careful as you remove it from the pan.  It is very moist and mine came apart into 3 pieces.  It wasnt a problem once I put the chocolate glaze over the top, though! :)"
242484,27144,2008-02-20,5,I used this glaze for another bundt cake and it was awesome!!!
8688,27144,2008-04-16,5,"We just loved this cake!  So moist and chocolaty!  I made this using Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips to add just that added touch (plus, it was all I had on hand ;) ). I also doubled the chocolate glaze.  Otherwise, made exactly as directed.  There isn't one thing I would change about this recipe.  Perfect as is.  Thanks so much, CCinSC!"
185285,27144,2008-04-23,5,"I did a slightly different take on this recipe.  Using a kitchen scale, I halved the recipe and used mini bundts for individual servings.  For the glaze, I offered two options: One milk chocolate and one dark chocolate. Most people actually preferred the dark version, as it was more potent in taste for the bite-sized pieces. Great dessert for a crowd!"
497077,27144,2008-05-26,5,"WOW-what a cake!!! Made for my chocoholic DH and he loved it!!! I used only 1 cup of chocolate chips and that was plenty for us and I included some chopped pecans in the glaze. I only have an 8-cup bundt pan and that is too small for this recipe so I also made some cupcakes which were great, too. Thank you for a great recipe!!!"
180090,27144,2008-06-13,5,"This was wonderful! I didn't even make the chocolate glaze because it was sweet enough without it. My cake didn't come out of the bundt pan in one piece, so next time I'll make sure to grease and flour even more and possibly bake for 55 minutes instead of 50. Thanks for sharing!"
620763,27144,2008-07-12,5,"Wow! So rich, moist, and chocolatey!  This cake screams for vanilla ice cream!  A chocoholic's dream!"
914720,27144,2008-10-08,5,"Wow!  This is definitely chocolatey.  The cake is very moist, and the glaze was the perfect consistency with 2 T water - it drizzled down the sides of the cake, but most of it stayed on the cake instead of ending up on the plate.  Was very easy to assemble, and looked very impressive.  Thanks for sharing!"
177933,27144,2009-03-16,5,Great cake...especially loved the glaze!!!
252816,27144,2009-08-06,5,I used chocolate fudge instant pudding..Also used 2-6 cup  heavy cast mini bundt pans ..I bought off ebay as its just my DH and myself...I froze one ungrazed will glaze when thawed out in the future..Baked for 25-30 minutes..SOooooooGoooood..The only chocolate cake I will make from now on...Thank U so much for this wonderfully rich decadent dessert...
231054,27144,2009-10-27,5,I'm just getting ready to make a couple of these cakes for a bake sale -- and realized I had never submitted a review!!!!  Not sure how that happened.  I've made several of these cakes and they are delicious.  They are a snap  to make -- no one would ever guess that it's a packaged mix.  The cake is super moist and makes for a beautiful presentation.
149363,27144,2009-12-23,5,"Wow, just....wow. This is now my ""go to"" recipe for a no fail, moist, simple chocolate cake. I have used this countless times for catering jobs, one client remarked ""That cake is magic!"" and I have to agree. :) I use the icing recipe below but omit the cocoa for a white contrast against the dark brown of the cake, and surround the cake with raspberries and blackberries, serve it on a white platter and it's stunning! Very simple and clean looking presentation. I also always double this recipe and simple divide it between 2 pans. I love the fact that there is no extra oil in this cake! Just awesome we love this recipe! :)"
269331,27144,2010-12-29,5,"Followed the recipe; it was very easy to make and had most of the ingredients on hand.  The cake was nice and moist and the chocolate glaze%u2026 over the top tasty.  If you like chocolate, you will love this recipe.  I will definitely make this wonder bundt again!"
91392,27144,2011-05-04,5,"Easy, fast, not expensive and a good doctored up recipe for things bought in packages.  Nice consistency.  I used only half the chocolate chips and it was perfect.<br/><br/>Good one!"
1052873,27144,2011-09-02,5,This is it - the cake my roommate made for everybody's birthday! Love it!
92816,27144,2011-12-11,5,"So chocolatey!This is very tasty and moist.I made a 2 layer cake with 2 8 inch pans and used Frosting # 89207 instead of the glaze here.Very decadent,goes great with a glass of milk."
37779,27144,2011-12-28,4,"Made this for Christmas Eve dessert. Intense chocolate flavor and very easy to make. I'll always prefer cake made from scratch, but this is a very good alternative when you don't have the time. Thanks for posting."
540346,27144,2012-11-15,5,"So moist and delicious!  This was a hit with kids and guests alike and so easy to make.  This would be great for potlucks, too.  Update:  I have made this several times and always get compliments on it.  I have made it and decorated for a friend's ""Over the Hill"" birthday and did not have problems with crumbs.  I have also made cupcakes and decorated them.  This is a fantastic recipe.  I suggest using miniature chocolate chips; it spreads the chocolate out more."
1581225,27144,2017-07-14,3,"This was a bit rich for my personal taste. I probably would have preferred the devils food cake mix on its own. The choc chips and pudding made it too chocolatey and heavy for me. Others in the family enjoyed it, but I won't make it again. It was a very easy recipe, and quick to make, I'll give it that."
104295,149363,2006-01-25,5,We loved this!  I was a little concerned because of the fact that it uses just splenda as sometimes there is a splenda aftertaste.  But there was no noticeable aftertaste.  It is totally the best part of the pumpkin pie.  I made it completely as written and served it with a dollop of fat free coolwhip.  A great healthy dessert!  Thanks so much!
38643,149363,2007-10-02,5,I didn't have any cloves but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written. You've got a winner here.
307214,149363,2010-06-06,5,Great.  Made in ramekins (about 45 minutes at 325).  I will mostly alter the spices next time and I like less spice and more pumpkin taste.
928301,26339,2010-03-19,5,very good.  and only requires one dish!
59780,26339,2004-10-04,5,Simple and yummy! This was recommended to me by my friend (Melanie In Winnipeg) and we just loved it. I used Bobbie Q Sauce recipe#59772 for the sauce and fresh green onions from my garden. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!
158086,26339,2005-04-14,5,"My significant other said to give this recipe a five star rating, and this is to become his favorite chicken....so it sounds like a keeper to me..."
176615,26339,2005-04-21,5,"I really did not expect this to be SO GOOD! I was looking for something quick to make for a busy night, something which the kids might actually eat. This was a big surprise. I'm not a BBQ sauce lover, but the combination of the sauce with bacon (I used crumbled bacon) and cheese in the oven produces a fantastic result. Chicken was moist and flavorful and the family gobbled it down. I also had some great leftovers for lunch the next day. Thanks, Wende, we really enjoyed it!"
59473,26339,2005-05-10,5,"This was a very tasty dish. The combination of barbecue sauce, cheese and bacon was out of this world. Like some other reviewers I used crumbled bacon. I may try this with montery jack cheese next time."
136997,26339,2005-06-08,5,"Sooo good! I used Diana's Hickory Smoked BBQ Sauce which complimented the bacon very nicely. I didn't have green onions, so I subbed chives instead and it tasted just fine.  "
280271,26339,2006-09-17,5,"Wow! This was really good! DH rated it a 5 star and I agree with him. This was easy to prepare. Also looks great plated. I cook them on the BBQ and they came out excellent. I served some of the barbecue sauce on the side. This will be made again. Thanks, Wende for posting. "
124249,26339,2006-09-23,5,"This was a easy and flavorful chicken dish. We thought it would also make a great chicken sandwich. It's a keeper.

Thanks Wende.

Bullwinkle."
91392,26339,2006-09-24,5,"Loved it, fast and easy too.  Was even good as leftovers and I think would be fantastic on a sandwich."
145352,26339,2006-12-19,5,This was great and sooo easy!!! One of my kids declared it his favorite chicken dish!
331557,26339,2007-07-14,3,My boyfriend really liked this dish.  Thanks for sharing.
80998,26339,2007-09-09,4,very good and easy recipe for any quick meal.
199792,26339,2007-12-03,4,This recipe has great flavour. I don't know if I did something wrong but my chicken came out very tough. I think next time I will brown it in the skillet and then transfer to the oven. I love the way the flavours all enhance one another. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
191533,26339,2008-01-14,5,"Absolutely wonderful, just as expected! I didn't have any onions, which was fine. I used real bacon bits and that worked well. I used 5 chicken breasts cut in half and layered in a 9x9 pan; they just fit in one layer. It took 35 minutes at 375degrees. 'Sweet Baby Rays' bbq sauce is the best! (Buy at any U.S. grocery store!)"
248023,26339,2008-04-01,4,"My BF is a huge fan of barbeque sauce... he could eat it on anything.  So of course he loved this dish.  I am quite picky when it comes it sauce and the bottled sauce I had on hand was way too sweet for my tastes.  I really did not like the combination of cheese, sauce and bacon at all... but that is not the fault of the recipe, but rather my choice in sauce.  I did love the simplicity of the recipe and how fork tender the breasts were...  We may try this one again with some homemade sauce sometime... thanks for sharing!"
470351,26339,2008-06-14,4,"Really good dish.  It's a dish that's probably only as good as the BBQ sauce you choose to use so make sure to use one you know you love.  The combo of the BBQ sauce, bacon and cheese was really yummy.  It was also very easy to prepare.  I used bacon bits and it worked great.  I also doubled the green onions.  Thanks for a nice quick chicken dish."
229524,26339,2008-06-29,5,"WOW, we loved this recipe.  The flavors are FANTASTIC on this.  Used my homemade barbecue sauce.  The chicken came out so very tender.  This will certainly become one of our favorite chicken dishes."
312577,26339,2008-07-02,5,Great flavor!  I like that it is a new twist on chicken.  I pounded out my chicken breasts and used regular bacon which I cooked with the chicken.  Easy directions.  I added a bit of liquid smoke to my barbecue sauce too.
368078,26339,2008-11-21,5,Yummy!!!  We thought this was amazing!  The BBQ sauce made the chicken really moist and tender after cooking!  We cut chicken breasts in half and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes.  It was the perfect cooking time.  Like some of the other reviewers we too added the green onion at the end.  This quick and easy recipe will be one that we will make often!  Thanks so much Wende!
400420,26339,2008-11-29,5,"Well, I forgot the bacon and green onion, but even so, I liked this.  DD didn't care as much for it, but I think it was more the flavor of the BBQ Sauce, Recipe #19023.  I liked the sauce and the chicken was jucy and tender.  Thanks for an easy, tasty meal."
140132,26339,2008-12-01,5,Delicious!  We loved these.  I served these with oven fries and a salad.  Thank you for posting.
262312,26339,2009-01-11,5,"tasty recipe!  this is a keeper for sure.  i loved the combination of bbq sauce, bacon and cheese.  i did make some changes.  i used thin cut pork chops cuz that's what i had, i cooked the pork in a pan ahead of time, i made a mixture of bbq sauce and dijon mustard, i added some serrano pepper slices after the sauce before the bacon, i used peppered thick cut bacon, and topped it all off with pico de gallo and sliced green onions.  served with spanish rice and green chile pull apart bread.  dh couldn't stop raving about how awesome it was!!  definite keeper in my book.  will make often.  great make ahead dish. thanks a lot!"
198154,26339,2009-01-27,4,Please look at this rating as a 4 1/2 stars. Everyone in our family rated it either 4 or 5 stars but the 4 stars won out by a single vote.  I made a vegetarian version for the non-meat eaters using quorn cutlets in place of the chicken breast and temph bacon.  I just put the still frozen BBQ covered quorn cutlets in the oven at the same time as the chicken breasts.  The Quorn didn't dry out that way and everything took the same amount to time to cook.
879716,26339,2009-02-22,5,Pure awesomeness.  I made this on the stovetop too.  I used sauteed yellow onion just because my weird fiance has a hatred of green onions.
199020,26339,2010-04-07,5,Great topped with fresh pico de gallo and sour cream! We made these on the stove top with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.
1506604,26339,2010-06-24,5,"Really unexpectedly nice. I wish there was more direction in relation to the times. This is what I determined: Bake chicken firstly for 20-25 minutes and then with cheese for 4-8 minutes. I made it with the bacon and it was nice but it's not really necessary for this dish, it's like eating steak and chicken, do you really need the chicken in that dish? no. Really nice and simple; a great bbq dish without tasting like you're at a cookout."
439797,26339,2010-07-02,5,"Here's how I made it.  Baked frozen breasts for 50 minutes at 375 (topped with a little sauce).  Then added more sauce, bacon bits and put it back in the oven until the cheese melted.  Topped with the onion.  Served it with homemade mashed red skinned potato salad and my kids and husband loved it!"
55729,26339,2011-02-27,0,"We really enjoyed this, but since I changed it quite a bit, I wouldn't necessarily give any stars (turned out about 4*, though). I did a C.O.R.N. of sauces using a combination of Bulls Eye BBQ, Bulls Eye BBQ that had been ""doctored"" for another recipe, homemade Catalina dressing, homemade balsamic-mustard dressing, and Kraft Honey Mustard dressing to total 1 1/2 c. for the 6 chicken breasts I was using. I baked at 375 for 30 min. before adding the cheese (mild cheddar) and bacon. I only had about 3 1/2 pieces of bacon and I chopped them before cooking to make bacon bits. I served this with Recipe #65427 and some crescent rolls (which were the reason for changing the oven temperature)."
810787,26339,2011-05-11,3,"This was just okay. It was easy to make, but just didn't do a lot for us."
407007,26339,2011-05-26,5,"YUM! This is great stuff. Left out the green onions & used low-fat cheese, but otherwise followed exactly. Thanks for sharing -- it's a keeper!"
383346,26339,2012-02-20,5,This is so yummy.  I used recipe#19023 for the bbq sauce.  Thanks Wende :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
173579,26339,2013-11-08,5,This is a must try.  It was simply delicious.  So quick and easy too.  Thanks for posting such a lovely recipe.
52125,221743,2007-12-13,5,"The chicken turned out really moist and very tender and the skin was crispy, I really loved that! I did cook my chicken longer as I had almost a 7 pound chicken. I also increased the oil and butter and the seasonings slightly. I will do this recipe again! Your recipes are always winners, Thanks Kittencal...."
229524,221743,2007-12-16,5,WOW oh WOW!!!  OHHHH the flavor!!!!  My DH said this is the best chicken ever. Kittencal your recipes really ROCK :)
52262,221743,2008-01-17,5,"Great and easy chicken recipe!  I used a cut-up chicken with the skin removed.  I cooked it the same amount of time, but I only let if sit for about 5 minutes under the foil."
666723,221743,2008-10-12,5,"So delicious. I made this exactly as directed, but with 2 split chickens. I just put the onion quarters under the pieces. The skin was delish and the meat very flavorfull and tender. Thanks for the EASY recipe!  **UPdate** Made this again since I loved the method!  I used a whole chicken this time and used the recipe for Lime cilantro Whole chicken Recipe #271347  for my seasonings.  Again, this turned out really great and boy oh boy the house smells awesome!"
8688,221743,2008-12-13,5,"This is the most tender and juiciest chicken I have ever tasted!  I used  a 5 pound chicken and adjusted the cooking time accordingly, otherwise preparing the recipe as written using the juice of 1 whole lemon and adding the cayenne to the seasoning mix. and also using the onion inside the chicken cavity.  The will become my standard roast chicken recipe!  Thank you so much, Kittencal for always being there with the perfect recipe!"
29014,221743,2009-01-17,5,"This was perfect and SO easy!  I had a large chicken so I had to roast for one hour after the high-heat 20 minutes.
From now on, this is my go-to recipe for roasted chicken.
Thanks, KC!"
199792,221743,2009-02-16,5,"Excellent chicken. I roasted two small chickens and there is not much left. I will make a lemon rice and chicken soup tomorrow with the carcass. I quartered a lemon and put it inside the chicken for a little extra lemon flavour. I never have seasoning salt in the house so I made my own using Recipe #78572. It was great and I am so glad to have it on hand now. Thanks for sharing your recipe, I look forward to having it on our table many more times."
195589,221743,2009-02-20,5,"This was excellent, easy and so delicious! Like another reviewer, I added half a lemon along with the onions to the cavity.  I also used 3 Tbs. of lemon juice in the rub as we like that zing. Thanks so much for posting, Kittencal, this goes into my Tried & True cookbook!"
100526,221743,2009-02-24,5,"I forgot to review this when we first had it.  My family loves this recipe! I was able to pull this recipe out at 4:00pm yesterday and have dinner on the table in 1 1/2 hours. The only change I make is omitting the Seasoning salt (not my thing) and just adding some kosher salt to the other spices I sprinkle on before roasting.

The bird is gorgeous and juicy!"
579298,221743,2009-02-25,5,"Wow! I loved this recipe!! For the seasoning, I used 1.5 TBS of Seasoned Salt and 1 TBS of Chili Seasoning. Delicious!"
329638,221743,2009-03-11,5,"Made this for dinner tonight, to rave reviews,  Dh declared it better than the storebought rotisserie chickens (and we are huge fans of those).  This si a keeper for sure, thanks so much for posting!"
353131,221743,2009-03-17,5,This has to be the best and easiest roast chicken we have ever eaten!!Had a 4lb. bird the only thing I did differently was add lemon pepper salt along with season salt. Baked @ 450 for 20min. baked @ 400 for 50 min. Chicken was @ 175 degrees. when I took it out of the oven.Let it sit for exactly 15 minutes. It sliced beautifully and was so very juicy!!! Yum!
140132,221743,2009-03-24,5,"This is a very good recipe that had great flavor and the chicken stayed nice and juicy on the inside.  As always Kittencal you came through for my family with this winner of a chicken dinner.  I love the fact that you put the onions in the center.....so good.  Thank you for posting, as I will most definately make this again."
937635,221743,2009-06-25,5,"Fantastic chicken! Wow!!! My hubby was awed - this is definitely going to become a regular dish for us. I cut a lemon in half and squeezed all of the juice from it for the marinade and then stuffed one of the halves in the cavity along with a quartered onion. Delish! I also roasted a whole head of garlic with the chicken and made smashed potatoes with a roasted garlic gravy on the side. Thank you, Kittencal, you rock!"
269331,221743,2009-12-31,5,"Wow, this chicken recipe is dynamite!  I made as directed except I added a shallot and a couple of cloves of garlic to the cavity.  I used a rack placed in a roasting pan, I think next time I will add some liquid to the bottom of the pan because it got quite smoky (smoke detector went offâ€¦ ha, ha)."
177933,221743,2010-01-05,5,"10 stars, 10 stars!!!  This was the most delicious chicken ever!!  I had a larger chicken 4-5lbs and as you recommended Kitten, I roasted at 475 for the 20 minutes and then at 400 for a whole hour.  I doubled the butter/oil/lemon mixture and added celery salt and herbs de provence to the seasonings.  I rubbed the chicken both under and on top of the skin and let it marinate for just 45 minutes.  It was so moist and perfectly cooked and the skin, wow... was just amazing.  My husband and I both are so very happy with this recipe!!  Thank you so much Kitten!!"
844554,221743,2010-02-15,5,"I have to admit I used this recipe for the cooking method. I used a different spice mixture but next time I think I'll try this mixture. Anyway, the chicken came out great -- it does get brown on the outside. Thanks for this one!"
55578,221743,2010-05-07,5,"Very good.  I used  7 lb chicken and it was delish.  I did have a hard time getting the spices to stay on though, but all and all very tasty!"
37036,221743,2010-10-23,0,Very moist and tender!  We loved this chicken. Even my husband who doesn't normally care for chickend enjoyed it cooked this way.  I didn't make any chages to the recipe and would definitely make this again.  Thanks Kittencal for another great recipe!
103876,221743,2011-01-27,5,Very easy and good way to make a whole chicken. The meat turned out tender and juicy and my whole family enjoyed it. Thanks for posting.
142464,221743,2011-03-06,5,"WOW!!!  Was told about this recipe by NoraMarie, so today I decided I would try it.  The chicken turned out so nice and moist with such a beautiful crispy skin.  A very easy recipe with pleasing end results.  This is how I plan to roast chicken from now on.  Thanks for this gem of a recipe, Kittencal."
285039,221743,2011-04-04,5,"I am rating on the technique, not necessarily the combination of spices because I added 3 T of Famous Dave's Roast Chicken Spice and 1/4 fresh rosemary to enough butter and oil for 2 chickens.  The skin was wonderfully crispy and the meat was moist.  Great, quick method for cooking whole chickens!  Ance again a great Kittencal recipe!"
236170,221743,2011-05-25,5,The skin on this chicken was crunchy and tasty! Love this recipe and it will be my new whole chicken go-to recipe. Thanks!
456858,221743,2011-10-20,4,"This was good. I think the taste is similar to the rotisserie chickens you can buy at the grocery stores.  I question if its worth the hassle? I guess it is, u know what you're eating.  But, would probably not make again ;-("
532289,221743,2015-11-26,5,I just realized I haven&#039;t rated this yet.  I&#039;ve made it several times and it has never failed.  I use the carcass to make Kittencal&#039;s Best Chicken Stock Broth.  Cook a 5 pound chicken in under 2 hours.
218535,221743,2017-03-17,5,The skin was so good.
135887,106715,2004-12-24,0,"What about the brown sugar, water, W-sauce,and soy sauce???"
8629,106715,2005-01-16,5,"Nice and sweet tasting.  Now that I am reviewing the recipe I noticed that I forgot to put in the Worcestershire sauce. Darn it!  I'll get it right next time.  I used all chicken breast pieces and there was no fat to drain at all as suggested in step 7.

I sprayed the pan lightly with  vegetable spray before putting the chicken in.  I used only 1/2 of the chicken amount but made the full sauce amount.  Then  when it came time to add the sauce to the chicken, I only poured in 1/2 of the amount.  The other half I left in the saucepan and thickened with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespooon of cold water.  That made a very nice dipping sauce for the completed chicken."
95743,106715,2005-03-01,5,Loved the flavor and appearance of this made with skinless leg/thigh quarters. Tempted to lick my fingers - the sauce is sweet and wonderful.
203111,106715,2005-10-14,0,Caution:  I don't believe it's considered safe to cook chicken at such low temps (200 and 250)
222433,106715,2006-01-03,5,"Thanks for an awesome recipe Zusie-Q! I used boneless skinless thighs so I was a little worried about the time because I did not want them to dry out. I roasted them for 1 hr on 200 then upped it to about 300. It was done in about 2-2 1/4 hours total. I also used my meat therm. to test for doneness. I basted them several times. They were perfect. Very, very moist. Fabulous flavor. I served it with Thai Coconut Rice#63446 and Sesame Broccoli #139885. Great meal!"
91392,106715,2006-01-07,5,"Definately a five star recipe.  I did it exactly as written, the times and temps and all and the sauce is perfect and not runny.  No problem with the chicken cooking to super tender either.  We loved it.  I served it with dal and basmati rice and I can't wait to eat the leftovers.  A must do, if you can take the sweetness. I used a whole chicken cut apart, but I think this may be even better with just the dark meat."
278113,106715,2006-01-11,5,Add another 5 stars..cause my family all LOVES this chicken. My daughter is still talking about it!! Thanks for a delish recipe that the whole family can enjoy!
286851,106715,2006-03-01,4,"I used chicken thighs and it turned out well. The sauce is sticky and sweet, and my husband really liked how it baked onto the chicken skin. Will make again. (I tried to speed up the recipe a bit this time by upping the oven temp--I probably wouldn't do that again--it caused the sauce to darken and burn just a bit. I think the slowness probably adds to the success of the sauce.)"
169969,106715,2006-05-27,5," Excellent Chicken! We loved this so much it is now on permanent rotation (and not very many things are!). The sauce was excellent! This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I used bone-in chicken breasts and they were moist and juicy with a slightly crunchy crust and gooey glaze..... perfection in the kitchen! Thanks for posting! -- posted Dec 25, 2005  UPDATE: Well like I said in December this is now on permanent rotation at our house. The last time I made this recipe I followed the cooking temps that you have in the directions (instead of rushing it) and I must say there IS a difference - Just when i thought it couldn't get better - IT DID. If you have the time to follow the low temp cooking instructions, do give it a shot. So moist and tender and the marinade really sinks into the breast. Also the sauce thickens way better as it cooks longer. Again, I have only made this recipe with bone-in chicken and it is fabulous!"
174991,106715,2006-06-23,5,"I followed the direction as stated.  I had some skinless legs and thighs that I used and this turned out great.  The meat was very moist and the sauce is wonderful, sweet but more oveerly sweet.  the next time I'll try it in the crockpot and see how it comes out. "
52125,106715,2006-08-24,5,"This chicken is to die for, it is so good! I just knew I had to try it when I saw the picture ncmysteryshopper had posted, yummy.  I followed your directions exactly and it turned out nice and moist and the sauce is so delish! This will go into my favorites cookbook. Thanks for posting a great recipe Zusie-Q...."
222055,106715,2006-09-01,5,"This was great. I used chicken breast and I doubled the sauce because of some of the other reviews, and found I really didn't need to. I have all that sauce left. The only problem I had, and I don't really know if it is a problem, is that when I turned the chicken over, I lost all the coating. It was okay, I just spooned the thickened part over the chicken on our plates. Thank you Zusie-Q for a Wonderful Chicken recipe!!!"
168462,106715,2006-10-27,5,This stuff is fantastic. Even my daughter who does not like any type of meat/chicken liked this. It is easy to throw together too. Thanks for such a great recipe.
357358,106715,2006-12-10,5,"This chicken has a wonderful flavor and boy was I hungry after smelling that cooking all afternoon! I followed the directions exactly, except I used chicken cutlets. The cutlets got a bit too dry on the inside (next time I will use the chicken breasts). Good thing I doubled the recipe because there was plenty of dipping sauce. Excellent served with #135350. Thanks Zusie-Q."
140132,106715,2007-02-08,5,"Yum yum.  This is appropriately named because they are very sticky and very delicious.  I used drumsticks, as it was all i had on hand and my family went back for more and more....lol.  This has really good flavor and tasted good warm and cold the next day.  I will make these again as my whole family enjoyed these very much.  My only suggestion is......DONT FORGET THE NAPKINS!   Delicious....thank you so much....Stephanie"
199792,106715,2007-02-08,5,Yumm! We all liked this chicken recipe. Mine didn't look as pretty as the picture but it tasted so good! I used skinless breasts. I only had 3 breasts so decreased the flour to 1/4 cup and adjusted the spices slightly as well. The sauce thickened up very nicely. My husband suggested cutting the breasts into smaller pieces to get more of the juices on every bite. Would it be rude to lick your plate??
33159,106715,2007-03-17,4,"We enjoyed this recipe - very nice flavour!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts & watched closely as I thought the cooking time might be too much.  But, the chicken stayed in the oven for the full 3 hours & ended up nice & moist."
377039,106715,2007-03-24,5,"Delicious. I skipped the paprika because I hadn't realized I'd run out, used drumsticks, and cooked at the higher temp.  The only thing we didn't love about the recipe is that although as a glaze, the sauce is wonderful; it doesn't work on it's own -- too sweet. We threw away leftover sauce.  Next time I might try halving the sugar and the water, and add a bit of ginger into the sauce.  But it was wonderful as is!"
265954,106715,2007-06-15,4,"This is a very tasty recipe.  I didn't have the 3 hours necessary to cook it, so I cooked the chicken breasts at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then added the sauce and cooked at the same temp for another 10 minutes, basting the chicken twice.  I didn't have soy sauce, so I used 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce instead, and the glaze came out great.  I served the chicken over white rice and steamed carrots."
269331,106715,2007-06-23,5,"I used bone-in chicken thighs.  After the first hour of cooking, I did not have anything to drainâ€¦ so maybe I will start at a higher temperature.  Anyway, they turned out wonderfully!!"
294000,106715,2007-07-17,5,"This is excellent!  I used about drumsticks... it definitely did not need to cook as long.  I cooked for an hour at 200... then poured the sauce and raised the temp to 250... I took it out after an hour and wish I had taken it out a little earlier as the sauce was thick and not ""saucy"".  Still, the flavor is fantastic and we will make it again!  Thank you."
353131,106715,2007-12-11,5,All I need to say is WOW!!!!! This was a terrific recipe. I used leg quarters and did not change a thing about the recipe. The chicken was moist and flavorful! The sauce was outstanding!!! I have been craving chinese and didn't want to go get take out! This really hit the spot!!!! I might try this with breasts cut into 1in. cubes and adjust the cooking time to see if I can kinda make an appetizer with this!12/11/07 Update! I gave this recipe to my sister and she tried it yesterday. She said it was absolutely awesome and she and her DH made pigs of themselves!! Great recipe. I am going to make it again tomorrow!
250031,106715,2008-01-13,5,"Outstanding! My family loved it, especially two of my daughters. One daughter said, ""Mom, that's my new favorite recipe!"" And it's to be added to the list of ""must-make"" foods for when our Oklahoma boys visit us, according to the girls."
774665,106715,2008-04-10,5,This was good. I made it with boneless thigh but will make it again with bone in thigh because I think it will be better that way. I didn't need a whole half a cup of flour so I adjusted the spice.
180090,106715,2008-08-05,5,"So yummy! I love the flavor of the sauce with the chicken thighs! I left out the ginger because I didn't have any. I baked at 200 for 1 hour, then 250 for 1 hour, then upped it to 300 for the last hour to try to crisp up the skin. It came out very moist. At the end I also broiled for a few minutes to carmelize the sauce a little. Next time I'll try browning the chicken on the stove before baking so the skin gets crisper. Thanks for this winner! I'll be making it regularly!"
248023,106715,2008-08-19,5,"Wow!!!  I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone who likes General Tso's chicken or any sweet and sour dish...  We used thighs...  I think the long cooking time really releases a lot of the grease and makes the meat amazingly juicy and tender.  Unless bone in chicken breasts were used, I think they would dry out too much...  I didn't expect such a delicious, crispy, almost candy-like skin on the thighs... when I first took them out of the oven they didn't look too crispy but after cooling a bit they did.  My BF loved that part!  The sauce thickened up great with the long cooking time...  I did flip the chicken 4 times to coat evenly.  My BF says this is his ""new"" favorite chicken dish...  served it with Recipe #240456 and some steamed broccoli dressed with lemon juice and olive oil.  Great meal!  Thanks for sharing!!!"
632249,106715,2008-10-28,5,"Let me say that this was delicious and simple.  I would suggest that you check the internal temperature to be sure it is 190F.  I checked mine after 3 hrs 15 min and the internal temp was only 165F. So I cranked it up to 350 til it was the right temp.  Other than that, it was very good and liked by all. Thx."
64642,106715,2014-05-31,5,So easy!  Tender and delicious.  It&#039;s the first time in a very long time that my sweet baboo asked for seconds!  Definite keeper.
218535,106715,2014-11-02,1,"This is not good at all. Too sweet sauce. For 3 hours of cooking, I want something that taste good."
37449,34011,2005-02-13,5,I will add my 5 stars along with the 28 other people who have enjoyed these fries! Easy and yummy! I used chipoltle powder instead of cayenne. Thanks Sue!
189616,34011,2005-06-12,5,"These were really, really good, what else can I say that 29 others haven't....
Try them you'll like them"
37779,34011,2002-12-09,5,"We dun like diss, yes yeah!! These fries are marvelous Sue. The seasonings are right on!! I doubled the recipe--1 for my husband and 1 for me (he he!!) The kids were just out of luck. Went perfectly with our burger night. Thanks for posting this :D"
32772,34011,2003-05-12,5,"Muy Bien!! These fries were grate. I doubled the recipe and the fries turned out great. I placed the spices as suggested in a plastic bag and took small handfuls and worked through the spice paste. They weren't to spicy and went well with our Mexican Burgers #897 and fresh green beans. We topped the burgers with cheese, salsa and sour cream. Let the salsa and sour cream warm up to room temperature so that it blends well with the warm hamburgers. "
52543,34011,2003-11-09,5,"I rarely eat fried foods so this helped satisfy my craving for ""fish (baked) and chips""!! I had all the ingredients on hand & used a zip lock freezer bag - easy & not messy. Thanx Sue!"
95743,34011,2004-04-26,5,Add me to the list of fans.  Perfect as is.  Wouldn't change a thing.
4470,34011,2004-05-29,5,"Great Flavor they disappeared quickly, doubled the cayenne - just right.  made a half recipe but will keep the spice mix at full recipe size next time I make these.-     when I look at your photo and mine I can tell you had more spice mix on your fries.   I baked them on a pizza stone with no oil whatever came out nice & crispy brown   Thanks again Sue for another great recipe"
26512,34011,2004-06-28,5,"Oh, yeah baby! Great fries! Served these with some great burgers with swiss and a cold beer. The spices are dead on. I added a bit more cayenne and used a zipper bag to coat the fries. Easy clean up with the aluminum foil as well, gotta love that. I poked a tater after 30 minutes and they didn't seem quite crispy enough to suit me, so I just turned on the broiler and crisped them up a bit. A definite keeper, thanks for sharing Sue!"
128473,34011,2005-06-17,5,"We had these tonite for dinner with our baked haddock they were so yummy...Thank you so much for sharing your excelllant recipe Sue. I should tell you that I substituted with sweet potatoes, it was all I had on hand and they turned out great,  naturally sweet and hot and spicy too.
"
98919,34011,2005-07-13,5,These were a hit with me and my hubby!!  (His mother was pure cajun!)  Thanks for Sharing Sue)
142559,34011,2006-08-27,5,"OUTSTANDING taste!! I used frozen fries, only because I was in a pinch for potatoes and this was all I had on hand. I doubled the recipe and these turned out great! Excellent cajun flavor! Very remniscent of food we have when we go visit 'Nawlins!!"
53932,34011,2007-02-01,4,"The spice mix was good, but really quite understated so next time I'd increase by at least half.  My potatoes didn't get as crisp as I would have liked so I will broil next time."
262312,34011,2007-02-02,4,"Great mixture of spices.  I used about 1/4 cup of buffalo wing sauce instead of tabasco as another reviewer suggested.  It added a great kick!  I had to bake 20 more minutes, since my potatoes were still a little raw after 35 minutes at 400 degrees (and I cute them into pretty thin wedges).  Thanks for the great fries recipe!"
50969,34011,2007-02-18,4,"I wanted french fries,but I didn't want all the grease from regular fries.So,I chose these and I'm really glad I did :).I mixed all the ingredients in a plastic zipper bag(for easier clean up:)) My potatoes were sliced really thin and they still weren't done after 30 minutes,so I baked them a little longer.I served them as a side for Recipe#163595.This is a ""keeper"" .Thanks for posting.""Keep Smiling :)"""
251626,34011,2007-03-07,5,"Really, really delicious. They were good with salsa, ranch dressing or kethup. A real keeper. Thanks."
359220,34011,2007-06-14,0,"I deviated a bit from the recipe, so I'd rather not rate using stars, just give details on how I did it.  I used a Penzey's taco seasoning in place of most seasonings listed, garlic salt, a bit of sea salt and some olive oil.  I made a paste like directed and worked a small basket of new potatoes fresh from the farmers mkt.  Cooked at 400 for 30 minutes, not as crispy as I was hoping, but the taste was out of this world...will make using this ""style"" over and over!!!"
358796,34011,2007-08-19,5,"Great flavor, the cooking time is perfect and no clean up when you use the zipper bag and foil. Perfect for an easy weeknight meal, why make frozen french fries when you can make these?"
125640,34011,2008-01-07,3,"I made this exactly as directed except that I didn't peel the potatoes. Didn't have as strong a flavor as I was expecting, but I thought they tasted good. I also like that they were low in fat. DH didn't like them, but I would probably make them again for myself. This would be a nice way to prepare sweet potatoes or zucchini as well. If I make these again I would use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and add a little more salt. Thanks for sharing."
173579,34011,2008-03-02,5,These were fantastic.  Will make again.
140132,34011,2008-12-09,5,Fantastic flavor!  Although I never doubted the flavor with the list of spices but wow we loved these.  Thank you for posting.
252816,34011,2009-01-22,4,I used non stick foil on the cookie sheet..I left the skins on..The fries were tasty...Thank You for this recipe...
280271,34011,2009-02-17,4,These had great flavor but didn't crisp up during the time specified for cooking. These really need to cook longer. We did enjoy the cajun taste. Thanks for posting. :)
844554,34011,2009-02-25,5,"I had some taters I needed to use up so I picked this recipe and am glad I did. It was very, very good. I loved all the mixture of spices. Will make again and again. Thank you."
226863,34011,2009-05-26,5,"These were very zesty, but I wish the directions would specify an ""amount"" of potato, such as so many cups, etc.  or pounds.  What is a medium potato...I think it depends on where you live!  After cooking in the Aussie forum for a while, I chose smaller sized potatoes, and I think the spices overwhelmed the potatoes.  I loved them, but I like fire!!!  But DS thought they were a little too spicy, and a little too limp.  I would suggest crisping them up as previous reviewers have suggested.  I loved the mix of seasonings though.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!"
145352,34011,2009-06-02,5,"Very good! I used 6 potatoes, but didn't increase the paste ingredients and it was great! Made for ZWT 5."
329638,34011,2010-01-19,5,"Delicious!  My fries didn't get quite crispy enough, so I sprayed them with cooking spray and set them under the broiler for a couple minutes, which helped.  Someone mentioned to me once about parboiling the potatoes and patting them dry, then following the cooking method.  I'll have to try that one and see what happens...could be I just need a little more oil (which I was trying to avoid).  We loved the flavor, thanks for posting!"
1269015,34011,2010-02-06,4,"I used sweet potatoes, and left out the tobasco and halved the cayenne. This spice mix is incredible -- I've taken to putting it in my veggie burgers, among other things. The fries always come out really soggy, though--I've taken to baking at 450 for 20-25 minutes and that makes them a *little* better."
33159,34011,2010-03-27,4,Really great flavour!  Easy method!
185446,34011,2010-06-16,4,"These tasted great, but as others noted, weren't very crispy.  Then again, maybe they aren't supposed to be.  Regardless, thank you for a nice variation and easy to make potato side dish."
126440,34011,2010-07-29,4,"These were very good but one side burned, so would either turn down my oven or turn over half way through cooking time or both."
55729,34011,2011-12-16,4,Good mix of seasonings. I omitted the cayenne since some of my family don't like spicy. I think I might cut them a bit thicker next time so they don't burn.
305531,34011,2012-02-21,5,"Awesome fries! My grandson and I were fighting over them, lol. Simple and delish. Thanks Sue Lau for sharing this great keeper. Made for All You Can Cook Buffet Tag."
928301,34011,2012-05-31,4,pretty good.
362983,34011,2013-04-19,5,"Delicious! I made thin wedges and they turned out great. I&#039;d keep an eye on them; mine did take longer than 35 minutes, but they are totally worth the wait! Thanks!"
240552,34011,2014-08-13,5,These were really yummy! I served them with my homemade fry sauce.
894666,34011,2016-08-03,5,"I couldn't get my fries to crisp up which was my bad, I had accidentally added too much oil so I'll have to be careful of that next time, even after 45 minutes they still weren't ready. Placed rack on very top shelf of oven to try to speed it along. Super delicious still, we added a sprinkle of garlic salt and they were wonderful, thanks for giving me a new way to do up potatoes!"
176615,142559,2012-12-03,5,"Very good! The family really enjoyed it. A nice change from plain mac and cheese type casseroles. I loved the addition of spices and tomatoes. As written, this is not too spicy so I'll use 2 fresh jalape?os, minced, and 1/4 t cayenne without worry. This makes a huge 13x9 dish, plenty to feed my family of five at least two meals. So next time, I'll freeze half to bake later. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
218535,99476,2018-10-19,5,Delicious. Won't change a thing.
60992,82102,2004-06-21,5,"This is very very good, and very very easy to make. I made 4 chicken breasts and followed everything else to the letter except that I uncovered it for the last 10 minutes to brown the chiken up and crisp it up again. It was moist and delicious! This will be featured often on our deinner menu!"
128473,82102,2004-07-13,5,"Kittencal thanks so much for recommending this wonderful recipe. It was amazing. The chicken is to die for. It was so easy to make and turned out moist, tender and crisp. Needless to say we loved it. Thanks so much for sharing."
149363,82102,2004-09-15,5,"AWESOME!! This is officially our family's favourite chicken dish.
simple and delicious...thanks!"
26512,82102,2004-09-23,5,"Wonderful baked chicken dish! And incredibly easy to boot! I followed the recipe, but added additional garlic to the butter. Quite a bit more! I also didn't cover this when baking so the chicken would be crispy. I served with a creamy garlic pasta and a glass of Chardonnay and we enjoyed a lovely dinner. This will be a favorite, thanks for sharing!"
74652,82102,2004-10-03,5,This was fantastic!  I am a serious garlic lover and this was just perfect. I made this up ahead of time and put it in the oven when we were ready to eat.  Since I work nights this is something I can prepare and have DH pop in the oven.  Thanks for a great recipe!
47907,82102,2004-10-06,5,All I can sy is YUM!  I made the recipe exactly as posted using the full amount of garlic and I wouldn't change a thing.  I baked at 375º since I was baking something else at the time.  Wonderful garlic flavor and the chicken was very moist.  Thank you for posting this recipe.
52543,82102,2004-10-14,5,"OH MY Kitten - you are the garlic queen & I am your hand maiden! I scaled the recipe for 2 servings, used garlic from our garden & followed your directions exactly - I will do this many times in the future. Thanx for posting this delicious recipe!"
93006,82102,2004-10-16,3,"I'm so sorry but this one didn't hit a home run with us....yes it was moist and garlicky, but although I did use Cajon seasoning in place of the seasoned salt, it didn't pack the punch or crunch we were hoping for."
101034,82102,2004-10-28,5,"I made this chicken for my two neighbors who are both in their late 80's. Neither one of them have been feeling that good and I was afraid they weren't eating properly.
I made four breasts, so they would have two meals, but I wanted to taste it so badly, so I cut off alittle of each end of each breast (I had to make them look uniform). I was so glad I chose this recipe for them.....it's absolutely delicious. It was so tender and moist and loaded with flavor. I was out of bread crumbs, so I put some butter flavored crackers into my food processor and they worked perfectly. The chicken was loved by all and I'll be making it again for DH and myself. Thanks KITTENCAL....This is a definite keeper."
18391,82102,2004-11-02,5,"This is very good! Made exactly as stated, but scaled down for two .. I have also tried it with bone-in chicken and it requires a little more baking time .. Thanks for sharing!"
92886,82102,2006-02-07,4,I enjoyed this.  It was quite easy to prepare and had a good garlic flavor.  I think for people like me who are always looking for simple weekenight meals this is worth a try.
35526,82102,2004-12-13,5,Mine looked nothing like the picture.  Not sure why.  Tasted GREAT.  We loved the flavors and how the breast remained moist.  I served with roasted potatoes.  I will be making this one again.
68960,82102,2005-01-22,5,Fabulous recipe. Very moist and delicious. I took Kooka advise and increased the breadcrumb mix also uncovered it in the last 10 minutes. Thanks!
59473,82102,2005-02-01,5,"This was nice and cheesy, garlicky and very moist. I used 3 chicken breasts but kept the amounts of the other ingredients the same as the recipe stated. Like a lot of other reviewers I uncovered it for about 10 minutes to let it crisp. Thanks for a great recipe."
173579,82102,2005-02-11,5,"Excellent recipe.  Very cheesy.  My family liked this very much.  Keep bringing on those wonderful recipes, Kittencal."
158086,82102,2005-08-11,5,This recipe was great!  I have to agree to double the butter and breadcrumb mixtures but other than that it was amazing!
184723,82102,2005-10-05,5,"Delicious!  I was short on time and only had frozen chicken breasts... so I poured the butter mixture over the breasts and made sure some was underneath, doubled the bread crumb mixture as others suggested and poured on top as well trying to coat as best I could.  Turned out PERFECT!!!! Thanks!"
140806,82102,2005-11-29,5,"I made this for DH on a whim. He raved about the moist chicken all evening! I left the cheddar out of the bread crumb mix and topped the chicken with thin slices of sharp cheese. I also modified the recipe by using chicken tenders-they cooked much faster, about 30 minutes in the oven. This recipe is going into regular rotation for DH starting today! Thanks KITTENCAL!"
146047,82102,2005-12-17,5,"Kittencal, this is some very tasty chicken. I used panko bread crumbs, romano rather than parmesan, and all fresh garlic rather than part powdered. A previous reviewer said it worked well to use the crumb and cheese mixture as a topping, which is how I did it too to save time. Delicious!"
230557,82102,2006-07-05,4,Good garlic flavor but I had quite a bit of trouble getting the coating to stay on the chicken.  Thanks!
169969,82102,2006-08-09,5,"Everyone enjoyed this recipe. Since the cheddar was already grated I threw all the breading ingredients into the food processor and let it whirl. This really made the ingredients evenly distributed and the cheese a finer grate. This dish is also surprisingly kid friendly, as our 4 year old ate every last bite. I had a good amount of the garlic butter left over and poured it on top of the breasts...next time I will cut down on the amount of butter. I served it with corn on the cob and zucchini oven fries. Thank you Kitz for yet another wonderful dinner. "
92816,82102,2006-11-01,4,This is a very tasty way to cook chicken.I used 2 chicken breasts so I cut most of the ingredients in half.Like another reviewer had suggested next time I would remove the foil halfway through to make the dressing a bit more crispy.Very tasty dish!
229524,82102,2006-11-26,5,WOW! This was so good.  The flavor was outstanding and the chicken was soooo moist.  This will become oone of our top 10 favorites.  The chicken looks so pretty when it's done.  Thanks Kittencal :)
227607,82102,2007-01-03,5,WOW!!!!it is not often that we have a meal that everyone(all 7 of us including some kids that are pretty picky lately) loves.  I made this chicken with corn and mashed potatoes.  I pounded the chicken out thin then followed the directions except for using shredded cheese instead of grated cheese.  I cooked it the last 10 minutes uncovered.  I also made up extra butter garlic mixture and put in a spray bottle.  The last 10 minutes I sprayed it over the chicken(did not want it totally wet...just more of the wonderful butter/garlic flavor) and used what was left in my mashed potatoes.  This meal was to die for.
51011,82102,2007-01-05,4,"I was looking for something easy to have for dinner upon returning from our vacation.  I had just about everything to make this, and I am glad I did.  I only made 2 changes- 1. I used chicken tenders- 2. I added some basil in the mix.  I agree that you need more of the coating, so I would suggest you double that, but other than that, everything was good.  Thanks for sharing!"
331557,82102,2007-03-03,4,This was enjoyed in our house.  I did take the cover off the chicken for the last 10 minutes to crisp it up a bit as per suggestions in the comments and it worked beautifully.  Thank you for sharing.
187373,82102,2007-04-19,4,"Don't think this needs another review, but this was delicious and easy to make.  Thanks kittencal for another great recipe!"
50969,82102,2007-04-23,4,"I don't know what else that can be said about this recipe,that hasn't already been said.Except that I will make this again,it's a recipe that we all enjoyed very much.Thanks for posting,""Keep Smiling:)"""
358796,82102,2007-05-04,4,"Good, but not really for my family's tastes. This might be good if you have picky eaters who like basic chicken and cheese dishes. Not a bad recipe, just probably won't make again."
124190,82102,2007-05-07,4,"This was really good. DH liked it, which was a plus. I love the intense garlic flavor. It was very easy to make. My chicken took about an hour to cook, so maybe they were larger than the recipe indicated. I did love the taste, and I will definitely make these again. Thanks for a great recipe!"
265954,82102,2007-06-28,5,"Kittencal, you have done it again.  This is delicious!  I love the way the garlic and the cheese work together to make this great tasting topping.  One suggestion, though:  use 3/4 cup dry bread crumbs to coat the chicken.  Thanks for posting this keeper of a recipe!"
520150,82102,2007-07-05,4,"This was very good.  We served this for dinner guests.  Turned out very moist.  I think I will try the mozzarella version next.
Thank you very much for  a wonderful recipe."
407007,82102,2007-07-08,5,"wow oh wow was this ever good! if I could give more than five stars, I would! I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of using light cheeses and butter) and this came out fantastic! the chicken was very moist and no flavor overpowered it more than the other, just a nice blend of all of them. my hubby has said we can have this chicken every week, so thank you so much for a keeper!!"
231054,82102,2007-08-29,5,"Kitten, your recipes always excite me!!!  This was a fantastic dish.  I used the amount of garlic called for (both fresh and powdered) and it was sensational.  My breast pieces were fairly large - but I had plenty of crumb mixture.  I used ALL the butter mixture.  I thought about only making half the recipe since its just myself and my husband -- but did the entire 4 pieces -- and I'm glad I did.  I plan on using the remaining two to make a Chicken Parmesean dish.  I've wanted to try this recipe for quite some time -- and now that we've had it, it was definitely worth the wait -- but we won't be waiting long to have it again!!!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  From the number of ratings you've gotten,  I'd say you've provided a delicious dinner for lots and lots of people."
632249,82102,2007-11-04,5,"As my daughter said ""Mom, you gotta make this again!!""  We all really liked this.  Next time, I will add a bit more cheese to the top of the breasts during the last 10 minutes. Thanks so much Kittencal!"
400420,82102,2007-11-06,5,"Awesome flavor!  Followed the directions exactly, except I only used 2 large chicken breast halves, and cut those up into quarters, so I had 8 smaller pieces.  I subbed wheat germ for 1/2 of the bread crumbs (no one can ever tell the difference). I love lemon and will definitely add some next time! Thank you so much for another great recipe!!"
140132,82102,2007-11-12,4,Really good recipe.  These held there juices in and tasted great.  They were easy to prepare and had good flavor....thank you Kittencal for another yummy recipe....Stephanie
318235,82102,2007-11-13,5,Delicious! No further description needed. Thank you KittenCal
125640,82102,2007-11-30,5,Easy and yummy. Very moist and tender with lots of flavour. The only thing I did different was to sub mozarella for the cheddar so I didn't have to run to the store. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed brocolli. A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing.
136997,82102,2007-12-03,5,"Oh wow Carol! This is awesome chicken. So moist and flavorful. My husband loved it, as did I of course. The only thing I did was to half the recipe. :)"
529278,82102,2007-12-19,5,"I have never had such moist chicken before!  This recipe had simple, straight-forward instructions and wouldn't have taken much time if we would have had breadcrumbs on hand.  Instead we had to make them in the middle, so that took a bit.  We did put cheese on the top for the last 5 minutes.  Used a 4 cheese blend that we had on hand.  Our breasts were good sized, and we had to make a bit more of the crumb mixture, but we had just enough of the butter mix.  This chicken is definitely worthy of company!"
666723,82102,2007-12-29,5,"How do I rate higher than 5 stars? :)  I melted the butter in a small saucepan with the minced garlic and garlic powder for 10 minutes to really infuse the butter.  I love garlic!  You must definitely use a food processor to mix the bread crumbs, and both of the cheeses as it mixes so well and just creates the most yummy, flavorfull mixture of all time!  I cut 2 breasts into strips before cooking and had just enough of the mixture.  They were so tasty and I of course added some tobasco to the butter and some cayenne to the bread/cheese mix.  I left these uncovered for 25 minutes in a 400 degree oven and they were the best chicken strips I've ever made!  Don't be afraid to add extra garlic and extra cheddar cheese!"
240552,82102,2008-01-01,5,Superb and easy! I used regular breadcrumbs and only 1 T of garlic. Thanks for the great recipe! It is now a family favorite!  This recipe made it into our book#179809!
168462,82102,2008-01-19,5,"This was fantastic. I had four huge chicken breasts and took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the coating. I had some left over, but not too much. For the size of chicken breasts I used, I think about 1 1/2 times the amount of coating would be perfect. I used about half the garlic  listed and it was perfect for us. This was very easy to make and does result in very moist chicken. My boys and husband loved this and were disappointed that I did not make a double batch. I love recipes like this, which are not a lot of work, but the results are superb. Thanks for the recipe."
198154,82102,2008-02-12,4,"Made this for DH, he said that it was good. He did comment on how moist the chicken was.  I am sure that he will want me to make this again."
286851,82102,2008-03-08,3,"I thought this dish was easy to make, and the chicken came out extremely moist and juicy. I used 2T of garlic (we do love garlic), but I think it ended up being too much. The garlic flavor overshadowed any cheddar flavor--I couldn't detect the cheese at all. Though I uncovered while baking, the crust wasn't as crisp as I would have liked. I will probably make this again, as my husband liked it, but I will try to play with it a bit first. Thanks for sharing."
774665,82102,2008-03-21,5,This was so good! I didn't change a thing and everyone ate every last bite. My five year olds are getting picky about food but they LOVED this chicken. It was tasty and moist. Thank you for another winner!
207176,82102,2008-03-30,5,This was a winner with the family and it was so easy and quick to make.  I doubled everything because I made 2 packages of thinly sliced breasts.  I followed your recipe and it was juicy inside and crispy outside.  I served it with steamed  broccoliflower and salad.  I also sauted some mushrooms but only the DH and I had that. It was a perfect Sunday night dinner that didn't require too much of my energy! Thanks again!
218535,82102,2008-04-21,4,"This is very eay and delciious. I used 6 boneless, skinless chicken thights and baked them for 35 minutes."
242484,82102,2008-04-24,5,"We all truly enjoyed this!  So moist, so easy, so perfect!  I will be repeating this one over & over!"
620763,82102,2008-04-25,5,So delicious!  Chicken is full of flavor and comes out really moist.
470351,82102,2008-05-22,5,Excellent and moist breaded chicken!  I went by other reviewers comments that the breading wasn't enough and doubled the breading and the butter/garlic mixture.  You definitely needed more breading but I could have stuck with the original amount of the butter/garlic mixture and still had enough.  I used a lot more garlic than it called for and did not add the extra mozzarella at the end.  The cooking time of 30-35 minutes was spot on....the chicken was cooked perfectly and ultra moist.  We'll definitely make this one again.  Thanks for another great one Kittencal!
262312,82102,2008-07-10,5,"great recipe.  i added some fresh parsley to the breadcrumbs, i used panko breadcrumbs that i seasoned myself... other than that, i followed the recipe exactly.  i loved all the cheese in the breadcrumbs, it really looked nice when i pulled it out of the oven.  also, if you top the chicken with your leftover breadcrumbs, it really does adhere during baking, i strongly suggest doing that!  anyway, thanks for another winner, kitten!"
126104,82102,2008-07-15,3,"I'm so sorry, but this was very bland to me.  Maybe more salt--note sure.  I used a little over the suggested garlic.  The chicken wasn't done, and I put it in the oven to continue cooking on very low for about an hour, and it was still a little raw.

I'm not sure what happened, but it was just not what I expected."
251917,82102,2008-09-12,5,Made for the ABC cookbook tag: Carol - delicious and easy!! We all loved this dish - the meat was juicy and full of flavor!
38643,82102,2008-10-05,4,Very good. This chicken is so moist.  I will be making it again.
426903,82102,2008-11-03,5,Very cheesy chicken. We enjoyed it very much. I had some large chicken breasts so I cut them in half to make sure they cooked all the way through. I still had to add about 10 minutes. Thanks for posting Kitten!
368078,82102,2008-11-05,5,"This was wonderful!!  The only change we made was to use shredded Parmesan cheese instead of grated.  We only used 2 chicken breast, and it took 30 minutes to bake.  The chicken was very moist.  We plan to make this recipe again and again.  Thanks Kittencal!"
969481,82102,2008-11-08,5,"Wonderful flavor! The chicken was very moist and the garlic flavor was just heavenly. The only issue I had (by my own fault) was I used too much breading, so the crust turned out tasting more of breadcrumbs and less of cheese. The next time I make this I will be sure to lightly coat only once. Thanks for antoher great recipe!"
203111,82102,2008-12-06,5,"Oh, my goodness, this is the very best chicken breast I have ever had in my life!!!  I scaled it to serve 1 and baked in my little toaster oven for 35 min. and it's perfect.  Done, yet moist and juicy.  And, oh, so tasty!  The only down side is that I no longer want my chicken breast fixed any other way but this.   Thanks Kittencal for a real winner!"
226863,82102,2008-12-07,5,Very good!  It was very moist and tastey.  I will definitely make this again.
357358,82102,2008-12-18,5,Delicious with mashed potatoes and a tossed salad. Comfort food squared! Thanks Kittencal.
847160,82102,2008-12-27,5,delicious
191533,82102,2009-04-17,5,"Ahhh-mazing. To serve 3 of us, I left all ingredients the same but used 2 chicken breast halves, each cut in half. I could have eaten twice as much! (I did have too much coating and butter for that small amount of chicken.)"
185446,82102,2009-07-09,5,"Easy enough for after work weekday meals, yet elegant enough for company.  As usual, Kittencal comes through again.  What would RecipeZaar do without you?"
76951,82102,2011-06-26,0,5 stars!  I used Panko and it came out crispy outside and moist inside.  Great recipe.
540346,82102,2011-06-27,5,This chicken was fantastic and moist.  I used a smoked cheddar which only added to the delightfulness.
637486,82102,2009-08-24,5,This is a fabulous recipe!  My husband said that this was the best chicken he has ever had!  I used 2 large breasts that I cut in half lengthwise and the butter/breading mixture was just the right amount.  I omitted the cheese at the end and they came out so moist and flavorful.  They were so tender that you don't even need a knife to cut the chicken.  Thanks for posting!
879716,82102,2009-10-20,5,Loved this so much that I ate the cold leftover breast like a big cookie while driving to work the next morning... ha ha.  Yum!
486718,82102,2009-10-27,5,"Yummy!!  Very good, quick and easy which makes it a keeper.
Thanks!"
482376,82102,2009-12-28,5,"Easy and delicious! I do something similar to this but it doesn't include the cheddar cheese nor does it call for as much garlic. I loved this version. The chicken remains tender while the coating crisps up nicely. It's full of flavor, too. Thanks for another great recipe!"
55729,82102,2010-01-03,4,"This was easy to do and I thought it turned out well. My kitchen is so cold that the butter mixture didn't stay melted, so I had a bit of trouble getting it on the chicken! I used whole wheat seasoned bread crumbs (4C is making them now). I was a bit surprised that the cheddar cheese didn't melt, but it had been in the freezer, so maybe that was it. Everyone seemed to like this so I would probably make it again."
1269015,82102,2010-01-05,0,"I used this as inspiration for a tofu recipe, and it was incredible -- a nice change from the usual Asian-style tofu recipe. Thanks for sharing, Kittencal!"
37779,82102,2010-01-31,3,"This got a very mediocre reaction from me and my family. Yes, the chicken was very tender. However, we thought the flavor was lacking and the crumb coating was not crisp, but rather sludgy. Changes I would make--use Panko crumbs, add chopped fresh herbs and the idea of adding lemon juice to the garlic butter mixture would probably amp up the flavor. Always appreciate a new recipe to try, so thanks."
1581225,82102,2010-08-17,5,"Yummy way to cook chicken breasts. Nice and garlicky, reminded me of chicken kiev."
1133190,82102,2010-09-19,5,Very good and pretty easy to make!  My husband is not a big baked chicken person but he kept telling me how much he liked it.  We love garlic so this was perfect for us.  And I've never had a more moist baked chicken!  I didn't add cheese on top at the end but will try it next time.  Thanks so much for such a great recipe!!
810787,82102,2010-10-25,5,The difference has to be the butter. I've made something very similar but with an egg wash....the result was DRY chicken. This is NOT dry and is full of flavor!!
15521,82102,2011-03-23,5,Very good and flavorful.  I tried cooking it on a rack in a pan (I used my cooling rack) and they came out nice and crisp.  Cooked thick chicken breasts for 40 minutes and they were juicy and perfect.
389431,82102,2011-04-04,4,"The flavor was fantastic, but mine came out soggy...  I'm going to play around with different ways to crisp it up a bit...  Keeper for flavor for sure though!!  Thanks!"
97579,82102,2011-08-31,5,"This was amazing!  I didn't add the cheese at the end and it was perfect.  So easy to make ahead of time too!  I made it in the morning, kept in fridge and cooked for dinner.  Enjoyed by all and will definitely make again!"
2041603,82102,2011-10-25,5,Superb recipe!
456858,82102,2011-11-03,3,"This was just OK 4 me.  Not  bad, but wasn't great either.  Probably would not make again."
377039,82102,2012-01-11,4,"Tender and moist, with good flavor. I will add the shredded cheese at the end next time. I used two large boneless breasts, and had to bake for an hour before it was even close to done. I cooked it on a rack and it did not get very crispy, but it was tasty. This might be even better if the chicken were cut-up into large bites. We enjoyed it and I will probably make again."
33159,82102,2012-02-13,5,"Oh...my...  good...  heavens...  This is amazing!!!  Fantastic flavour, meat is so moist & the coating is nice & crunchy!!  As I was adding all the garlicky ingredients, I was thinking there was no way my hubby was going to like it but he did, too!!"
126440,82102,2012-04-14,4,Loved the garlic flavor but didn't get as crisp as I thought it should.  Cooked it on a rack so maybe if I use less butter next time it would work.
400708,82102,2014-03-09,4,Love all of your recipes so decided to give this a try.  It was so easy &amp; very good.  I placed mine on a rack over the pan to bake &amp; this gave a lovely crisp coating with no mushy bottom.  Followed your suggestion of topping with marinara sauce &amp; mozzarella cheese in the last few minutes.  Served over fettuccine noodles &amp; served with a fresh garden salad.  Lovely dinner in a short amount of time
350750,82102,2014-05-22,4,"These were easy to make, and enjoyed by the family.  Thank you!"
280271,82102,2018-08-15,5,With so many yummy reviews you can't go wrong with this dish...it's easy and tasty...thanks for sharing your recipe...
13796,47195,2003-02-13,5,I love them! I've made them a few times now.. and I prefer seasoned salt on mine.
49304,47195,2003-04-04,5,"Oh My, these are great, I used my microwave bacon tray and a microwave lid(made from the same thing that the bacon tray is made of) I found that I didn't have to cook them as long only 4 minutes 15 seconds,probably because of the lid. They are great, very light brown and crisp.Didn't use any oil & just lightly salted them. My DH sliced them with the meat slicer. DH Loves chips, these are so good and so much better for him. I sent the recipe on to others so they may enjoy them too. Thank you SOOooo very much Uncle Bill.
Barb"
73469,47195,2003-04-05,5,These were great potatoes.  I loved them. I can't believe that these actually turned out.  Their really good for someone like me who is on weight watchers.  Thanks for the recipe!
26512,47195,2003-05-13,5,"Wow! What more can I say, Uncle Bill? These are absolutely delicious! I just seasoned mine with salt and cooked them on a plate. A few stuck, but no big deal. Just amazing, I just can't believe you can make chips in a microwave! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!"
59473,47195,2003-05-31,5,These chips were absolutely delicious. I will be making these again and again. Thanks
35526,47195,2003-06-14,5,"After several lame, limp batches I finally got the timing right in my retro microwave, circa 1979 or 80.  12 minutes was perfect.  I used some cajun spice and they were very crisp and good."
64934,47195,2004-03-24,5,"There isn't much more I can add to all these wonderful reviews!  I've been making these chips for the past year and just realized today, that I've never reviewed them!! :(

I also put a piece of parchment paper on a plate, and don't use any   oil.  I just sprinkle the potatoes with a bit of salt and they turn out wonderful! Thanks for this great recipe, Uncle Bill!  Sorry the review is a bit late!"
37305,47195,2003-10-26,5,"Well, Uncle Bill, this is a ""trying to be healthy"" person's dream snack!  The casserole method didn't work for me (they stuck terribly), so I looked deeper into my cabinets and found my rarely used microwave bacon rack.  This worked perfectly!  My microwave is very powerful so I only needed 6 minutes for perfect chips.  I tried plain salted and then onion powder, salt and parsley ... these were a favorite.  I plan on trying some dry ranch dip mix on them next time!  Thanks for sharing this ...I have already shared it with my ""diet buddies""!  (My only regret is that you can only make a few at a time and my kids keep eating them!)"
27643,47195,2003-11-18,5,"Well, I don't know what more can be said!! I finally got around to making these. Fantastic!! Very fresh, very crisp, so much better that the fatty ones. I love this recipe!! Thanks Uncle Bill! "
36944,47195,2004-02-10,5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  These are great!  I'll go heavier on my spices next time.  And the thinner I sliced them, the better I liked them!  Thanks for sharing your recipe Uncle Bill!"
68960,47195,2004-02-16,5,"So very easy and can be made to individual tastes.  I really enjoy garlic salt and cayenne pepper.  Thankyou Uncle Bill, another happy fan here."
132764,47195,2004-03-25,5,"I can't believe it's potato chips! But it is. The real thing. I'm a chip snob, and I almost didn't post because there are so many reviews... but! I did notice something. The thinner they are, the longer they need to cook. Weird but true. This may explain the differing times (aside from the different microwave power). Something to ponder..."
104295,47195,2004-06-22,5,"Like this needs a 76th review, but I want to chime in that I too loved these.  We made plain chips and Old Bay chips and they were great.  We tried salt and vinegar and were not very successful in getting a strong vinegar taste.  Next time I may soak them in vinegar.  But a great low-fat snack.  Perfect for those of us on Weight Watchers!"
37868,47195,2004-10-13,5,I know you have heard this over and over but you have done a great job for telling us about these chips. I have been staying away from those over priced and over salted chips for long long time. Now I can have them anytime. Fresh ... Healthly ... and a Great taste. Thank You for the recipe and the fun at making them. Hugs
182624,47195,2005-04-21,5,"These are an awesome snack!  I think I might actually prefer them to store-bought chips!!  I put garlic salt on them - YUM!  Next time I'll do kosher salt.  Mine took much longer than 5 minutes; I'm not sure just how long because I kept adding 20 seconds, but I'd guess around 7 minutes.  I have a feeling it just depends how thin you cut the potatoes.  I'm not very good at cutting super thin, so that's probably why it took a bit longer.  Anyhoo ... these are a yummy and fairly healthy snack that I will be making again and again!  THANKS for sharing!"
189616,47195,2005-05-07,5,"3 potatoes later my two DS's wanted more! Russet potatoes work best for this, meatier and dryer than the others. My next online spice order will include spices for these (barbecue, sour cream onion and salt and vinegar) so my boys can specify which flavor they want. Tasted like Kettle Cooked Chips.
Thanks for a fantastic post TexasKelly!"
203111,47195,2005-05-08,5,"Thank you for a great recipe, TexasKelly! I used a slicer for very thin slices and still  needed to microwave them for about 8 minutes for a full plate of chips, so apparently times vary according to your microwave. They turn a beautiful golden brown when done.   "
53932,47195,2005-07-04,5,"Yes indeed, these are just great!  I tried them with Tony Chacere's, with Cavender's Greek Seasoning and with plain old salt.  They tasted good no matter what I sprinkled them with.  I served them with Pan Fried Onion Dip (#126209).   Thank you."
232480,47195,2005-09-11,2,I wanted to like these...I really did.  I found that I couldn't microwave them for longer than 4 minutes or they were so black and burned they tasted like charcoal.  At 4 minutes they were still too charred for my taste but edible.  Under that they weren't done.  Maybe it's my microwave.  I tried them with several different seasonings and didn't really care for any of them.  Sorry. :(
103876,47195,2005-10-08,5,"I have been wanting to try this recipe for a long time, but just didn't get around to it.  Well today was the day and to my delight, they turned out great!  I am surprised that they turned out so crisp after just 5 minute in the microwave and the flavor is rich and hearty.  I will definitely make these again."
248023,47195,2005-11-30,5,"This recipe doesn't really need another 5 star rating but... I was craving some chips to eat with a ham & swiss sandwich (leftover from Thanksgiving!) but didn't want to go out.  So I checked out this recipe since it had gotten so many rave reviews, and I am so glad I did.  They turned out wonderfully crispy and tasty.  I love the taste of vinegar & salt chips so I soaked the slices in a little apple cider vinegar before I placed them on the plate to cook.  I patted them dry and sprinkled a little kosher salt on them and cooked them for about 7 minutes.  I was so excited about making these chips that I didn't even realize I was supposed to cover them and they still turned out great. Great recipe that is so easy, low fat and tasty!"
329638,47195,2006-10-17,5,"As the wife of a dedicated snacker and the mother of three children who take after their father, I am always searching for recipes that are healthier versions of the foods my family loves.  OMG, this recipe is a winner!
I found it about 15 minutes ago, and have the second batch in the microwave (for myself this time!), and the family is still clamoring around the counter watching the microwave timer!  Thanks for such an amazing (and healthy!) recipe!"
316717,47195,2007-01-17,5,yup it worked. brushed olive oil on the plate n' sprinkled w/ salt. i actually like it crispy w/ a little softness to it better than really crispy. u just have to watch the potatoes to make sure they don't burn.
60989,47195,2007-03-13,5,"I have been meaning to try these for years, and finally did last night. I was not disappointed. Very easy and very tasty. This cured my cravings for potato chips in a healthy way. Thanks!"
520150,47195,2007-08-02,5,"I can't believe I haven't posted a review!  I couldn't tell you how many times I have made these.  It's funny, but whenever I find a spice mixture we like (for chicken, veggies, whatever) I will try it on these potato chips as well!  I have even dipped them in vinegar & salted.  Pretty good!  I don't bother w/ the olive oil, I just cook them for 3 minutes, then lift each one from the tray & cook them one last minute.  No sticking & no extra olive oil calories!  Thanks so, so much for sharing this recipe!"
39301,47195,2007-09-06,5,"Fantastic!  I kept it simple and just seasoned with garlic salt - the whole family loved them.

Thanks for posting!"
632249,47195,2007-11-27,3,I tried this recipe at least 8 times and I can't seem to get it right.  The best batch I had went soggy after I cooled and put in a sealed container (even though it was only a few  hours since I had made them.)  Can these be stored or do you need to consume right away?  I am desperate to get this right because I am a potato chip nut! Thx.
377581,47195,2007-11-27,4,"I used garlic powder, sesoning salt, and pepper. I did a single layer on the bacon tray for the first batch at it burned at 7 minutes, so I put more slices in the second batch and it was better. Thanks for posting."
439797,47195,2008-02-29,5,"Took no more than 7.5 minutes. But I'm going to try just 7 next time. My husband loved them. What a fun recipe!

I'm updating to add that this is the absolute best recipe I've ever found on recipezaar.  We make these almost every day.  I've tried all kinds of different pototates.  Love to use sweet potatoes!"
121185,47195,2008-04-21,2,"These didn't turn out so great....tasted burnt but didn't look it.,"
195589,47195,2008-06-19,5,"As if this needs another review, but I just tried them and they are SOOOO good! I used the parchment paper, sprayed it lightly, added some garlic powder, sea salt and a smidge of pepper. I cooked them for 6 minutes on high. Put out sour cream and ketchup as condiments. Yumm! Thanks for posting."
371738,47195,2009-01-28,5,Simply fantastic!  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and omitted the oil and just placed the slices on parchment paper and they were perfect.  Thank you!
242484,47195,2009-02-28,0,"I'm not going to rate theis because obviously with all the 5 star ratings, this must be a great recipe.  it must have been my technique that didn't work.  I think I had better stick to buying my chips from good ol' Lays!"
140132,47195,2009-03-24,5,These are YUMMY!!!  I loved them and tried different seasonings on them.  I will make these again for lunches.  Thank you so much for posting.
187373,47195,2009-04-29,4,"These were pretty good.  I did have trouble with mine sticking, even though I used oil.  Mine certainly didn't look like the picture; maybe I need a little more practice!  Thanks for posting!"
333017,47195,2009-05-03,0,"Bill, I really wanted to like these chips...but after 10 minutes, they were still not cooked, and that was for 1 potatoe.  I used parchment paper...cut it to fit my microwave...sprayed it with cooking spray and spread the chips out.  I even used a pizza paddle to place the chips in the microwave.  If I had not seen the picture, I would not have believed that they could be crisp.  I will try them again and cook them longer, but if I am doing one potato at a time, this could be a long porcedure if I am doing 4!!!"
188119,47195,2009-07-24,5,"Pretty good recipe. I burned them a bit the first time, but after that they came out fine. Thanks!"
312577,47195,2009-10-06,5,Excellent!!!  I made for my BF who is on a diet.  I used ranch dressing seasoning and parchment paper with Pam spray.
768828,47195,2010-01-09,5,"These are the best ever.  I tried another recipe that I thought was really good, but these are so much easier plus being awesome.  On the other recipe I had to turn the chips over, which was a pain, plus it used more oil.  Thank you so much for sharing a great recipe."
92816,47195,2010-04-02,5,"Like alot of reviewers here I was skeptical about a crispy potato chip in the microwave.But it really works,it's amazing  :) They do get brown and crispy.The first batch I made was salt and pepper.The next batch I added garlic powder to the salt and pepper which was even better."
145352,47195,2011-08-29,4,"Not quite potato chip-y, but good."
400420,47195,2012-09-07,0,"Love these!  I've made them twice now, and both times I've skipped the soaking step and used the parchment paper method, allowing me to use the entire turn table in the microwave to place the potatoes on (the only microwave safe dishes I have are much smaller, so would limit the number of chips I can cook at a time).  I re-spray the parchment each batch, and definitely reduce the number of minutes to cook each batch.  First batch took 10 minutes, down to about 6 minutes for the 5th or 6th batch.  I just used salt and pepper.  I was considering making them for a BBQ tomorrow, but I think it would take way too long to cook enough batches for 15 people (I can eat almost 2 whole potatoes worth just by myself if I'm not careful!).  Potato chips are one of my weaknesses, so I'm really happy to have an almost guilt free way to eat them!  Thank you!"
126440,47195,2013-05-30,5,"Made half a recipe but each batch took 71/2 min. as I had used my food processor to slice the potatoes.  It is 2mm, I believe.  May have to get a different blade so they are thinner.  Serving with Recipe #34683 later today."
60992,71739,2004-07-13,5,"Wonderful recipe! This rice has subtle flavors that would compliment anything it was served with. The directions are clear and easy to follow. The only change I would do is to cut the onion in larger pieces so it has a little ""crunch"". A most definite keeper!"
37636,71739,2004-08-19,5,"Fantastic recipe! Easy to make and the rice cooks perfectly. I did add 1/4 tsp of ground turmeric to mine in addition to s&p and it gave just a bit more color, which was very nice. This will be a regular in my collection! Thanks for posting!"
93006,71739,2005-04-15,5,"Easy, tasty, and only requires things you most likely have on hand - what more could you ask for?  My 11 YO loved it, and it was indeed a nice change from ""regular"" rice."
278113,71739,2006-01-11,5,"This was fantastic! My daughter who despises garlic AND onions, asked for seconds!!LOL
We will make this often, thanks for sharing!"
269331,71739,2006-08-07,5,I wanted a quick and easy recipe to jazz up plain white rice.  This really fit the bill!
8688,71739,2006-09-06,5,"Exceptionally  flavorful! This recipe needs no gravy or anything else for that matter, to give it flavor.  The garlic and onion cooking along with the chicken broth provide all the flavor this rice needs!  Definitely a make-again recipe!  Thanks so much, Bergy!"
53932,71739,2006-10-07,5,"Very good rice dish.  I added a little garlic salt at the end as I used a low sodium chicken broth.  Thanks for sharing, Bergy."
124249,71739,2006-10-11,5,"Made this as a side dish to go with steak. It was very good and quick to fix. Nice change from potatoes.

Thanks Bergy.

Bullwinkle. "
187373,71739,2006-11-21,3,This recipe was okay. I agree that it did need a little salt. It was just a little bland for our tastes. Thanks for the recipe though.
331557,71739,2007-03-03,5,We liked this very much.  I did add 5 cloves of garlic and didn't have the bay leaf and it still turned out great.  Thank you for sharing.
51011,71739,2007-03-07,4,"I made this tonight to go with some salmon I was making.  I loved the taste, but found that I had to add an extra half cup of water to get it to cook down.  Thanks for sharing the recipe :)"
229524,71739,2007-03-25,5,Nice flavor and easy to make.
182624,71739,2007-05-06,4,Great and easy rice dish.  A keeper for sure!
47907,71739,2007-08-06,5,This rice was very good and easy to make.  It really dresses up plain white rice nicely.  I am sure that we will be having this recipe many times in the future.  Thanks for posting a keeper!
248023,71739,2007-08-15,4,"Just a great, tasty and easy side dish that was really light and well seasoned.  I think next time I will add more garlic as I am a garlic lover!  I didn't have any dried thyme so I just used 3 fresh sprigs from my garden and placed it in the rice along with the bay leaf.  I didn't even have to bother taking it off the stem or chopping since all the little leaves fall off during the cooking process.  Just removed them along with the bay leaf at the end.  Loved the parsley!!!  I served this with Recipe #82969 and steamed broccoli... Thanks for posting!!!"
632249,71739,2007-10-30,3,This was just ok for us.  The kids did not like at all.
666723,71739,2008-01-21,5,"This was outstanding!  I usually make my rice with chicken broth, but last night I wanted to add something extra!  I also added 2 dashes of cayenne pepper and a dash of cinnamon to go with the chicken that I was serving with this rice (Simple Caribbean Jerk Chicken #33170)... the rice was great with the sauce from the chicken too, and I will make this more often!  Thanks!"
140132,71739,2008-01-28,5,This is delicious.  I love rice and this recipe is no exception. So good. Thank you for this easy and tasty recipe....STephanie
101823,71739,2008-03-06,4,"I omitted the bay leaf and chopped parsley, but otherwise prepared this as written with basamati rice.  It was an excellent side with recipe #43914."
386849,71739,2008-05-12,3,We liked this rice- thanks!
189616,71739,2008-07-10,5,Great rice dish-I used the dried roasted garlic. This was Soooo good my eldest DS ate the rest out of the fry pan.
359220,71739,2008-07-26,4,"Very tasty rice, but DH and I were hoping for more of a garlicky flavor.  As it was, just a nicely seasoned rice that would go with almost any main dish.  I did have to cook mine about 5 minutes longer otherwise we would have still been crunching on rice!  Thanks for the recipe Bergy!"
470351,71739,2009-01-17,5,Really great!  One of the few rice dishes that turned out perfectly for me.  I paired this tonight with blackened salmon and roasted cauliflower.  I increased the garlic and forgot the parsley.  Turned out the perfect consistency.  Will definitely make this one again.
439797,71739,2009-05-19,5,yummy and easy!
489552,71739,2009-06-16,5,"I love rice and I'm always looking for new recipes. Well this one will be 1 of my new recipes! :) This was great and easy. It is the easiest of recipes that are always worth making over and over. Thank you so Bergy :)
Update: 06/16/09
I was browzing reviews today, I saw this rice recipe, and as it mentions above  am always on the look out for rice recipe.  Anyhow, so I click on recipe and see that I had posted a review with no stars!!! :o Now how did that happen?  I am so so sorry Bergy I had no idea this had happened.
Here are the stars that are well deserved :)"
250031,71739,2009-07-27,5,This was excellent; I could have eaten it all! I used Bouquet Garni instead of thyme and bay leaf (just not a big thyme fan). It cooked up perfectly in the time allotted.  Thank you for posting!
532289,71739,2009-11-02,4,This was pretty good.  Made as directed except I left out the parsley because my kids wouldn't have eaten it.  I served this with Pork Chops Yum-Yum by Brad Beckwith  also on this site.  With a side of green beans we had a complete meal compliments of Zaar.  I'll make again.  Thanks for sharing.
1269015,71739,2010-09-02,3,"I left out the oil and onion and just threw everything else into a rice cooker. It had a lot of flavor, but it was far too strong for us. Thanks for sharing!"
937635,71739,2010-10-18,5,Mmmmm Garlic! This is a Great rice side dish! I added salt (used water   chicken stock) and might use less thyme next time. Thanks for the keeper!
928301,71739,2011-12-15,4,"It was good, but I thought it needed more flavor--I can't afford Thyme prices--probably would have made all the difference.  I'll have to follow sweetp's suggestions next time; they look like some good ideas."
839492,71739,2012-06-11,5,Excellent and quick to prepare. I didn't have parsley or bay leaf...didn't miss them. The finished rice was flavorful and not overly garlicy. I really minced my onion and garlic fine. Cooking times were right on. Made with recipe #15580 & recipe #55173.
32772,73166,2003-10-29,5,"Wow!! All I can say about this recipe is it is FABULOUS!! Served it with 'Boston Market' cornbread, and side salad.  Made two patches of this and did both in the crockpot. Browned the meat with onions and garlic and then added it to the crockpot. I then added the other ingredients as listed. Cooked it on low for 8 hours. I made a patch for the family and another patch to take to my daughters field hockey game.  MMM...good."
9869,73166,2003-11-21,5,"This was delicious. I used a chili garlic sauce, 2 tins of kidney beans and 2 peppers and it was plenty warm enough for my family, my husbands comment on entering the back door was..'wow, thats going to be hot' lol, so I guess it smells good too.
I particularly liked the addition of cubed steak instead of just ground beef. "
89831,73166,2003-11-22,5,"Hi Amanda...made your chili last night for dinner. I served it with fresh homemade French bread and a dollup of sour cream on top in the bowl....WOW....what a great recipe for chili, followed the directions as posted, but left out the cubed sirloin, and made it with just ground beef, also I added one can of crushed tomatoes, cause I was worried that I would'nt have enough for my guests, it turned our amazingly delicious, we all had seconds, and my guests just raved about it, I had to hand over your recipe to my girlfriend, she was so impressed....Both myself and my DH are chili lovers, and I am always searching for good recipes for chili....well, this is certainly a real winner...thank you Amanda for your wonderful recipe:-) :-)"
58836,73166,2003-12-05,4,This was pretty good.  I didn't have some of the ing. but it was ok without them.  My dh thought it was a little sweet for chili.  Overall it was tasty.  Thanks
278113,73166,2006-02-08,5,"I made this with 1/4 cup brown sugar, and it is FANTASTIC!! Even better the next day! This is for sure my favorite chili so far! Thanks for sharing!"
280271,73166,2006-02-18,5,Awsomely Good!! All those different flavors dancing around in your month was wonderful. I took leftovers to work and had some of the girls taste it. No one could figure out what was in it. It was rated 5 stars there also.
37779,73166,2006-03-25,5,"My husband and I enjoyed this chili very much. It is quite different from our standard chili. The flavor had a delicate sweetness in addition to the spiced flavor. I would not call this a ""hot"" chili but it was very well seasoned. Two cans of beans was plenty for us. Thanks for posting this one--will certainly make it again. "
95743,73166,2006-04-09,0,"This definitely is a different chili.  Dh liked it well enough while I didn't care for it at all. I did substitite turkey for the ground beef but otherwise followed the recipe.  Guess that's why they make chocolate, vanilla and strawberry."
103876,73166,2006-11-06,5,"Great tasting chili!  I used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar since others had said it was rather sweet.  I also used only two cans of beans.  I didn't use the chili peppers, but am glad I didn't because I still thought it was a bit too spicy for my taste without them.  Next time I will cut back on the cayenne.  Overall, nice rich flavor and worth making again.  Thanks for posting!"
185285,73166,2006-12-24,2,"If you are looking for a sweet chili, this is a great choice.  This, however is not the recipe to select for the smoky chili fans in the house - I made the full serving for 4 of us, and although we all agreed it had a good taste, we prefer a the flavors of a fumy-type chili than what comes through here, and did not go for seconds."
269331,73166,2007-11-02,4,"Well if you like sweet chili, this is the recipe for youâ€¦ we are NOT sweet chili fans.  I thought this recipe sounded interesting with beer, coffee and cocoaâ€¦ but the brown sugar really spoiled it for us.  I had to add vinegar, extra chili powder and garlic to make it eatable to balance out the sweetness.  That being said, it was still a decent chili recipe, just cut back way back or eliminate the brown sugar.  PS. Did not add the beans and used ground turkey and substituted the chili peppers with chili powder."
229850,73166,2007-11-29,4,"This was good. Very different from the Wendy's chili I usually make. The coffee, beer and cocoa give it a distictively different taste."
389431,73166,2008-03-10,4,"This was good!
I didn't use the cubed beef, just substituted more ground beef and I didn't use all of the brown sugar (only about 1/4 C). After letting it cook, we decided that it needed a bit more bean (we like our beans around here!), so we added 2 cans of pintos to the pot.
It was tasty...
It wasn't the best chili I've ever had (that title belongs to my Papa... his chili is to die for!), but it was good and filling on a cold day!
Thanks so much!"
185926,73166,2008-03-15,5,Good combination of ingredients.  I used two cans of beans because my crockpot was full.  The taste has lots of depths and layers without being too spicy.  I used about 1 tablespoon of chili powder and two chopped jalapeno peppers.  My kids liked it and did not think it was too hot.  Thank you.
46660,73166,2008-09-18,4,"I am surprised I didn't like this better with all the rave reviews. I just found it to be almost sickeningly sweet. I didn't have time to read all the reviews or I probably would have seen that most people leave the chili sauce and brown sugar out and replace it with chili powder. I will be sure to make note and try it again that way, because the texture of it was perfect, so definitely worth working with until I find alterations that suit my tastes better."
39301,73166,2008-11-19,5,Great chili recipe!  Thanks for posting this winner - I've stuck with my same chili recipe for years.. I think this just replaced it!
499050,73166,2008-12-02,4,Very Good.
774665,73166,2009-01-31,5,I made this last year and forgot to review it. Now it's time for chili so I'm back for more. This is my keeper recipe for chili.
140132,73166,2009-02-22,4,"I made this for one of those cold nights....brrrr.  This is really a good chili, very complex flavor.  I will make this when we want to serve chili to guests, can't wait for them to try it.  Thank you for posting."
447123,73166,2009-02-27,5,"Ok got to admit at first I thought it sounded wierd. I couldnt imagine cocoa and beer and coffee in a recipe. But I just decided to go for it. I got a few odd looks from the hubby. But man oh man was it AMAZING!! Turned out a bit spicy but we love spicy stuff so it was PERFECT! Amanda Thaks so very much for posting this.
I usually use only one can of beans and it is amaing still!!!"
353131,73166,2009-03-03,5,"Made this for DD(11) birthday! Had made it last year and she requested it for her b-day. Cooked kidney beans(don't like to use canned),had to use some chili powder(couldn't find chili peppers),used all ground beef(couldn't find beef sirloin)and used a little less brown sugar than called for. Even with those few changes this was still awesome chili! Every member of our family loved it!!!"
74281,73166,2009-10-27,4,"I think as the recipe is written it is way to sweet. Instead I doubled the recipe but not the brown sugar or the beans. It was still pretty darned sweet. I got a bit confused reading some of the reviews because they talked about chili powder when the recipe calls for chili sauce so I used a bit of both. I also used 3 different kinds of beans, 1 can of red, 2 cans of kidney and 1 can of pinto. Overall it was really good chili that I would definitely make again only next time I would probably cut the brown sugar back to 1 tablespoon and add more to taste from there."
262312,73166,2009-11-14,5,"excellent chili!  i love the fact that this recipe calls for both steak chunks and ground beef!  i also really loved the addition of beer and coffee.  i omitted the sugar since we don't like sweet stuff.  i used black beans that i pressure cooked the day before, serrano peppers and poblanos, and i also added a few tablespoons of chili powder.  thanks for the winner chile recipe!!  oh and i used the crockpot!"
176615,73166,2009-12-08,4,"Good! Made this recipe on a very cold day with recipe #263660 and it really hit the spot. Very mild, not spicy, tomatoey, and definitely sweet. I'd seen this recipe on AllRecipes where it has nearly 900 reviews; that recipe calls for chili powder rather than chili sauce, so I assumed the chili sauce was a typo. Used 4 large jalapenos, good Penzey's chili powder, and some wonderful organic ground beef and sirloin steak. We enjoyed the dish, but it's very different from chili I grew up on which was much spicier. I've never added beans, but love what that does nutritionally and as it cooked down, the beans (I drained them)really thicken up the dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1122161,73166,2009-12-17,5,"This is definatly the best chili I ever tasted! I made this as directed only my store didn't have chili peppers, so I used 2 large jalapenoes. It was pretty spicy, which I loved. This chili was unbelievable! Thanks for posting!"
937635,73166,2010-01-18,5,"Fantastic chili! I've been trying to find a chili recipe I can use as a go-to and didn't have any luck until I found this one. This is a great chili with a wonderful semi-sweet and savory taste. I used 1.5lbs of ground beef and about a pound of beef stew meat and added an extra clove or garlic. I didn't have any chili peppers, so I subbed 2 teaspoons of chili powder as others suggested. I only used 1/2 tsp cayenne because I have a little one who loves beans, and the chili was perfectly spicy for us. I think 4 cans of kidney beans are perfect and give it that healthy boost of fiber (not to mention, my 15 month old Loves them!). Thanks!"
400708,73166,2010-02-02,4,"I been saving this recipe for some time waiting to try and yesterday was just the cold, dreary day to give it a try.  The only differance I made was to use chili powder instead of sauce as that's what we had on hand and really enjoyed this.  The taste was differant from what we usually expect from chile but very nice.  DH felt it was a little too sweet (I liked it) so would probably leave out the brown sugar next time.  By the way, the directions didn't mention when to add the sugar - so I just added it with the spices.  We served with recipe#410289 but think next time I'd use a simple corn bread recipe.  We did enjoy this, specially with the beef added to the regular ground beef."
231054,73166,2010-05-12,5,"It's a long story -- and I'll spare all of you the details -- only to say that I had started another recipe that I realized wasn't going to work, but it had ALL the starter ingredients this recipe did -- so I switched to this.  And what a winner!!!!  So nice to be able to salvage 2 lbs. of meat and other ingredients and come up with something that is so wonderful.  I don't need to say any more -- others have covered all of that.  I thank you for sharing your recipe."
1506604,73166,2010-08-06,0,"Really nice. I cooked it for longer because I think it added to the richness. I looked online for a dark beer substitute and discovered apple cider vinegar. I put in way too much vinegar but it came out nicely. So I advise if you are looking for a substitute, go ahead and use it but use less than the prescribed dark beer requirement. Very easy, you pretty much just throw it in and stir once in awhile.. I would leave it for more than thirty minutes and it still never burned, love that kind of recipe!"
199020,73166,2010-10-06,5,"My husband fixed this for us. It was the best chili I've ever had! We chose this recipe because it was different from the usual. The beer, coffee, and cocoa gave it a unique flavor. I loved the addition of sirloin and would add more next time. We used the full amount of brown sugar and didn't think it was too sweet at all. It helps balance the acidity of the tomatoes. The only thing I may add next time is some chopped jalapenos to kick up the heat. We loved the recipe and will definitely be making it again soon!"
1133190,73166,2010-11-06,5,We had this last night and were pleasantly surprised!  After reading a few negative reviews I wasn't sure what to expect but we loved it!  I did half the sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  I added a few fresh tomatoes in addition to the can and my husband and I agreed that if i omitted the steak next time it would be just as good.  Thanks for a fun new chili recipe!
15521,73166,2011-01-06,5,"My husband thought that calling this the Best Chili You Will Ever Taste was a little presumptuous.  But after eating it I think he might agree. At least One of the Best Chilis You Will Ever Taste.  I omitted the brown sugar, as so many reviewers seemed to be cutting it back so much.  Next time I might try adding a little bit, but we thought it was delicious without it as well!"
2041603,73166,2011-10-26,5,"I hated this but my husband thought it was amazing. I typically reduce the amount of onions I add as I'm not quite accustomed to them yet, but I didn't do that with this recipe and I think that's why I hated it. My husband, however, agrees that it is the best chili you will ever taste! Someday I'll try again with fewer onions."
810787,73166,2012-10-30,2,I wish I had read the reviews! This is too sweet for my taste. Now I have a gigantic pot of chili and have no clue what to do with it.
226863,73166,2013-01-02,4,"This is so sweet!  Tooth-achingly sweet! I made according to the recipe, although I only used 2 cans of beans...the poster actually said she cut the bean amount, so I felt that was okay on my first try on this recipe.  Maybe the extra beans take away from the sweetness, but I have always enjoyed a ""meat"" chili, not a ""bean"" chili, so tried for that. I enjoyed the mix of cubed sirloin and ground meat.....that is what I usually use.  I also do not use chili powder, basically making my own.  However, this chili is extremely sweet.  I can't say it is awful, but my mouth recoiled when I took a bite....it was expecting ""chili"", not candied baked beans.  This recipe is edible....but it doesn't taste like chili to me.  I'm giving this a 3 star, because it doesn't taste horrible, just not what you expect from chili.  I'm sad, because this is the first ""new"" chili recipe I've tried in years.....going back to my own tried and true recipe.***Letting this chili sit overnight lets the heat increase and temper the sweetness.  So I'm changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars."
50969,99476,2005-04-15,4,"this was very good,and i will be making it again. it took me a little longer to cook than was stated,but it was well worth the wait.thank you for posting."
187281,99476,2005-08-29,4,"This is a good, easy stir-fry dish.  I also appreceiated the lack of expensive or hard-to-find ingredients.  It is very kid friendly and great for those with a limited amount of time for dinner prep.  I wouldn't recommend it for those who are use to a very ""authentic"" style of stir-fry dishes as the flavor tasted like it had been adapted to American taste buds."
173314,99476,2006-01-09,5,"Very good recipe!  Made with fried rice and since I doubled, I froze half for future dinner which I will look forward to!"
278113,99476,2006-02-11,5,"I thought this was just fabulous, and so did my family! I used London Broil, and precut broccoli florets.  Thanks for sharing, we will be making this often!! "
137911,99476,2006-03-23,5,"This was very easy and delicious.  Just the right amount of sauce.  I liked the little sweetness of the sauce too, I haven't added (brown)sugar before in Beef & Broccoli. My only change from the recipe was using light sodium soy sauce.  I served it over jasmine rice."
136997,99476,2006-10-27,4,"Very easy to throw together. I think the next time though, I'll use fresh garlic as I found that it needed just a wee bit of something. :)"
158086,99476,2007-01-15,5,"Great, great recipe...made this along with bourbon chicken for our family get together dinner and got rave reviews....easy and fast.
thanks"
140132,99476,2007-01-30,5,I have been on a chinese food kick and this is one my son requested.  It was very easy to put together and very good.  We enjoyed this. I served this with fried rice.  Thank you for a keeper.....Stephanie
373817,99476,2007-02-26,5,"Very good recipe! I added sliced carrots, green peppers and more onions. Also, instead of the brown sugar, I added about a teaspoon of mirin. I'll definitely make this again! Thanks!"
111291,99476,2007-08-30,5,"Made this for DH...or so I thought!  I'm not much of a red meat eater, but I had to taste test this, and I must say, it is delicious!  Made just as posted, but used fresh garlic (1 clove), cut back on the oil (1 tsp.) and added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper for some added heat (personal preference).  YUMMY."
331557,99476,2007-11-21,4,"This was a quick and easy weekday meal, especially when you cut things up beforehand.  I did use fresh garlic and ginger instead of the powder and added them with the broccoli and onions.  The onions soaked up the garlic and ginger and were quite tasty.  I also doubled the sauce because we love sauce.  Thanks for posting!"
142335,99476,2007-12-10,5,Thanks Chris! I made this for lunch yesterday and it was fantastic! I'm eating the leftovers right now ;)
248023,99476,2008-01-24,4,True to it's name... very easy stir fry to put together...  really does uses ingredients most people will have in their pantry.  I used only half an onion and mushroom soy sauce...  My BF gave this 5 stars and I gave it 3...hence the 4 star rating.  I thought it was really sweet and maybe needed a little red pepper flake to spice it up a bit.  He raved about how tender the meat was and how good the sauce tasted.  Loved the fact that there was no marinating time!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!
353131,99476,2008-02-06,5,Made for dinner yesterday. DD(7) loved it!! She requested this everyday. DD(9) also really enjoyed. DS(8) was not as wild about it but did eat it. DH said it was good and a keeper! I ate til I was miserable!
222433,99476,2008-05-04,5,Very easy and tasty! The beef came out tender. I had to leave out the onion so my daughter would eat it. Thanks Chris!
8629,99476,2008-06-01,4,I was very happy with how this recipe turned out.  I made it as directed except I left out the ginger because of personal preference.  I used a light soy sauce.  This is a very good tasting recipe.
250031,99476,2008-07-15,5,"We enjoyed this immensely. My daughter requested it and gave it five stars. This definitely goes on our ""make again"" (and again) list! Edited to say I added a little dab of red chili paste to this and it gave it a touch more flavor but no heat. A family favorite!"
386849,99476,2008-08-21,5,Wonderful recipe.  Really easy and fast.  I used sesame oil for the vegetable oil and that helped with the Chinese taste. Thanks for posting!
400420,99476,2008-10-29,4,"This was really good!  I used leftover tri tip and cooked it just as directed.  I used fresh garlic and doubled the sauce - except for the ginger, but wish I would have doubled that, too, as I could barely taste it.  I used about 1 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch in the sauce, but I think 1 tbsp would have been plenty.  I also added a few mushrooms to the mix.  I will be making this again!  Thank you!"
74281,99476,2008-12-15,5,So delicious and very easy to make. I used Round Steak and doubled the recipe but it only made 6 servings for my extremely hungry family. My husband said it was way better than his favorite Beef and Broccoli from the Chinese restaurant. The 147 people who reviewed this before me were absolutely right to give this recipe such great ratings!
489552,99476,2009-01-12,5,"Wow I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe.  I have made this twice and my family loves it.  It is so easy to make and taste like Chinese takeout :)
Thank you for a great recipe!"
189475,99476,2009-02-07,5,"This was so easy and it tasted great. The only thing that I would do differently next time is that I would cook the broccoli for 3-4 minutes before adding the onions and cooking them both for another 4-5 minutes. I thought the broccoli was too hard, but other than that this meal was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!"
229850,99476,2009-04-08,5,"Sorry I must have forgot to review this, I make this often. It is easy, and very delicious. We really enjoy this, and this version is awesome! I usually double this recipe for the family, but I do not completely double the ginger, I usually do 1 1/2 teaspoon of the ginger, other than that as written is great !!"
226863,99476,2009-04-23,5,"So easy and sooo good!  Even my picky DS that will only eat broccoli covered in cheese loved this.  This goes in my ""keeper"" cookbook!  Thanks for sharing the great recipe.  Made for All New Zaar Cookbook Tag!"
140806,99476,2009-07-18,4,I know this is sacrilege but I made tofu and broccoli! It would have been 5 stars for me but the sauce was too salty for my taste. I think adding a touch more brown sugar would balance it out a little better. The sauce thickened beautifully and this recipe really did work well with tofu (in case any of you are feeling brave!)
579298,99476,2009-08-10,5,"This was fantastic!!! Followed directions to a T and it turned out great! Next time I will use reduced sodium soy sauce, otherwise perfect :)"
231054,99476,2009-08-18,5,"I subbed chicken for the beef as well as zucchini for the broccoli. It was awesome! I did take the advice of another reviewer and marinated the chicken strips for an hour or so. I used a mixture of soy sauce, sherry, ginger and garlic. I then drained that off and picked up with the the step of mixing in the cornstarach mixture. Along with the onion I also added some sliced mushrooms. This is a very forgiving recipe and you can do lots of variations with it. I want to try some prawns the next time. We really enjoyed this and look forward to having it many times in the future. Thanks for sharing the recipe with so many of us, Chris."
59163,99476,2009-08-19,5,"This was delish, quick and easy to make. Didn't change a thing, but might add some other veggies next time.  Was very good the next day for lunch too!"
44383,99476,2009-10-03,5,This is a really good stir fry recipe and I've added it to my regular rotation cookbook.  Didn't change anything except used sirloin tip instead of round steak so beef was extremely tender.  Thanks for posting this as DH loves stir fry's so any new one is a treat for me.
222970,99476,2009-11-11,5,Good recipe. It tastes more or less like something you'd get at a restaurant. I added red bell pepper like someone suggested.
1506604,99476,2010-02-22,4,It tasted really good and it was similar to the restaurant taste but not exactly it. Still good though but still in search to replicate the Chinese restaurant taste...
126440,99476,2010-02-23,5,"Loved this easy recipe.  I added sesame oil, ginger and sriracha to the marinate for flank steak and red pepper, mushrooms to the veggies.
Served with Recipe #72124 and rice."
316717,99476,2010-02-24,5,this has to be the easiest beef and broccoli recipe i came acroos. i did sub the meat w/ chicken instead but followed everything else to the T. was a big hit w/ the whole fam and there's none left over except onions. ha. next time tho i will use low sodium soy and a bit more brown sugar since i like my beef & broccoli a tad sweeter. great recipe tho thanks for sharing!
389431,99476,2010-04-02,5,"Excellent!!  I doubled the sauce, added fresh ginger, extra garlic, spinach, carrots and scallions...  yummmmmmmm....
Thanks so very much!"
1133190,99476,2010-05-26,4,Very good recipe.  I agree with others that the sauce could be doubled and will try this next time.
294000,99476,2011-05-10,5,"We love this!! So easy and quick. It's my husband's favorite and I love being able to make it fresh for him. I usually double the sauce and use a lower sodium soy sauce. (Of course, then I've been known to add a little extra garlic salt so not sure how much good that does for us, lol.). This is definitely going to be a regular in our house."
456858,99476,2011-08-16,3,"Well, after making this dish, I wondered why I even bothered.  Wait, don't get me wrong...I NEVER order or eat beef and broccoli stir fry at Chinese restaurants.  I think I always stayed clear of the beef and broccoli for fear of not knowing exactly what cut of beef I was eating.  Then I made this recipe and I don't think I am a fan of beef and broccoli stir fry.  I used chuck steak in this stir fry and it was pretty good, and it definitely wasn't tough.  So, thanks to Chris from Kansas for this recipe....I got to try a new cut of beef (chuck steak).  Normally I only eat rib eye, but now that I have experienced chuck steak, this will def help keep costs down when preparing other recipes that call for beef.  I won't make again, just because I am not a beef and broccoli kind of girl.. But, by all means, if you like beef and broccoli stir fry...I suggest giving this recipe a try."
333017,99476,2011-10-28,4,"This is a nice, easy recipe.  Next time though, I think I would use fresh garlic and ginger.  I found the power stuff got lost in transist.  I used half a package of mixed veggies, which was very convient.  I also added 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  Omit the salt, you don't need it...and I used low sodium soy sauce!!  I really don't think you need to double the recipe to get more sauce...I just added more water and the sauce cooked up to the consistency I needed. (but then, I don't like my food swimming in sauces!)  Served over a mix of wild and brown rice....I would do this one again!!"
2041603,99476,2011-11-13,5,"This is the first stir fry I've ever made and the first I've ever tried. It was amazing. I used 20oz of frozen broccoli florets, less onion and eye of round steak. We served over rice. It was soooo good! I can't wait to have it tomorrow for lunch!"
969481,99476,2013-07-27,5,"Great recipe. The only change I made was choice of steak. We used ribeye because they looked really fresh at the meat counter! Other than that, made as posted and just as good as any restaurant. Thanks for sharing!"
55729,99476,2011-12-07,0,"I enjoyed this (as leftovers after derby scrimmage) when my daughter finished cooking it for me. I had finished step 2 when I had to leave. All of us agreed that the sauce was a little too thick. I realize, however, that she might not have understood exactly how much cornstarch and water she still needed to add. I think I would make this again as written before trying to change it. The balance of flavors was good."
350750,99476,2012-08-27,5,"Sure was tasty and quick, thank you!"
1365025,99476,2012-09-12,5,Very tasty. Easy to make. I would make this again for sure.
1179225,99476,2012-10-31,5,"MmmmMmmm....This hit the spot! This is a very different recipe than what I usually use for beef stir fry. I usually add sherry and sesame oil,leaving out the brown sugar. This was a nice mild sauce that glazed the meat to perfection. Chuck steak was just the right cut of meat, it was soooo tender. This meal was simple to put together and delicious. I'll be making this again. Thanks for posting the recipe."
632249,99476,2013-12-20,4,"We liked this recipe and I made it exactly as written. The next time, I would use real garlic instead of powdered. I added more water as the sauce was too thick but all in all we enjoyed this. Thank your for the recipe."
265954,99476,2015-10-31,5,"Very good. I definitely will use the low sodium soy sauce next time. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and made the sauce first, added a pinch of red pepper flakes, and marinated the steak pieces in the sauce for an hour. I then made as directed for the rest of the recipe, adding only an additional 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic at the end, as the rest of the ingredients simmered. I can&#039;t wait to make this again with the low sodium soy sauce. I think we&#039;ll enjoy this dish even more."
176615,99476,2016-03-07,5,Good and super easy. I doubled the sauce and added a few shakes of crushed red pepper. Thanks for the recipe!
175824,99476,2016-08-05,5,WOW was this great. I followed the recipe exactly. I did double the sauce. I used day old cold long grain rice and made a quick version of fried rice. I stirred fried the rice in peanut oil adding a few tablespoons of soy sauce and a few drops of sesame oil. Everyone said 10 stars. Next time I think I will add mushrooms. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.
1581225,99476,2016-11-07,5,This was simple and flavourful. My husband loved it!
110506,69173,2004-09-11,5,I made these meatballs for a family reunion along with homeade spaghetti sauce. These have to be the very best meatballs I have ever made. Everyone raved about how good they were. They were so tender and melt in your mouth good. I used beef and pork since veal was not available to me. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for such an outstanding recipe!!!!!
52543,69173,2005-05-10,5,Oh yeah - these are good!! There was no veal in the butcher shop so I used 1 lb beef & 1/2 lb pork. I browned in my saute pan & cooked at 350F for 20 minutes before adding to the last of the Spicy Tomato Sauce that I canned last summer. I served over whole wheat spaghetti with Caesar Salad & Garlic toast for a yummy dainner. Thanx Kitten!
149363,69173,2005-05-19,5,"These were absolutely hands down the best meatballs I have ever made!
I used them for Kitten's recipe for Meatball Sub Casserole #70205 and they were so delicious!
They were just bursting with flavour, and DH and I were eating them before we could get them in the casserole.
This will be how I prepare meatballs from now on!
I baked them in the oven, as I wasn't preparing sauce, but next time I make spaghetti....look out!
Thanks for another keeper Kitten!"
92886,69173,2005-10-03,4,I used beef and pork and baked them in the oven.  They had lots of flavor and a nice texture.  I would enjoy using this again.
173579,69173,2006-04-09,5,"Kittencal, These meatballs were just wonderful!  I had my family over and had italian dishes.  This was one of them.  My family said they had never had any meatballs so good.  Will be having them again soon, I""m sure.  Thanks for posting.  "
280166,69173,2006-07-05,5,Great recipe and easy to double...eerrr triple.  We ate two batches and only one made it to the freezer. Thanks for posting!
39301,69173,2006-10-09,5,Fantastic meatballs.  I used romano cheese and dropped them in simmering sauce for a yummy birthday meal for my son!  Thanks for sharing.
251917,69173,2006-10-23,5,Delicious! I prefered them fried though but that is just my taste preference for meatballs! Thank you for an awesome recipe!
49304,69173,2006-10-29,5,"These are delicious, moist meatballs. Made them using beef & veal. I fried some to add to pasta and froze the rest to use later. I will drop them right into the sauce next time I make pasta sauce. Thank you, Kitten!"
138429,69173,2006-11-05,5,Delicious Kittencal! I used 11/2 lbs beef and 1/2 lb pork. I made these up into hamburger patties to cook on the  BBQ. They were perfect in a hamburger bun. Great flavor. I made up some meatballs that I froze to use at a later date as well.Will be keeping this recipe close at hand. Thanks Kittencal for this excellent recipe.
103876,69173,2007-01-18,5,Excellent meatballs!  Just the right texture and flavor.  Thanks for posting.
394077,69173,2007-01-28,4,I used turkey meat and the meatballs were delish.  Thank you for posting your recipe.
333017,69173,2007-02-15,5,"These were perfect...wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks, Kittencal!"
158086,69173,2007-03-04,5,I have to say these were the star dish of my Sunday dinner...I served about 22 people and everyone kept raving about the meatballs...
60989,69173,2007-03-06,5,"I have been making this for years and can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. This was recommended to me 3 years ago by the original chef: KMT, who got the recipe from her father. Yummy... very tasty. Made with Authentic Italian Tomato  sauce #92096, and it was perfect. Thanks!"
251626,69173,2007-03-07,5,"Absolutely the BEST. I used these for spaghetti snd meatblls, meatball sub sandwiches or with Kittencal's easy sweet and sour meatballs #132439. They are so good and the first ones that my meatball phobic son will eat. Thanks."
207176,69173,2007-03-07,4,"I think that I used too much Lawry's seasoned salt (1 1/2 tsp.) for our taste because my oldest son loved them at first and then said, after a few, that they were too salty and we agreed.  I will make them with 1/2 tsp. next time.  Thanks for posting."
137911,69173,2007-05-03,5,"Wow, these were as good as my sister-in-laws meatballs!  I don't have her 'secret' recipe but now I have yours Kittencal!  She cooks hers the same way, in the sauce.  These turned out so moist, tender and delicious!  Full of flavor.  A 4-sure  repeat for our family! Pam"
136997,69173,2007-05-05,4,"Delicious! My husband was so happy when I made spaghetti and these meatballs, as I don't make that kind of meal very often. I used ground chicken and I increased the seasonings a bit. Nice texture and I simmered them in the sauce being careful not to over stir them. :)"
229524,69173,2007-05-06,5,So good and easy to make.  Won't be buying frozen meatballs ever again.  Thanks Kittencal :)
173314,69173,2007-05-20,5,Just made this in oven and will put in sauce to simmer.They are delicious.....thankyou
231054,69173,2007-07-03,5,"It appears I've once again overlooked posting a review!  I've made these numerous times.  This is a very, very similar recipe to the one my Dad always used.  He would soak about 4 pieces of older bread in water water first, squeeze out the moisture and then proceed -- other than that, the recipe is identical to his.  I decided to try using the bread crumbs and we think they are wonderful.  I've baked them in the oven for about 5 minutes -- but lately, just drop then directly into the sauce. Either way produces wonderfully flavored meatballs.  Thanks, Kitten."
142367,69173,2007-07-09,5,"Be sure you make enough of these or be prepared for a fight.  I thought my family was going to duke it out for the last meatball -- they are just that good.  Even my husband who is burned out on meatballs from his childhood, raved about these.  I made these in Kittencal's sauce and even though they simmered for hours, they held together.  What a great and easy recipe.  Thanks yet again Kittencal."
125640,69173,2007-07-11,5,"These are easy and absolutely delicious. I used 1/2 lb ground pork and 1 lb beef, 1/2 tsp oregano, and the full 2 tsp seasoning salt. I baked the meatballs for 25 minutes. So flavorful that they didn't even need sauce. Thanks for sharing. We'll definitely have them again."
520150,69173,2007-07-15,5,"I don't usually make meatballs.  My dh likes spagetti with ground beef.  Everytime I try them, he says they are ""OK"".  So why do all that extra work?  Well, now I found a wonderful recipe!  Not only can we have meatballs in our spagetti, but can also have meatball sandwiches! (That's the only thing he orders from Subway)  Thank you very much for this wonderful recipe."
18391,69173,2007-07-16,5,"Magnificent recipe! Well received by all my guests! My brother said it was better than restaurant meatballs and sauce. I made this with your Pasta sauce recipe, Thanks for sharing such great recipes!"
131021,69173,2007-08-19,5,These were so good. I made them to freeze and probably ate a half dozen before I could get them all in the freezer. I made mine out of ground chuck and I love that you can actually taste the parmesan cheese. I tripled the recipe and used cracker crumbs for 2/3 of the bread crumbs.
400420,69173,2007-09-09,5,"Just like everyone else, we loved these!  I used 1 lb of ground beef and subbed 1/2 the breadcrumbs with wheat germ.  I put them it the oven just as I was leaving to pick up DD.  When we got home, you could smell them before we got into the house!  DD said ""yum! what are you making?? I have to have some of that!"". We ate them straight from the oven - no sauce or anything! Awesome!  Thank you!"
312577,69173,2007-10-12,5,"I have learned to trust your recipes.  I was nervous about putting the uncooked meatballs in the sauce, but it REALLY WORKS!  The meatballs stayed perfectly shaped and came out tender and flavorful.  I loved this recipe. As usual Kittencal's recipes are the best!"
53932,69173,2007-11-17,5,I used ground turkey and the meatballs were excellent!  I  baked them in a 350 oven for about 25 minutes and served with a mushroom sauce over egg noodles.
482376,69173,2007-11-19,5,"Fantastic! I made these meatballs to go with Kittencal's Spaghetti and Meatball Casserole, which is awesome.  The meatballs came out tender and had great flavor.I wasn't sure if I should have used plain bread crumbs, but I only had Italian style and it worked well.
Thanks for a wonderful meatball recipe! :-)"
184723,69173,2007-11-19,5,"I made these instead of plain ground hamburger in my noodle soup and WOW! The soup turned out great!!! Like a lot of reviewers, I baked mine beforehand in the oven at 350 for 20 mins - and I am glad I lined my cookie sheets with foil!!! Will use this recipe again and again I'm sure... in fact, next time I'll double it and freeze half. Thanks!"
579298,69173,2007-11-30,5,I went with the ground white turkey... these were the best meatballs I have ever had! It was amazing to experience the differece adding milk made. And the cooking technique (in the sauce) deserves its OWN 5 star rating! You need to try this one!
135887,69173,2007-12-01,5,Excellent when cooked in the sauce.  I used half pork and half ground beef.  We all love these and I have made them several times.  Thanks Kit!
229850,69173,2007-12-16,5,"Wow ! These were delish ! I hardly ever make meatballs because I have never been a fan. And I certainly never add them to my pasta sauce. Just didnt really like any of them that I have had. Boy what a difference these make. They were soooo tender and moist, and the flavor was out of this world good !Made exactly as stated except I did use half and half in place of milk. Thanx again Kittencal you have converted me to a meatball lover !"
265954,69173,2007-12-23,5,"Very good meatball recipe.  I tweaked a bit:  used 2 lbs. of beef (I grind it myself), used 2 eggs, 3/4 cup bread crumbs, 2 tsps. regular table salt, 1/2 cup 2 percent milk, 1 tsp. oregano, and left the rest as is.  I boiled the meatballs in a simmering pasta sauce for 2 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally and being careful not to undo the meatballs.  So tender.  I served the meatballs and sauce over ziti.  Thanks for posting, Kittencal!"
377581,69173,2007-12-28,5,"Absolutely excellent! Delicious and quite easy to prepare. I followed the recipe to the letter, using 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic and 1 teaspoon oregano. I served this with steamed broccoli and my family and I really enjoyed it. I will be making this again for sure! Thank you for posting!"
774665,69173,2008-03-10,5,These are by far the best meatballs  I've had the pleasure to make. They were a hit with the whole family. I used a combo of beef and pork and actually read the recipe wrong and added a cup of parmesan cheese because I doubled the recipe.   They were fantastic. I cooked half of them in the sauce and half of them in the oven.
146486,69173,2008-03-10,5,These are sooooo good and they totally melt in your mouth just like it says.  I used all beef and seasoned bread crumbs and we absolutely loved them!  Thanks Kittencal for a delicious recipe!
262312,69173,2008-04-10,5,"oh wow...this recipe is insane!!  dh, who doesn't like meatballs was in awe of how tasty these were.  i probably used 1/2 c parm...next time i might even use more!  instead of milk, i used heavy cream...i think next time i'll use 1/2 c, instead of 1/3.  i formed the meatballs and let rest in the fridge for 24 hrs.  i made mini bite-sized meatballs that i baked at 350 for about 10 minutes, then i dropped them into my homemade sauce.  i can't thank you enough for this delish recipe.  i will only make meatballs this way from now on!  thanks for making my dh a meatball lover!  ;)  your recipes are always the best, carol!"
60992,69173,2008-04-23,5,Great meatballs! The milk is the secret to the tenderness! I used 1 pound ground chuck and 1/2 pound hot italian sausage. Cooking the meatballs directly in the sauce adds a lovely flavor to the sauce and keeps the meatballs very moist. Another kittencal winner!
176615,69173,2008-06-06,5,"Wonderful! I've been meaning to make these meatballs for some time, but tonight used the recipe for burgers. Really delicious from the grill, and would be equally wonderful with spaghetti sauce. Used homemade whole wheat breadcrumbs, 1/2 c parmesan, 2 T fresh garlic, and seasoned salt as suggested by Kitten. Will make again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
426903,69173,2008-06-24,5,"Great meatball recipe, thanks for posting!!"
37449,69173,2008-09-11,5,I made this using ground chuck. I simmered in spaghetti sauce. My husband really enjoyed with whole wheat angel hair pasta. Thanks Kit!
248023,69173,2008-09-20,5,"I had no idea what to make for dinner and as I was reading through reviews came across this recipe...  I had all the ingredients on hand so it must have been fate!  I took your recommendation of the 1lb of beef and 1/2lb of pork... and used 1/3c of parmesan, garlic powder, only 1 tsp salt, 1/3c organic 2% milk, a dash of oregano and 2Tbs of dried parsley...   I chose the dried/powdered ingredients to make this recipe super fast and easy to clean (one bowl, cup and spoon!)  I chose to bake mine first since I was defrosting the sauce in my crock pot and I wanted to make sure these would cook through in time for dinner since I started it late...  These were the most tender meatballs I have ever had!!!  Just delicious and perfectly seasoned...  I might try some fresh basil in them next time instead of oregano...  I let them sit in my sauce in my crock pot for close to 4 hours...  We can't wait to try them in meatball subs soon...  Thanks for posting!!!"
222433,69173,2008-09-23,5,These ARE good! I used hamburger. The 40 minutes of cooking in the sauce was perfect. I had some leftover so I threw them in the freezer for later.
847160,69173,2008-10-06,4,good meatballs
497077,69173,2008-10-18,5,"DELICIOUS!!! I made exactly as written using fresh garlic, seasoned salt, oregano, and fresh parsley. I only needed about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. I made these last night, simmered in sauce for 2 hours, then for dinner tonight I simmered an additional 1 hour-added great flavor to my sauce, too! (Also, I made a tiny patty to taste-test and I highly recommend this recipe for burgers.) Thank you again, Kitten, for a great recipe!!!"
499050,69173,2008-11-15,4,Very Good!
140806,69173,2008-12-03,5,"DH loved these! He was a bit ambitious and made them three times the size they are meant to be, so it took a little while longer to bake (45 minutes.) We used 1/2 beef 1/2 pork. I recommend mixing the dry ingredients in a separate bowl so they distribute evenly when added to the meat. Served on a bed of linguine topped with homemade marinara."
58836,69173,2008-12-09,4,I have been wanting to make these for some time now and finally did last week.  I think I still have some in my frezzer.  They were pretty good.  I used them to make a meatball sandwich.  DH wasn't crazy about them but I liked them ok.  Thanks
242484,69173,2008-12-27,5,Fabulous meatballs!  Made for Xmas dinner with our Italian meal and they were absolutely divine! I browned mine up a little before putting in the sauce.
142335,69173,2009-01-30,5,"I have to change my rating from 4 to 5 stars. I've figured out how make this recipe work for me. I had some in the freezer and the taste was unbelievable when I cooked them. Now, I make these a day ahead and let the flavors meld. The next day I cook them and I think the flavors really pop! I used this recipe again this week and prepared them a day ahead with ground turkey. Next day added to spaghetti sauce to cook and they were delicious!!"
226863,69173,2009-02-01,5,"Today I made these instead of the meatballs listed in your Recipe #218911.  Very similar, but I added 1/2 lb pork to the other recipe.  I like both meatball recipes!  These are always requested by my DS for anything special...today the superbowl. Thanks for posting such great recipes!"
318235,69173,2009-02-12,5,I can't believe I forgot to rate these! They were delicious. First attempt at meatballs and they were so good. Everyone at my table went back for more. Thanks Kitten.
40961,69173,2009-02-17,5,I love these meatballs. They are so good either on rolls for meatball subs or over spaghetti. thanks for sharing your delicious recipe:)
36944,69173,2009-02-24,5,"This is a wonderful recipe that gives you wonderful directions and results in delicious meatballs.  If you have any questions the Chef, Kittencal, is very helpful and informative.  I made a double batch of these for a party.  The only change I made was rather than using regular breadcrumbs I put garlic croutons through my food processor to use in the meatballs.  I baked these in the oven, then froze them several days prior to party day.  I also made and froze recipe #153093 which is what I served with them.  The morning of the party I took out the meat balls and the sauce and let them thaw until ready to use.  While the meatballs were heating in the oven I heated the marinara sauce in the microwave.  When all was hot I stirred them together and served them in a chafing dish to keep warm.  They were a big hit with everyone!  Thanks for sharing your time so generously with me and also your delicious recipe!"
47559,69173,2009-03-05,5,"I'll add my high five to the list.  The meatballs were delicious, and really improved the flavor of bottled tomato basil sauce.  The family raved about the meal."
461834,69173,2009-03-12,5,"Wonderful meatballs!!!  I made these using all ground beef.  These are very similar to the way I make meatballs but I always add chopped/minced onion, so I did opt to add them to yours.  I also used crushed saltines for the bread crumbs but otherwise followed as written.  I chose to bake them in the oven for about 35-40 minutes, as I made jumbo size meatballs.  My family, as well as my 16 yo DS's friend enjoyed these meatballs.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Stars Tag."
126440,69173,2009-03-15,5,I made this using beef and pork and we loved the recipe.  Made it to go with my Recipe #360048. I partially cooked the meat balls in the oven and then into the sauce to finish. Served it with parmesan bread and was a delicious meal.
768828,69173,2009-04-06,5,Another awesome recipe kittencal.  Thanks so much. I also baked them.  I added some to spaghetti sauce and spooned them over baguettes for a meatball sandwich.  Yummy.  Thanks again for such a great recipe.
64642,69173,2009-07-14,5,"These were delicious and got a thumbs up from an extra-picky little girl!  I've always browned meatballs in the past, but these worked just fine without that step.  The absolute key is to leave them undisturbed to simmer in the sauce.  This recipe made 42 walnut-sized meatballs for me."
140132,69173,2009-08-02,5,"Another excellent recipe from you Kittencal!  I made these last night and they cooked up beautifully.  Very flavorful meatballs and kept their shape in the sauce.  Thank you so much for a good meatball recipe.  We love meatballs but I was haviing trouble finding ""the one"" recipe.  Thank you for sharing this with us."
1179225,69173,2009-08-15,5,Yummmmmy! We loved these and plan on making plenty more to keep in the freezer. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
252816,69173,2009-09-03,5,"Had a sale on hamberger and decided to make a  double batch of meatballs to freeze..I started making my usual recipe and remembered I wanted to make this recipe..So,I have a couple of changes..I used 2 large onions,chopped fine,3/4 cup milk and 1 cup breadcrumbs,4 small eggs,also used 3 tsp garlic powder..Then followed this recipe...We dont care for greasy sauce or soft meatballs so I baked them....Baked them in the oven at 4oo for 25-35 minutes..Cool completely and flash freeze and put them in a large ziplock for future meals..We loved the flavor and texture...Will make these often..These were better then my usual recipe....Thank U..."
168462,69173,2009-12-31,5,"These were really easy and quite easy to make. I served them with a dipping sauce, ""Recipe #186729"". Your recipes are becoming famous in my house. Thanks for the recipe."
937635,69173,2010-02-01,5,"Perfect meatballs, Kitten! Your recipes are no-fail! I used 2tsp of seasoning salt - I was a little nervous that it would be too much, but I should have trusted Kitten's wisdom. I simmered it in a pot of Trader Joe's Puttanesca sauce. Perfecto! This is now my go-to meatball recipe."
218535,69173,2010-10-11,5,Best meatballs ever!
1133190,69173,2010-10-17,5,"Really, really good!  I baked the meatballs in the oven to save time. I used all ground beef and italian flavored bread crumbs.  Thanks for another amazing and easy recipe!"
540346,69173,2010-10-30,4,The ingredients in these meatballs are wonderful and I was looking forward to having them.  I made them with Kittencal's pasta sauce and it suggests cooking the meatballs in the simmering sauce for 3-5 hours.  I did that and I don't think I fully got to experience the flavor of the meatball.  Next time I will bake them first or brown them in the skillet before I put them in the sauce.  Note: I doubled the recipe and got 100 meatballs.
264017,69173,2011-01-18,5,"Proud to be the 740th reviewer for this super recipe, I can only echo all of the previous wonderful comments. Besides the flavor, the ease in making these tender morsels was the best part. I used one pound of lean ground beef and one pound of lean ground pork. I didn't have dry bread crumbs, so used crushed crackers instead. This is definitely company worthy. Thanks Kitten!"
8629,69173,2011-04-04,5,"My husband said these were the best meatballs he has ever eaten. Wow, that is incredibly high praise. I made a half recipe. I got 19 meatballs that were 1.7 oz. each.   Not only did they taste good, but they were very tender.  I froze the unbaked meatballs for a week, defrosted them and cooked them in sauce and then froze them again for a month before we ate them.  After all that, they still tasted delicious."
185446,69173,2011-04-04,4,"Add me to the growing list who enjoyed this recipe.  While tasty, I can't really describe the meatballs as melt-in-your-mouth.  They were easy to make and tasted like....meatballs.  Nothing extraordinary.  Since there are only two of us here, I used leftover raw meatball mixture as hamburgers the next day, as Kittencal recommended.  If you like hamburgers that taste like meatballs, go for it.  We prefer traditional hamburger flavor, and won't do that again."
13796,69173,2011-04-19,0,"Very good meatballs. I halved the salt and in place of milk I had heavy cream to use up. Worked great. I baked the meatballs for 25 minutes and then cooled and froze them individually on a cookie sheet and then put them into Zip style bags in the freezer. Love the fresh parsley. Next time I think I'll use a little fresh basil, too."
456858,69173,2011-09-07,3,":-(  Oh, Kittencalskitchen, I was really hoping I would like this recipe.  I already have a meatball recipe (from this site) and I really like it.  But, you know I am a fan of yours, so I just had to give this recipe a try.  I thought the recipe I already have is good, but I thought Kittencalskitchen meatballs just might be out of this world.  Sad to say Kittencalskitchen, I will be sticking to my other meatball recipe.  But, I am not done with you :-)  I have visited your blog and will continue to do so.  Once again, I think U R an amazing chef!"
532289,69173,2011-09-21,5,I've been using a recipe almost identical to this one for close to 25 years.  I always baked them or pan fried them.  Never again.  I simmered in the sauce for 20 minutes checked the temp and they were done.  I  tasted one and oh my goodness.  They are so soft and moist.  The flavor is nothing compared to being baked in an oven.  I'm going to continue to simmer because I know the longer they are in the pan the better they will taste.  Thanks Kitten for another winner.
529278,69173,2012-02-11,5,"Easy to make, very tasty, nice and moist!  I don't eat frozen meatballs.  These I'll eat!  We used turkey, pork, and beef.  We plan to use these tonight in Kittencal's Appetizer Grape Jelly and Chili Sauce Meatballs or Lil Smokies.  That is, if there are any left......."
133174,69173,2012-07-09,5,These are very good.  I used ground turkey and omitted the milk.  The meatballs were formed and dropped into rapid boiling water for a few minutes to firm up.  They were carefully transferred to a baking sheet and baked for about 20 to 25 minutes.  After cooling the meatballs were frozen for later use.  This is something I will be making again.  Thank you for sharing.
400708,69173,2012-07-12,5,"I saved this recipe so long ago I'd almost forgotten about it.  Finally got around to trying it and it won't take me this long to make it again, and again.  So easy to make, and love that I can freeze them and have them ready for anytime to pull out and serve.  The taste is perfect and goes so well with spagetti but would also be great served on their own, maybe as a sub, so many options and always on the ready in the fridge.  These are going to be a regular in my fridge and always a batch on the ready."
470351,69173,2012-10-18,5,"I'm knee deep in the midst of making these meatballs of yours along with your ground beef sauce.  Dinner is hours away and my husband and I can't keep our hands off either of these recipes!  I consider myself a very experienced cook and have been making my own homemade meatballs and ""gravy"" passed down from my husband's Italian family.  These 2 recipes BLOW THEM AWAY!!  I baked the meatballs and plan to freeze them in ziploc's to drop in to quick meals for my toddlers.  I used extra meat in these meatballs, added crushed red peppers, garli garni seasoning and lots more garlic. I also chose to bake these rather than drop in the sauce since I was saving 1/2 of them for future meals.   The recipe is sheer perfection!!  Thank you so much!  I'll now be looking at all your other recipes for more wonderful treats."
33159,69173,2012-12-28,5,Fabulous!  Really tender & flavourful!  I pre-baked & then kept warm in pizza sauce in the crockpot - served as an appetizer at our Christmas Eve Open House.  All 4 dozen meatballs I made were gobbled up!
55578,69173,2013-04-27,5,I keep having people say how much they loved your meatballs.  ANOTHER winner Kitten :)
191533,69173,2013-08-02,5,"Very good! I discovered that I only had half the amount of parmesan, but I don&#039;t know that it mattered."
350750,69173,2014-01-04,5,"Another 5 stars from this family.  I liked the idea of cooking these in the sauce, which saved another dirty dish.  Thank you!"
486718,69173,2014-02-04,5,These were really yummy! I did brown them first as a matter of preference but didn&#039;t change anything else.  I loved the flavor and the moistness and they were better the next day as leftovers. Thanks!
1581225,69173,2014-08-28,5,"These are great meatballs, very flavourful. Great to make ahead and freeze. A great, reliable family meal."
2549237,69173,2015-02-01,5,These were really delicious and super easy!  I used a full 2 lbs of ground beef (because I&#039;m cheap) and used fresh grated parmesan but followed all of the other ingredients as written.  When it came time to cook the meatball I opted for the oven method and layered in Ragu sauce with the meatballs and baked for 35 minutes.  The came out perfectly cooked and still so moist after cooking.  We used your wonderful meatball recipe to make meatball subs and I plan to use the sauce left in the bottom of the pan to make baked spaghetti casserole tomorrow night.  Thanks for a keep Kittencal!
175824,69173,2016-02-24,5,These meatballs were yummy. I will never make a different meatball again. Follow the recipe exactly. Thanks for posting
315055,69173,2018-12-09,5,"This is our go to meatball recipe. Turns out wonderfully every time! Thanks for another winner, kittencal!"
22015,59635,2003-05-02,5,This was so easy - I divided the recipe and added extra jalapenos to some for those who are more adventuresome.  Thanks for a great recipe.
51011,59635,2005-03-27,5,Yum yum yum!!! This is super good and easy!  I halved the recipe since it was only for the two of us. No changes were necessary- Thanks for sharing!
58836,59635,2006-01-08,5,Made this yesterday to take to a birthday dinner.  Yum Yum.  Didn't have plain tomatoes so used stewed and it was perfect.  Thanks.
278113,59635,2006-01-09,5,"We love this recipe, and have made it several times already. "
8629,59635,2006-01-26,5,"Easy, delicious and fool-proof.  Recommended.   "
55578,59635,2006-02-06,5,"LOVE IT! I used a can of stewed tomatoes and one of Rotel Mexican tomatoes and threw in a can of chopped green chilis. Didn't have the fresh jalapenos, so I used pickled. Didn't use the food processor, I just roughly chopped, but boy what a nice salsa.  The whole family enjoyed this on nachos while watching the Super Bowl.  I wasn't sure if I was to drain the second can of tomatoes, so I did.  We have plenty of salsa leftover, good enough for a Mexican meal tonight.  Thanks!"
145352,59635,2006-02-20,5,Very delicious! I added a tad more jalapeno for some more heat.
286851,59635,2006-03-07,5,"A good, basic salsa recipe. Simple to make and yummy. Makes a mild salsa--I may doctor it up to make it a little hotter next time."
298447,59635,2007-01-04,5,"This salsa is great-- love the texture and the taste.  I have found that adding just a little bit of lemon juice enhances the flavor even more.  The only other thing I might add would be cilantro, but only if I already had it on hand.  I have made this several times and have never been disappointed with the results.  Thx!"
358796,59635,2007-05-04,5,"The salsa snob in me turned my nose up at the idea of making salsa from canned ingredients (gasp). But this is good, especially during winter when fresh toms are not very good. I did use fresh jalapenos and fresh garlic. This tastes like the salsa they serve at many chain restaurants here, not really authentic, but good nonetheless. I might add some cilantro for some more color and flavor and a few dashes of hot sauce to spice it up."
355637,59635,2007-09-30,5,I go to Chili's - just for their salsa... now I can just stay home! Great and easy.
229524,59635,2008-01-06,5,"So easy to make and great flavor. I did add some garlic, cilantro and a little lime juice and a splash of vinegar."
407007,59635,2008-01-12,4,"This was so easy and so tasty! Served it with a nice warm quesadilla and it hit the spot. The only thing I'd change is that next time, I will leave out the sugar, because for me it overpowered the salsa a bit for my personal tastes. Or maybe the addition of extra salt would help. I'll play around with it -- it's a keeper either way!! :)"
187373,59635,2008-01-14,4,"Pretty good salsa. Made some of this to take home over christmas. I did use green chilies in place of the jalapeno, since my mom doesn't like spicy, but man, this was still pretty spicy, even for my standards and I like spicy! I added some fresh cilantro, which I think is a MUST in a good salsa! Thanks for posting."
316717,59635,2008-06-28,5,YUUUUMMM!!! this was a huge hit w/ my picky family. thank you for sharing!
125640,59635,2008-08-10,3,"So quick and easy. The flavor was pretty good, tastes much fresher than I would have expected. I used frozen jalapeÃ±os to use what I had on hand and the higher amount of garlic. I used this salsa in Recipe #307250 which was good. DH didn't seem to like it as much as some other salsas just served with chips though, so I'll keep looking for one he likes better. Thanks for sharing."
37868,59635,2008-11-09,5,"Wonderful Wonderful recipe!! I followed your recipe to the ""T""!   I had everything on hand. This is a must keep and do over and over!! I also made homemade chips Recipe#124908. Snack made in heaven for this household. Thank You and Hugs"
222564,59635,2009-01-27,4,"Good salsa. Little lime juice, cilantro and garlic did add nicely."
315055,59635,2009-02-12,3,"Too much onion flavor overpowered this recipe, granted I'm pregnant so may just be overly sensitive, but my husband said he didn't like it for the same reason so it can't just be me."
55729,59635,2009-03-25,4,"I forgot to buy the jalapenos, so this was a bit too mild. It was very flavorful, and I appreciated how easy it was. It was also the perfect texture. I will definitely not forget the jalapenos next time, and might also add cilantro per my husband's request."
97579,59635,2009-05-03,5,Loved this!  I didn't have a can of tomatos w/green chilies so I used a can of diced tomatos & 1/2 a small can of chilies.  I did add cilantro because I love it.  This was excellent!!!  Will be making this many more times.  Thanks!
140132,59635,2009-06-08,5,I agree that this tastes just like the restaraunts salsa they serve.  I loved how simple and quick this is and it tasted great.  I warmed our tortilla chips up and served as an evening snack.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe.
844554,59635,2010-02-12,5,"Great salsa! Since there's only 2 of us, I only used the 1 can of diced tomatoes and chilies -- everything else was the same except I cut down the amount of jalapenos and it was still spicy! That being said, I'll make this again. We like spicy."
1133190,59635,2010-03-05,5,What a great basic salsa recipe! the only thing I did different was add a little lime juice.  I had to use my blender since I don't have a large enough food processor.  I need to be more careful next time to not let the salsa get quite so liquified.
653438,59635,2010-03-08,5,"This was delicious.  I used a can of rotel with green chilis (for the (14 1/2 oz. can of tomatoes with chilis), 1 1/2 fresh minced jalapenos and I added fresh minced garlic (1 clove), 1 Tbls. fresh lime juice, some fresh minced cilantro and a few sliced green onions (to finish up my onions) to the rest of the ingredients.  Thank you for a very good and basic recipe you can add to or change and it turns out great!"
91392,59635,2011-02-11,5,"Easy, good, make it with things you have at home."
59163,59635,2011-12-16,5,"I just realized I haven't reviewed this. I've been using this for the past year at least. It's so nice that you can usually have all the ingredients on hand, except maybe the jalapeno.  The taste is surprisingly fresh with the use of canned tomatoes.  It only literally takes minutes to make, so you can whip it up in no time.  Great recipe."
103876,59635,2014-01-03,5,"I made this for my son when he was home for college over Christmas break. He loved it and so did I.  I think it tastes very similar to Chili&#039;s and so much better than anything you can buy in a jar.  I omitted the jalapenos, but added some hot spice mix as well as lemon juice and dried cilantro. Thanks for posting!"
180090,110506,2005-05-10,5,"I made these exactly as posted and they were so scrumptious! The only problem I had with them is that they fell apart easily while taking them out of the pan. Next time I make them, I'll use muffin paper liners. I'd recommend eating these on the 2nd day, that's when they taste the best! Thanks for the recipe Dotty! YUM YUM :)"
347822,110506,2006-10-31,3,I agree very moist and not too sweet.  Suggestions - I would cut back on the vegetable oil (muffins had a oil after taste) and add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple mix.
22015,110506,2006-01-31,5,These are wonderful!   I subbed Splenda brown sugar substitute for the brown sugar called for in the recipe.   Next time I may sub some applesauce for part of the oil to reduce the fat and to make these more diabetic friendly.   Thanks for posting.
185446,110506,2006-02-08,5,"I deal with a lot of senior citizens--muffins are big with them, and this has become one of their favorites!  Thanks!!"
89831,110506,2006-04-03,5,"Dotty, these muffins certainly live up to there name! I made these into 8 jumbo muffins and used 3 teaspoons vanilla, I also increased the baking soda to 1-1/2 teaspoon. These are soooooo good! thanks Dotty!...Kitten:)"
280166,110506,2006-12-01,5,"I have been on a muffin kick lately and after trying prob. 8-10 from this site alone, this was my favorite hands down.  Like other reviewers, I added 1 tsp cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg to the batter.  Also added nutmeg to the topping--in addition to the cinnamon. Replaced 1/3 cup of the oil with applesauce and they were still very moist.  Thanks for submitting!"
350750,110506,2007-02-21,5,These were amazing! They tasted great right out of the oven and also the next day.  I will keep this recipe handy.  Thanks for a great recipe.
52543,110506,2007-03-20,5,"With 46 ratings, its very difficult to add any helpful comments! This was an easy recipe which I made with a 9 year old aspiring baker. Since the muffins were all gone in 2 days, they must have been good. I added cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice to the batter ...... I added oatmeal to the topping ......... I replaced half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.
I used muffin tin liners: a dozen went into silpat muffin tins - the paper didn't stick; the other 6 went into regular muffin tins - the paper stuck. I guess you know what I'll be doing next time.
Thanx for posting this repeat recipe Dot!"
255338,110506,2007-03-28,5,"Instead of chopping all the apples, I finely grated half, and finely chopped half. Other than that, followed instructions as posted. Muffins were delicious, but they stuck to the paper cases. Will make again. Thank you for posting."
394077,110506,2007-05-02,5,Absolutely delicious!! I cut down the brown sugar to 1 cup (personal Preference).  These are so moist and wonderful.  I also skipped the topping but add the cinnamon into the batter.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.
149363,110506,2007-07-31,5,"Wonderful muffins! I didn't have enough apples, so I subbed in One cup fresh chopped peaches and they turned out just terrific! These are easy to make and delicious. Thanks for posting!"
252816,110506,2007-08-17,5,"My DH loved these muffins. This recipe made 12 big muffins or 9 Jumbo muffins.I used milk with lemon juice (mix and let set 10 minutes)in place of buttermilk.Otherwise followed recipe...Wonderful flavor and nice and tender.I baked 12 lg muffins at 375 for 23 minute..Remove from pan immediately so they dont stick..I used no stick pans and paper liners..I like taking muffins on camping/fishing trips. I made several different recipes this past week and froze them..I put each into a sandwich bag and mark the flavor on freezer tape to seal each and then place in lg freezer bag seal and freeze.To thaw- take muffin out of sandwich bag and heat in microwave 40 seconds..Taste like fresh baked..I highly recommend this recipe.I have made these muffins many times now. Everyone loves them. I used fuji apples this last time as I had a big bag going soft. I added more apples to the muffins about 3 1/2 cups and they turned  so moist and so yummy...This recipe is laminated,I will be making them alot..."
60260,110506,2007-09-10,5,Excellent muffins.  I used cake spice from Penzey's instead of cinnamon in the topping and then added cinnamon to the batter.  With someone else's suggestion I used 3tsp vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp baking soda.  This recipe made 6 jumbo muffins and 4 regular sized ones.  I might next time add some oatmeal to the crumb topping.  I greased my pans well and did not use paper liners and found that they cooked up perfectly. These will be made again!
33159,110506,2012-10-13,5,"So good!!  Moist, flavourful & delicious!  I grated the apple as suggested by another reviewer & liked the results."
359220,110506,2007-10-13,5,"Gets my 5 stars too!  Threw this together for my husband for drill weekend and was pleased at how quickly they came together.  Smelled wonderful as they baked, very moist about a half hour after they came out of the oven.  I used braeburns, but might look for a sweeter apple next time.  I subbed in half wheat flour for the regular, used margarine instead of butter and about 1/2 cup of oil, though I think I'll try the applesauce next time.  Will definitely be making again and again...so much fresher than a mix!"
251917,110506,2007-10-16,0,"I am not sure what happened but when I made these, the middle sunk and didn't cook through. It was really strange - I followed the directions exactly - no changes!!"
632249,110506,2007-11-22,5,Delightful.  What a nice breakfast on a cold and blustery day like today.
371738,110506,2007-12-02,5,Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.
64203,110506,2008-08-08,5,"I can totally see why this recipe is so popular! Delicious! I added cinnamon to the muffin batter, but that is the only change I made. My muffins were done at 20 minutes. Excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing it!"
229524,110506,2008-05-04,0,Can see why these have only 5 star ratings :)  Love the crunchy topping.  Thanks for sharing Dotty 2 for sharing.
485151,110506,2008-09-12,5,"I have to declare these the best muffins ever! They are way too nummy for my good. All of my kids & friends that have tried them love them, even my son that doesn't like anything with cooked apples! I made them with only a couple minor changes that other reviewers suggested.

I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. (Next time I think I might cut back to 3/4 c and see if I can tell the difference.) I used 1 cup of milk soured with 1 Tbs of lemon juice as a substitute for the buttermilk. I accidentally used only 1/3 cup of oil because I intended to use 1/3 c of applesauce too, but forgot.

I used some homemade cake release to grease the muffin tins. My first batch was slightly overbaked (still tasted good- just too brown). So I lowered the temp to 325 and baked the second batch for about 20 minutes. That was perfect for my oven. I made 15 regular size muffins and 12 mini muffins (I baked them for 15 minutes.)

The tops of some of my muffins kind of caved in the middle a little like a volcano for some reason. I'm not sure why- but it didn't affect the taste at all. Next time I might add some baking powder to see if that helps them dome right. And more apples and a little more cinnamon too I think."
264017,110506,2008-11-24,5,"Considering I'm the 130th reviewer for these delectable muffins, I'm jumping on the ship to say they are nothing short of TERRIFIC! I combined several hints of other reviewers including adding 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter, 2 teaspoons baking powder to the flour mix, grated the apple and cut the amount of brown sugar down to 1 cup. I also added 1/4 cup oatmeal to the topping mixture. I had 6 jumbo muffins and 6 regular size. Most will be enjoyed by a friend who just had surgery. Thanks Dotty!"
315055,110506,2009-10-06,5,"These were great, but the cooking time was too long, the bottoms burned, so I would reduce cooking time by 5 mins and then keep an eye on them.  A lot of people asked for the recipe for these!"
222970,110506,2009-11-11,4,Good muffins. The topping carmelized a bit which made them taste like the Cinnamon Crunch bagels from Panera.
439797,110506,2009-11-20,5,Yum.  I already had some leftover topping that I used.  The muffins were delicious.  Froze the leftovers.
32058,110506,2010-03-08,5,Yummo I made these in Wilton's jumbo muffin pans and added caramel bits. Baked 10 minutes longer.
158086,110506,2010-10-05,5,Wonderful muffins!  I doubled the recipe and used honeycrisp apples...
15521,110506,2010-11-28,5,"Super muffins!  The cute name caught my attention, but the delicious flavor of these muffins will have me making them again. I did run a little short on the topping, so next time I will start off putting less on then add more if I have it at the end. They weren't difficult to make and baked up moist and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing!"
191533,110506,2012-01-30,4,"Very good! Not great, I think- The muffins are very good because of the apples. I would like more flavor in the actual muffin- maybe more spices? They weren't too dry and the topping was SUPERB!"
126440,110506,2012-02-19,5,"We loved these muffins.  I used four apples, grated and was out of butter.  Served with egg, sausage scramble."
540346,110506,2012-10-11,5,"These muffins were delicious.  I one and a halved the recipe and got 24 muffins.  Although I one and a halved most of the ingredients, I did not add extra sugar or topping.  I also used whole wheat flour and 2/3 c applesauce and only 1/3 c oil.  They were moist and delicious and I will definitely make again."
1052873,110506,2013-09-22,5,"These tasted fabulous! Used homemade applesauce instead of the oil. A little too thin I think, The muffins were a little too moist. Because I saved those calories, I doubled the topping. That was too much topping."
839492,110506,2014-04-25,5,"I left off the topping entirely. I shredded the apple, added 1/3 c. Quick cooking oatmeal"
35526,64203,2003-06-22,5,"Just for the record, I used a can of Tropical fruit salad, ""Fun Sea Shapes"" instead of the pineapple.  It is just papaya and pineapple cut into ""fun sea shapes"".  I did not know if you were surpose to drain it so I did.  I also used key lime juice because that is what I had.  We loved this salad, very different and tasty.  Leftovers for lunch was very good the next day.  "
9869,64203,2003-10-15,5,"Delicious colourful salad. I didnt have any raisins so subbed sultanas.
We really liked the flavours in the dressing, tart, sweet with that hint of ginger..scrummy!"
4470,64203,2010-05-25,5,"Delightful lunch.  The dressing is wonderful. You just need a wee amount. I cut the recipe back to one serving.
 Doesn't this look like a Walking on Sunshine salad?  Colorful makes it eye candy and taste wise MMmmm the ginger lime with a touch of honey  is wonderful"
22015,14106,2002-01-02,5,"Excellent!   I wouldn't change a thing.  However, I ended up using 3 tortillas.  It's very important to not place the roast beef close to the edge because your rolls won't ""seal"" if you place it clear to the edge."
13483,14106,2002-01-17,5,"Easy, fast and do ahead. . . everything I like!  I added some Dijon mustard as well and a little more horseradish than called for.  Worked very well.  I bet these would freeze well too??
Thanks again Dorothy."
46660,14106,2003-03-17,4,"These were pretty good.  I didn't really like the cream cheese, I think it overpowered the horseradish-roast beef flavor.  I added lettuce and tomato, as we were eating them for lunch.  Dipped them in some Horsey Sauce, that made a difference.  I think maybe that is what I will use next time instead of the cream cheese.  "
101823,14106,2005-07-30,5,This is a keeper!  The blend of flavors is excellent.  Even those that don't care for horseradish love these.  I did have enough filling to spread over 5 tortillas and offered these little slices on an appetizer buffet.  These were by far the favorite roll-up of the night.
119466,14106,2005-08-27,5,"Fantastic flavor--we loved them! I used jalapeno-cheddar tortillas and fat-free cream cheese. If these were being made for guests, I would probably go ahead and use regular cream cheese, but since I was making them for my family and wanted to cut the fat/calories a bit, I used fat-free and it worked out fine.These would also be nice to pack for lunches, maybe cutting the rolls in half rather than slices.  Thanks, Derf--I'll definitely be making these again."
51011,14106,2006-06-16,4,"I made these for a potluck at school, and to be honest- people liked the others I made a bit better.  I am going to try them again with a different brand of roast beef to see if that helps.  Thanks for sharing!  "
140132,14106,2007-04-15,4,We made these as an appy on Easter.  I loved the flavor for these with the horseradish.  I will be making these again as they were a big hit.  I only used regular flour tortillas but will try the mentioned cheese flavored ones next.  I want to thank you for this very attractive looking appy that you make ahead of time which is always a plus.....Stephanie
125640,14106,2007-05-21,4,"Easy and tasty. I used onion and chive cream cheese cause it's what I had on hand, so I left out the green onion, but added the parsley anyway. I made one wrap with the horseradish and one without. I didn't actually try the one without, but DH liked it. Thanks for sharing. This was yummy."
145352,14106,2007-07-03,4,These were very good. I served them as a sandwich. I added some fresh spinach leaves and some provolne cheese. I love the kick of the horseradish!
74281,14106,2007-10-22,5,"I have to join the other 63 people on this recipe and say it is FABULOUS! I took this to an appetizer/dessert party on Saturday and everyone loved them! I thought about what to do with all of that wonderful liquid that was extracted from the horseradish (I used 3 Tablespoons of horseradish) and decided to make a ""dipping sauce"". I used 1/2 cup of sour cream, the horseradish liquid, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt and mixed them well together. It turned out to be a really good compliment to the Spirals. SO easy I will make these often!"
231054,14106,2007-12-30,5,"Another great recipe, Derf!  I made these for a Holiday Cocktail party we  had and our guests really enjoyed them.  I got 3 tortillas out of it instead of the 2 -- but now I realize I should have followed your instructions and stuck with the two.  I think using the 3 sort of skimped on the cream cheese filling a little more than should be.  If I feel I need more spirals, I'll just double the recipe.  Thank you for helping me out!"
377581,14106,2008-01-24,4,These make wonderful make ahead appetizers. Very easy to make and taste really good. Great for a party or just as a snack. Thanks!
60260,14106,2008-01-28,4,"Very good appetizer! I loved the zip the horseradish adds to this yummy treat.  I made mine the day ahead and found that my tortillas became a little ""damp"" from the moisture.  I made sure there wasn't any liquid in the horseradish sO I think the next time I serve these, I will make them in the morning or just a few hours before the party vs. the day before."
60992,14106,2008-06-08,4,"These were great! We really enjoy horseradish, but I think this needs just a ""leetle"" something to counterbalance it in this recipe. It made great lunches, we got 4 tortillas worth from this recipe. I used garlic and pesto tortillas which are yummy, but I think I would like the filling and meat flavors to come through more."
486718,14106,2008-12-27,5,"Wow, this was my first time making spirals and they came out great.  I made these for Christmas Eve and everybody loved them.  Thanks!!"
136997,14106,2009-01-02,5,Perfect little bite which I added to my appy plate for our New Years Eve celebration. I used regular flour tortillas. Delicious! :)
389431,14106,2009-02-07,5,"I made these for my grandfathers funeral and everyone really seemed to like them!
Super easy to make... perfect finger food...
The only thing I changed was...I used horseradish sauce (boars head) instead of grated... no draining needed!!  Worked wonderfully!!  Tasted fabulous!
Thanks so very much!!"
1122161,14106,2009-10-05,5,"These were very good appetizers! Easy to put together, and so tasty! We were joking around this weekend and were calling them ""pig rolls"" because we made real pigs of ourselves with these!! Thanks for the recipe! :)"
64642,14106,2009-12-13,5,Excellent recipe.  Followed it as written.  Quite easy to do.
318235,14106,2010-02-23,5,So good! I made these as a wrap for lunch. They were fantastic. It is a great recipe to pre-make to use throughout the week. Thank you! Update 2/23/10: I made these again because we enjoyed them so much last week. This time I used smoked salmon because I needed to use up some that I had in the fridge and it was fabulous. Thanks again!
262312,14106,2010-03-02,5,"these were scarffed down quickly at my super bowl party!  i used whipped cream cheese that had chives in it but still added more green onions, etc.  i made these up with sun dried tomato basil tortillas (i used 3 instead of 2).  i made these up a day ahead of time and was pleased to have an appy that didn't need to be baked!  i sliced them up in the morning and went ahead and put on serving platter.  all i had to do was pull out of the fridge at party time!  thanks for another winner derf!"
60989,14106,2010-05-17,5,These are fabulous. The kick that the horseradish brings is just great. The husband raved about them. Thanks!
15521,14106,2011-12-04,4,Nice make ahead appetizer. Would especially be nice in the Summer.  I would add more horseradish next time.  I like mine to have a bite!
928301,14106,2012-06-28,5,"I like it.  I was afraid it wouldn't hold, but it worked out great."
222564,14106,2014-02-15,4,Got to love them!
169969,132764,2006-01-12,5,Great Salad!!! So easy with so few ingredients but really wonderful! I added cracked pepper and some fresh thyme to the dressing (and chose mayo over miracle whip). I used red leaf lettuce and spun it in the salad spinner.. so crisp and sooo good! Thanks Hope!
89831,132764,2006-01-18,5,"My DH loved this for lunch!, not only is it a pretty salad it is delicious, I used navel oranges in place of mandarin, and used mayo, just delicious! thanks Mama!...Kitten:)"
8629,132764,2006-02-01,5,"We both enjoyed this salad. I did as Rita L. and added 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt. and fresh cracked pepper to the mayo."
128473,132764,2007-03-16,5,"Wow! This was wonderful. I really enjoyed this easy to make salad, the flavours and textures were great. I made this recipe as stated. I love the combination of juicy mandarin oranges, sweet red onions and crisp lettuce, with a simple sweet and tangy dressing. Thanks for sharing mama's kitchen."
133174,132764,2007-05-25,5,This is a quick and delicious salad.  It was easily made with things I had on hand.  The dressing is light and makes for a pleasing flavor combination.  This recipe is easily scaled to smaller servings.  Made for ZWTIII.
227607,132764,2007-06-06,5,This was really yummy.  I will make this often.  Next time I think I will try it with my vegenaise. Made for zwt 07
136997,132764,2007-06-11,4,Nice refreshing salad. Had to leave out the onions though. Our daughter won't eat them. Made for ZWT 3. :)
386849,132764,2008-04-29,5,"Great, simple salad and dressing.  Will definitely make again!"
461834,132764,2008-09-26,5,"Great quick and simple salad to get together.  I subbed green onion for the red as it is what I had on hand, otherwise, followed as written.  Then to my serving I added a little salt and pepper.  Thanks for sharing a great salad recipe.  Made for bevy tag."
383346,132764,2008-11-24,5,I omitted the onion but next time I'll try it with green onion.  I used mayonnaise.  This was really good.  Thanks Hope.  Made for Beverage tag.
173579,132764,2009-04-16,5,Very nice mandarin orange salad.  Loved how all the flavors  came together.  It was also quick and easy.  Thanks for posting this lovely salad.
88099,132764,2009-09-26,5,Excellent salad.  Loved the mandarin oranges.  The dressing was just wonderful.  So simple yet full of flavor.  I'll make this one again.  Thanks Hope Made for PAC Fall 09 :)
324621,58836,2006-08-08,4,"The sauce was fantastic - very rich and tasty. But the chicken didn't have much flavor. Still very good and worth a try, but I prefer chicken that picks up more flavor from the sauce."
13483,42169,2002-10-17,5,"Really easy to do and turned out really good.  Did this as a ""candle light and wine"" dinner and it worked like a charm.  Thanks Marie"
27643,42169,2002-10-30,5,"Absolutely, without a doubt, the best shrimp we have ever had!!! I made these with no additions or substitutions. They are wonderful!! Thanks Marie!! I will make these a lot!!"
8629,42169,2003-09-01,5,"Absolutely fabulous!  I followed the directions exactly and the shrimps just melted in my mouth.  I used a parchment lined 9"" square baking pan.  12 shrimps fit perfectly in 3 rows of 4 shrimps.  Company-worthy. Will make again as soon as the shrimp goes on sale.  Thank you for a great recipe."
95743,42169,2003-12-08,5,Superb!  Wanted to see if this recipe would make good appetizers if smaller shrimp were used.  It does!  I used one pound of 41-50 count shrimp and the other ingredients and quantities as written.  They baked in five minutes and were outstanding.
68960,42169,2004-01-17,5,This has got to be one of our favourite recipes.  I made this exactally as written using king prawns and served with a salad.  Thank you marie for a fantastic recipe.  We will use this alot.
47559,42169,2004-03-21,5,"Another 5 star review.  I didn't change a thing, and everyone loved them.  When you combine simplicity and outstanding flavor you have a winner - and this is it."
68460,42169,2004-03-27,5,Definitely worth the 5 stars!  So easy and so tasty.  I used panko (Japanese) breadcrumbs and the shrimp came out nice and crisp.  We had these with french fries and cole slaw for a great dinner!  Thanks marie for a great recipe.
146486,42169,2004-08-02,5,I made these for dinner last night and thought they were probably the best shrimp I have ever had!!  They were easy to make and got 5 stars from my fiance too!!
26512,42169,2004-08-08,5,"Outstanding shrimp! This was so simple to make and the flavor is delicious. I added more garlic, but other than that, didn't change a thing and can't see any reason to do so. We really enjoyed this and will make often. Thanks for posting!"
13796,42169,2004-09-07,5,Ok.. another review..   I know it doesn't need it but I made these last week and they were delicious. I didn't have unseasoned bread crumbs so I used Italian Style crumbs and the shrimp were very good.
158086,42169,2004-09-08,5,"i made these for labor day weekend as we had company, and i had to give them the recipe...it was a huge hit and looked like it took me all day to make...fantastic"
7108,42169,2004-10-21,5,"Excellent!  Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  My husband loved these, thanks!"
173314,42169,2005-01-27,5,SOOOOOO delicious!  I had gone out to eat and ordered shrimp parmesan and when I found this recipe I knew it would be great.  I served it with the classic baked spaghetti #32731 and the shrimp dissapeared...will be making very very often.  Thanks marie!
37036,42169,2005-02-23,5,"Delicious!  I got home late from work and was really tired, so I didn't allow the shrimp to refrigerate for 30 minutes.  I let them soak for about 5 minutes at room temperature, then proceeded to step 7.  Served with a baked potato and a fresh tossed salad.  Thanks Marie for another great recipe!"
103876,42169,2005-04-16,4,The shrimp turned out crispy and flavorful.  I served with with steak and it went over well.
132383,42169,2005-06-04,5,We have made this probably a dozen times and the only thing we have started doing lately is squeezing lemon and lime on the shrimp before eating.  Wow!
88099,42169,2005-12-30,5,"I'll add my 5 stars to this one.  I did add the juice of a half of lemon to the olive oil, garlic mixture, but other than that made as directed.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks so much for a great recipe."
36944,42169,2006-03-28,5,"I prepared this for my DH as I don't eat shrimp.  I used 12 41-60 count shrimp amd marinated them in 1 Tblsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 1 fresh clove minced garlic and some fresh ground black pepper for about 2-3 hours.  I used about 1/4 cup breadcrumbs (Quick bread crumbs for Casseroles recipe #57875 which I had in the freezer - great recipe!) and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.  I baked them 10 minutes.  My DH loved them.  Said the flavor was outstanding!  They were pretty easy to prepare, especially since I did the first part of the prep earlier in the day.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Marie!"
40961,42169,2006-06-19,5,I made this recipe for part of Father's day dinner. I used frozen cooked shrimp and doubled the ingredients. It was easy and delicious and it tastes like you worked much harder than you did! It deserves more than 5 stars. Thanks for sharing.
227607,42169,2006-10-03,5,I cannot even begin to describe how wonderful this is...it deserves 100 stars.  It is soo easy and unbelievably good.  It was devoured.  I did put the oven on broil for a few minutes at the end so it would brown up a little. WONDERFUL!!!If you have'nt tried this you MUST!!!
160974,42169,2006-11-07,5,"These were every bit as good as I had hoped!I lined the baking sheet with  Pam sprayed foil. Can't wait to make these again! Thanks so much, Marie.

Roxygirl"
140806,42169,2006-12-27,5,DH loved this recipe! We used it for our traditional Xmas eve seafood extravaganza. He liked it much better than fried shrimp. We used regular sized shrimp. DH recommends pulling the tails off before baking for easier eating.
121185,42169,2007-02-17,4,Really good!  Be suer to coat them VERY lightly - the ones that had a bit heavier coating were soggy.  Thanks!  YUM!
402559,42169,2007-02-18,5,"I am not a fan of seafood but my husband loves seafood and my 2 yr old was undecided until tonight. We all loved this, thanks so much for sharing the recipe!"
47907,42169,2007-03-11,5,I made these for dinner last night and they were wonderful!  I used 1 pound of medium shrimp and it worked out fine.  These would make great appetizers as well.  Thanks for posting!
316717,42169,2007-03-11,5,this was pretty good. paired it w/ lemon flavored noodles. yum. so easy too! i mine turned out perfectly crisp even w/ butter drizzled on top. just had to broil it in the end. squirt of lemon b4 serving made it even more perfect. thanks for sharing!
280166,42169,2007-08-13,4,These were very tasty and an easy weeknight meal. I tossed my shrimp with lemon juice prior to breading so they would stay crisp.  Thanks for posting!
324621,42169,2007-09-11,5,These were simple to make and very good! A nice change from the usual beef or chicken meals we usually have too. I served with multigrain rolls and some fruit salad. Yummy meal!
218535,42169,2007-10-23,5,"This was delicious. To make it a bit more healthy, we skipped the butter and use half the parmesan cheese."
140132,42169,2008-01-20,4,"very good.  Iwill continue to make shrimp this was....thank you, Stephanie"
248023,42169,2008-03-03,5,Great alternative to fried shrimp!!!  I used some extra large shrimp with tails on and some romano cheese along with the parmesan...  I made these for my BF for Valentine's Day and we both loved them... He thought they tasted better than fried shrimp and I loved the fact that they were so much easier to prepare and cook... and healthier than deep frying!  I loved how the sweetness and tenderness of the shrimp really came through when prepared this way!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!
470351,42169,2008-03-03,4,I was sitting on the fence between a 3 or 4 rating for this recipe and gave the recipe the benefit of the doubt in the event it was my doing that caused my shrimp to be soggy and not crispy like others commented they achieved.  I added extra garlic and used italian bread crumbs since that's all I had on hand.  I also used smaller sized shrimp since it was all I had and another reviewed said hers turned out great in a smaller size.  This was definitely tasty...but the sogginess kind of took away from it for me.  The fresh lemon at the end is a definite must and probably was the determining factor in giving this 4 stars.  I may attempt this again after reading all reviews to see what I can do differently to avoid the soggy breading.  Still a good recipe.  Thanks for posting.
286851,42169,2008-03-08,4,"I thought this was an easy recipe and it has a good flavor. I followed the directions exactly. Like the last reviewer ChicagoRN, I too debated between 3 and 4 stars--I also had trouble with the outside ""crust"" being soggy--my didn't crisp at all. The soggy texture bothered me, but my husband really enjoyed it regardless. I too will try to play with the recipe to see if I can figure out how to crisp it up."
426903,42169,2008-03-27,5,"Oh my gosh...so tasty. I did not have jumbo shrimp, so I used medium shrimp. Needless to say I am sure the bigger shrimp is easier to work with. My husband and I do not like having to pull tails off the shrimp, so I usually do that before I cook them. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was tasty. My oven made the bottoms of the shrimp a little too cooked, so I think next time I will put them on for a minute or two less. Oh, and instead of drizzling butter, I used spray butter instead. Made it very easy to cover the pan. Thanks for posting."
632249,42169,2008-04-09,5,"Delicious and quick to prepare.  I made as written, however, I also broiled for about 2 minutes to crisp the breading. Awesome!!!"
269331,42169,2008-07-31,5,"These where awesome, the only dilemma I had was to use cooked or raw shrimp.  I used cooked, peeled and divined clausal shrimp.  They worked out fine, but will try raw next time to see if they come out a bit more tender.  I drizzled the melted butter over the shrimp after they were baked.  Thanks, I will be making this dish over and over again!"
178742,42169,2008-08-25,5,"UMMMM! These were SOOOOO GOOD!! Turned out perfect! I used 1LB of jumbo shrimp, Panko breadcrumbs, and added a few dashes of hot sauce.. but not enough because they were not spicy. Also in the marinade, I sprinkled about 1/2 tbsp dry basil. We didn't even use cocktail sauce, cause they were so good they didnt need ANYTHING. Oh, one more thing, I did as one of the reivewers said.. I put oven on BROIL, and timer for 10 minutes, and after 5 minutes, i turned the shrimp over. I will do 2lbs SHRIMP next time, because we COULD NOT GET ENOUGH!
Thanks for sharing..."
173579,42169,2009-01-09,5,Nice tasting shrimp.  So quick and easy.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
180090,42169,2009-03-05,5,These were delicious! I added about a teaspoon of Old Bay to the marinade. My shrimp were medium sized so I baked them for about 7 minutes. We really enjoyed this! Thanks for the recipe!
126440,42169,2009-03-15,5,"I have made these a couple of times and they are just great.  I served them with Recipe #51504 and Recipe #50847.  Great, easy meal."
242484,42169,2009-04-08,5,Excellent!! Paired mine with a nice green salad with mandarin oranges & cranberries in it.  A nice light meal but very satisfying.
1506604,42169,2010-06-19,5,"YUMM!!! So easy and without frying. Don't need as much breadcrumbs and parmesan as directed. I sifted some of the parmesan from the breadcrumb mixture and sprinkle it on my shrimp before putting it in the oven. I will be making these again really soon. Also, using larger shrimp is the best way to go with this recipe."
39301,42169,2011-09-18,5,Fantastic!  My son and I (the only shrimp lovers in the house) gobbled up a whole recipe of this ourselves.  This is my new favorite shrimp recipe.  Thank you for sharing it here.
29014,42169,2012-11-16,0,"This was SO good!  The shrimp I had were huge (6 to a pound) so I wasn't sure what to do with them.  Since they were twice the size of those specified in the recipe, I just butterflied them and followed the recipe as written.  Wonderful baked at 450 for about 11 minutes.  This is a keeper ~ WHEN we can afford these huge shrimps:)"
42720,42169,2017-08-14,5,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this delicious recipe. I basically followed the recipe but I had to make a substitution and use shredded Parmesan. I made fresh bread crumbs and just threw the shredded Parmesan into the processor with the bread so it would have a texture similar to the grated. I butterflied our shrimp because they were really jumbo. Lightly battered as directed and put them on a foil lined and lightly oiled pan before drizzling with the butter. I baked them about 13-14 minutes. I will be making this one again and again!
128473,42169,2017-11-30,5,"Wow, did we ever enjoy the shrimp prepared this way. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe that has made it into my Best of Cookbook for 2017. Kudos to you... The shrimp were incredible, perfectly cooked, flavorful and had a wonderful texture. Made for What's on the Menu? Tag Game."
280271,42169,2018-01-24,5,These are so yummy and crispy...I just squeezed a bit of lemon juice on them...they are a keeper...made for &quot;the best of 2017&quot; tag game...
482376,42169,2018-02-24,5,"Absolutely delicious!! I loved this style for cooking shrimp. The shrimp were crispy on the outside and very tasty! Next time, I'll skip adding salt since the Parmesan provides enough. Thank you for a great recipe! A winner for sure!"
198154,42169,2018-09-17,4,"I had to use gluten free bread crumbs due to a family member's gluten intolerance, but otherwise followed the recipe. They turned out great and were enjoyed by all. Served with a side of garlic chive noodles."
54678,63786,2004-03-02,5,We love fajitas and this tasted great. We used moose and marinated for couple hours.
59780,63786,2004-08-04,5,"DH had a busy and long day today and I decided to treat him to one of his favourite restaurant meals-steak fajitas. He hadn't even swallowed the first bit and he was already saying ""MMMMMM...."" I picked some hot peppers from our garden and added those to the meat mixture along with the onions and green peppers. DH was thankful for this special meal and I have you to thank for the recipe ;) "
47907,63786,2005-05-05,5,"These fajitas are excellent!  I doubled the marinade, added the chicken strips, and put it int he fridge for a couple of hours.  The chicken is very flavorful ~ everyone had seconds and thirds!  Thank you for posting a keeper!"
9869,63786,2005-05-18,5,"I used rump steak and marinated for a couple of hours before cooking.
One of my favourite meals, thanks for sharing."
60989,63786,2006-02-23,5,"I must add yet another 5* review. Beyond wonderful. I made this with chicken, marinated overnight, prechopped the veggies, and when I came home it only took 15 minutes to throw together. Everyone had seconds. Thanks!"
49304,63786,2006-03-29,5,"Excellent Fajitas, I used some leftover Tri-tip roast, marinated like the recipe said even though it was already cooked, then prepared as stated. My DH said these were GREAT fajitas. I will be making this recipe again using steak as the recipe calls for. Thanks Rhonda, for posting this recipe."
55729,63786,2006-06-03,0,"I ended up changing these quite a bit - I planned on doubling the seasonings because I had twice the meat, but I hadn't printed the recipe that way. So I accidentally quadrupled the chili powder. As a result, I decided to omit the pepper flakes and black pepper. I did not double the peppers, and I didn't use any onion (your recipe didn't say how much to use, and we don't really like onion). The results were outstanding! I will definitely make this again with the proper seasoning. I did like the double meat."
316717,63786,2007-02-08,5,"omigoodness is this goooooooooood. so tasty and just delicious. can i say enough about it? so EASY and fast to make. omitted the pepper flakes, used chicken breasts and man o man was this a meal! will most definately make this again and will try beef next time. btw..i marinated mine for about 2 hours."
373817,63786,2007-02-14,5,"I wish I could give these more than 5 stars!!! I used chicken, and I let it marinate for 5 hours. My husband just kept saying how much he really liked the lime flavor in the chicken. These also went over very well with my 2 year old! This is a great recipe and I will definitely make this again....probably sometime soon! :)"
64203,63786,2007-03-04,5,These are better than any restaurant fajitas I have ever had. The spice and intensity of the flavors is just right. Easy to put together and makes a wonderful meal. Thank you!
231054,63786,2007-04-02,5,"I thought I had already submitted a review of this recipe -- but apparently not.  These are so good!  I have only made them with the chicken (but I'm sure the steak or even pork would be just as tasty).  I have a large jar of Penzeys Fajita Seasoning on hand, so I added about a tablespoon of it to the other ingredients.  I also love the lime juice, so added an extra tablespoon of it as well.  Just prior to removing the mixture from the skillet, I sliced a couple tomatoes into thin wedges and added them to the mixture.  These are not only delicious, but pretty quick to make (but allow for the extra time if you should want to marinate the meat).  In order to cut calories, I had the leftovers over some lettuce (sort of made a Fajita Salad).  Rhonda, thank you for posting this recipe."
93006,63786,2007-04-06,4,"Even with all the good reviews, was not expecting this recipe to be that good.  Since the meat doesn't marinate long, I thought it would tough, etc.  Much to my surprise these were very good fajitas!  Am trying to use stuff in the freezer, and had some sirloin, so that's what I used, and they were terrific!  This is a great recipe when you are looking for something quick and satisfying!"
324621,63786,2007-05-09,5,"Excellent!! Wow! These were GREAT!! I used chicken and these was by far rhe best fajita I've ever had! I did marinate the meat for an hour and I left out the hot pepper flakes for the kids' sake, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Wonderful dinner tonight! I'm looking forward to finishing off the leftovers for luch tomorrow and can't wait to make these again!"
140132,63786,2007-08-23,4,"We used sirloin steak and they were delicious.  I thought they were a breeze to prepare and the taste was very good.  Thank you for something a little different from our ""usual"".   Stephanie"
394077,63786,2008-05-28,5,I used regular beef chuck but I marinated it with the lime for about 3 hours and it was so tender.  So good and so easy.  Thank you for the recipe.
377581,63786,2008-06-26,5,"These were very good fajitas! I used some steak that had been in the freezer for a while. They came out very tender and flavorful. The marinade has a delicious smoky, spicy flavor. This is a quick and easy, very enjoyable meal. Thank you for posting!"
251626,63786,2008-11-30,5,These are really excellent. I made them with both chicken and beef and they were delicious both ways.
808027,63786,2009-01-09,0,"I guess I was expecting more after all the rave reviews, but we found these to be a bit bland...definitely in need of some spicing up.  But a good basic recipe that you could easily adapt to your own tastes."
55578,63786,2009-06-08,5,Great recipe.  I used a very hot cast iron pan to sear first the veggies and then the meat.  I really threw all veggies together took them out and then did the meat then put them back together to sizzle some more.  Use a cast iron pan at a high temp and you will really enjoy the results!
185446,63786,2009-06-18,5,"I was looking for a quick, tasty fajita--this does the trick.  Looking at all the good reviews, I am not alone.  Thanks, Rhonda J."
222970,63786,2009-07-10,5,"Very good. Very quick. I like that it doesn't have to be marinated but is as good as if it had been.

Instead of the lime juice I used a couple of packets of True Lime and it worked just fine."
229850,63786,2009-07-22,4,"I made this as written, but for some reason we were not crazy about the pepper, I did use a sweet yellow. I think I may try it again, using half of a pepper, double the onions and maybe chicken, as I used sirloin this time. Thank you for letting us try this."
439797,63786,2009-07-23,5,"We loved this.  Everything about it was perfect.  I just realized I forgot the garlic.  But I did everything else as written.  My husband says they are the ""best non-restaurant"" fajitas ever!"
879716,63786,2009-07-30,5,So simple and perfect.  I love the quick marinade - used it on chicken and it gave it a really great flavor in very little time.  Made for a yummy and fast dinner... well especially fast since I already had peppers cut up in the freezer and onion sliced in the fridge.  Thanks Rhonda!
111291,63786,2009-08-13,5,easy and yummalicious!!  will make this again.  thanks for posting.
199020,63786,2009-09-01,5,"Wow! These fajitas are delicious! Just as good or better than any I have had in any restaurant. So far, I have only made them with chicken, but I can't wait to try steak! This recipe is going in my favorites file! Thanks!"
368078,63786,2009-09-04,5,"10+. My DH said ""This is the only fajita recipe I want to make from now on...and we need to make them more often"" if that tells you anything :).  We used 1 red and 1 green pepper, 1 yellow onion and 1/2 lb chicken, and substituted lemon juice for lime juice.  The flavor was so complex - perfect!  Thanks, Rhonda!"
914720,63786,2009-11-04,5,This was nice - and I loved that I had most ingredients on hand.  (Although I did sub lemon juice for the lime juice.)  Quick to prepare.  I used chicken - can't wait to try the steak.  Thanks for posting!
269331,63786,2010-01-08,5,"I used 2 large chicken steaks that I sliced thin.  The chicken came out nice and tender and the flavors were fantastic.  I also used a pasilla chili instead of bell pepper and served the onion/chili mixture separate, rather than mixing it together with the chicken.   My toppings were sliced avocado, cheese, salsa and cilantro.   Really easy to make!  YUMMM, I will be making this again!"
377039,63786,2010-02-17,5,"Excellent. I used chicken, and was out of cumin (subbed extra chili powder) and lime juice (subbed lemon with a small splash of orange).  It was delicious.  Despite the hot pepper, there was no heat to this recipe -- lots of flavor, but no heat.  This was perfect for us; my husband added jalepenos to his portion, while I loved mine just as it was!  (Note to self, use only 1/2 an onion, a whole one was too much for us)"
894666,63786,2011-01-25,5,Found your recipe a couple years ago and it has been my go-to for fajitas ever since! My only change is I use half homemade ancho chili powder for the plain chili powder for a bit more smoky flavor. Love!!!!
1269015,63786,2011-01-22,4,I made a vegetarian version by subbing the beef for black beans. So good! This will be my go-to recipe for fajita/taco nights from now on.
810787,63786,2011-01-31,4,It was good but we still haven't found one that replicates the ones in a restaurant.
44383,63786,2011-07-15,5,Made this tonight as directed but with chicken. So good!! Thanks for posting this great easy recipe.
1072593,63786,2011-08-28,5,The family had that look like when you throw a handful of crumbs at a bunch of pigeons.  They all swoop into a pile knocking each other over to get there first and fight for the best spot.
937635,63786,2011-11-29,0,Easy & quick but not as much flavor as id hoped.
1179225,63786,2012-02-06,4,Really good and easy to put together. Thanks for posting!
307214,63786,2014-03-23,5,"No conversation at the table tonight - too busy eating.  A quick, tasty and healthy meal.  I did use chicken instead of beef.  Next time, I will try beef..."
37449,9272,2002-04-17,5,"I have made alot of salsa, and this is excellent.
I couldn't find my cumin, and didn't have fresh
jalapenos,so I used some pickled and it still
turned out great! Thanks."
52543,9272,2003-02-07,5,"I've made several batches & varied the peppers & heat depending on what was available from our vegetable garden at the time. It made a unique ""hostess"" gift, along with a bag of tortilla chips  & a couple of nacho recipes. Definitely a keeper!!"
52125,9272,2003-07-25,5,Everyone that said 5 st*rs is right! This taste wonderful! I had a little leftover to sample before canning 6 pints and it tasted great. Thanks Dorene Nelson....
37036,9272,2003-08-06,5,Excellent salsa recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing!
101034,9272,2003-12-23,5,"This was perfection!!! It doesn't get any better. What a great recipe. It puts the store bought stuff to shame. You should be out there selling this stuff.....I know I'd buy it. Great Salsa, Thank you"
68960,9272,2004-08-06,5,I don't think I will ever buy salsa again.  What a fabulous recipe.  I make this to freeze.  I increased the cumin powder slightly as we like a hotter salsa.  Can't wait to try this with my favourite salsa chicken crockpot recipe #52828.
168462,9272,2005-08-16,5,This possible the best salsa we have ever eaten. I left out the cumin as we do not like the taste of it. Next time I may use a little less sugar as I think my tomatoes were were  quite sweet by themselves. I used extra jalapeno pepper to make it hotter. Thanks for the recipe.
189616,9272,2005-09-06,5,"Delicious! When I make another batch next year I will decrease the sugar to around 1/4 cup for I found it sweeter than what I'm used to.
Excellent post Jazze22- Thank You very much for sharing this"
185285,9272,2005-10-01,5,"This really is a great recipe.  I am somone who always tries to add more spices, etc - and this one (given the reviews) I left alone and was amazed.  It's a sweet-spicey kinda salsa that DH and I (who both have very different tastes) enjoyed."
315055,9272,2006-05-01,5,"This recipe was very easy to make and I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  This was my first canning experience.  The only bummer was that out of the 8 pints this made, I only have 2 left as everyone wanted a jar!!!"
49304,9272,2006-10-12,5,"I Made this Salsa for the first Yesterday, It is a GREAT recipe,easy to make. taste great. I only used 2 Jalapeno Peppers,also 1/4 cup cilantro.  I will be making lots of it as our tomatoes are just comung on & our grand children all love salsa.Will make their's HOTTER they all love HOT Salsa.I have canned salsa before , but , not as good as this. Thanks for GREAT the recipe.
UPDATE: I have made this salsa recipe for several years now. Everyone loves it. Makes great gifts!"
222564,9272,2007-01-22,5,"Wow, great stuff! Just like our favorite salsa from the shop, which they all of sudden don't make anymore. This recipe is a real savior for us! I did not add tomato sauce, as it was all looking good and saucy enough, without it.
As I was making a lot smaller portion for trial, I didn't can it, just refridgerated after 10 mins of cooking. I also used just normal salt, half of amount of the canning salt. It was so good we chomped it off in no time at all, with corn chips."
329638,9272,2007-07-02,5,"does this recipe really need a 174th review?  Probably not, but I'm adding mine in to the mix.  fresh tomatoes unpeeled, 2 Vidalia onions, 1 jalepeno (the only one I had on hand).  I also omitted the tomato sauce and added in a can of petite diced tomatoes and about 1/2 c chopped cilantro.  I boiled and processed half of the salsa, and stuck the rest into the refrigerator for immediate use.  OMG, the fresher uncooked salsa was AMAZING!  The other was good, but you can't beat that garden fresh taste.  This recipe is a keeper!"
222055,9272,2007-07-27,5,"This is my first time ever canning. I made my own make shift canner. I would make this as fresh salsa also, the taste was WONDERFUL before heated. Due to being short by a couple of tomatoes, I reduced the amount just a little and got 5 pint size jars. I was tickled to death when I heard the 5 pops of the lids. Now I want to do canning as a hobby! Thank you Jazze22!!!"
88099,9272,2007-08-12,5,"Not that you need another review but had to add my 5 starts to this.  I needed some salsa for dinner tonight and didn't have any, so I decided to try this with canned diced tomatoes and a can of rotel, blended in the blender.  I halved the recipe for the two of us and it turned out great.  I simmered this on the stove for about an hour and a half.  I didn't have tomato sauce or tomato paste so used an extra can of tomatoes blended in the blender.  Worked out great.  The spice combination was just right.  thanks"
386849,9272,2007-09-10,2,"I'm sorry, this obviously worked out great for most people but I thought it was just okay. Maybe I'll try it again and omit the sugar, because I thought it was too sweet."
252816,9272,2007-09-24,5,"I didnt want to run to the grocery store so made do with what I had in the house..I used 2/3 cup peperocini peppers and 1/2 cup jalapeno..I used 6 pounds fresh garden tomatoes..I used 2-8oz tomato sauce and cut the sugar to 2 tblsp...We believe this to be the BEST salsa we have ever tasted..The flavor was wonderful,not too tomatoey,or too sweet or too hot...I will be making this recipe from now on..Thank You so much for this recipe.."
579298,9272,2007-10-15,4,"What a GREAT salsa!! I followed the recipe to a T (except I didn't find it necessary to peel the tomatoes) and it was absolutely finger lickin' good! DH and I can't get enough of it! I jarred one bottle, and I froze the remainder (in 2 ziplock containers). Next get together we have I'm whippin' out the homemade salsa :)"
176615,9272,2008-07-06,5,"Had a bunch of fresh tomatoes to use, and am so happy I found this recipe. Loved it! Rather than process the jars, I cooked a little longer, jarred, and stored in the fridge. Will make a batch with cilantro added, too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
173579,9272,2008-08-23,5,This is a great salsa!  Thanks for posting.
353131,9272,2008-09-20,5,"This is by far the best salsa recipe I have ever made and I've made several. I am planning on makeing 2 more batches next week.
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!"
447123,9272,2008-10-10,5,"I think that this is false advertising!!! Wonderful salsa is not the word for it. THE BEST SALSA IN THE WORLD is a better term!!! I had never canned before so I had to read up on it a bit. Really easy to do. Then I went and got my things for this lovely recipe. I boiled my water and dunked my tomatoes for about 30 seconds then shocked them in a cold bat to help get the skins off easily. THis was just too darn easy. The final result was just simply amazing. I will NEVER EVER buy store salsa again. Thank you thank you thank you Jazze22 you are my hero!!!! I would recomend when doign this that you double the recipe because when it is all done you will want to kick yourself for not making more. (like I did) The only thing I added was 1/2cup of cilantro. Also just a squirt of lemon and lime.
One last thing. In the dozens of batches I have made I have never added any sugar. And it still stateds AMAZING!!"
847160,9272,2009-01-07,5,wooow   ...the best salsa ever .. but how long before it goes bad
355637,9272,2009-01-17,5,"Wow, this is awesome salsa! I consider myself a pretty tough critic too, but this is delish!"
64642,9272,2009-07-10,0,"If you BWB can this salsa, these are the current directions for salsa making from the NCHFP:
Wear plastic or rubber gloves and do not touch your face while handling or cutting hot peppers. If you do not wear gloves, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your face or eyes.

Peel and prepare chili peppers.
Wash tomatoes and dip in boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds or until skins split.
Dip in cold water, slip off skins, and remove cores.
Coarsely chop tomatoes and combine chopped peppers, onions, and remaining ingredients in a large saucepan.
Heat to boil, and simmer 10 minutes.
Fill hot, sterilized jars; wipe rims and place lids.
Screw on bands finger tight.
Process pint jars in boiling water bath for 15 minutes up to 1000 feet elevation; 20 minutes at 1001 - 6000 feet elevation; 25 minutes at higher elevations."
844554,9272,2009-09-04,5,"Like this needs another 5 star review but here goes: I cut the recipe in half and used 4 hot house tomatoes,  2 cans of diced tomatoes, a red bell pepper (can't stand the green), regular salt, no sugar and added lime juice from half a lime. I agree that it needs some cilantro so that will go in next time and there will be a next time. I'm gonna put the extra in the freezer since I don't can. Thanks for a great recipe."
532289,9272,2009-09-24,5,"Let me be number 326 to say how ""wonderful"" Wonderful Salsa is.  I ate it ""raw"" before I even started to cook it.  I ate it while it cooked and I am eating it while I am waiting for it to cool.  I can't imagine how good this is going to be once it has a chance to cool and sit for a week or so.  I got 3 quarts and 1 pint jar.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I have been looking for the perfect canned salsa recipe and now I can stop."
1269015,9272,2009-12-06,5,"I made a very small serving of this to go with our quesadillas and guacamole and the family raved about this salsa. I thought it was a bit too sweet, and will probably cut back on the sugar just a little bit in the future (but I also left out the jalapeno). But we're never going to want Pace or any other storebought salsa again!"
126440,9272,2009-12-17,4,I made two pints of this for my first ever salsa.  I canned them this summer and this is the first time using the salsa.  A bit too sweet for me but DH said it was great.  Will try again next summer with more home grown tomatoes.
1072593,9272,2012-06-25,5,"10 Stars!  With 411 winning reviews, we need to start up a Camp Fooddotcom...and have winners and stuff like that.  [To the batch, I added the juice of 1 lime after turning off the fire and before processing.]"
1179225,9272,2013-08-13,5,"Excellent! Doubled the recipe, left the skins on, left out the sugar, halved the cumin, added 2 teaspoons of chili powder, 2 tablespoons of cayenne, 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro. So easy and looks great in the jars. Thanks for sharing this terrific keeper, recipe!"
140132,9272,2013-09-18,5,"This was delicious salsa.  I used the food processor to save time and so the veggies were all evenly cut.  The addition of the tomato sauce and paste made this the best.  We loved it.  I put mine up in pint jars and I got 8 pints.  Thank you for sharing, I&#039;m off to make another batch now!"
111291,9272,2013-09-24,5,"Oh, yum! I have made lots of fresh salsa, but this is the first time I canned salsa. Soooo glad I chose this recipe! It will definitely be my &quot;go to&quot; recipe. No reason to change anything (except the amount of jalepanos/heat); perfectly delish as posted. Thanks so much for sharing."
199020,9272,2014-08-20,5,"Wow! I will never buy commercial salsa again! I used fresh cherry and roma tomatoes, jalapenos, and bell peppers from my garden. The flavor is amazing. This is great with black beans and corn added (although I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s safe to can with them). I only add about half the cumin, and I never peel the tomatoes. Thank you!"
839492,9272,2015-08-11,5,"I intended on canning this and made this before going to the store for both the tomato sauce and paste (and cilantro which I always love in salsa). We however, loved this so much that there wasn&#039;t enough left to even bother jarring. I used lime juice instead of vinegar (personal preference). This was so fresh and delicious, I will make it again as instructed (reducing the sugar by half) and then one more time; making half with mango and half a little hotter. Great way to use up the jalapenos, onions, and tomatoes in the garden. This is such a flavorful and excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
1581225,9272,2017-02-07,5,"Amazing salsa! First time I've made salsa, and I was impressed. I'm glad it makes a lot because it was a lot of work, especially with peeling and chopping all those tomatoes. Better than store bought."
93006,87085,2004-06-19,5,"Hooray, another keeper!  This was a big hit with the family, and so easy to put together.  I used skim milk and egg sub, and also left out the green pepper as the DDs don't care for it.  Also subbed 1 T. onion powder for the onion, as no chunky things are allowed!  Because I assembled this in the morning it was cold when I was ready to bake.  I put it in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes (covered with foil), then uncovered and raised heat to 425 for a few minutes.  This one goes in the permanent recipe file!"
52543,87085,2004-07-29,5,"Awesome was the verdict by my 13 year old grandson - and the rest of us agreed! I followed the recipe exactly (and other than adding mushrooms when the kids aren't around), I'll do so again. Thanx kim!"
68884,87085,2004-11-02,4,"This was a really great weeknight meal -- easy, quick to prepare, & with items I always keep on hand. I made the recipe exactly as-is except added a small can of sliced mushrooms. This was good, but DH & I agreed it just needed a little more spice -- more garlic, more chili powder -- & I think next time I'll add another can of tomato sauce - I didn't have any sauce to sop up with bread!! :)  Thanks so much for sharing!"
160974,87085,2004-12-17,5,"I made this awhile ago and forgot to post my review! First of all, the photo of the dish had me scrambling to get my ingredients together. Secondly, I love recipes that are based on cafeteria food. I think because I love the cozy feeling associated with ""diner"" food. This recipe didn't disappoint me. Besides being easy to assemble, it cut great, family enjoyed it, and I will be making it again, today!

64203,87085,2005-05-10,5,"This was delicious! I was looking for a spaghetti recipe that used ingredients I had on hand and this was it! Cheesey and delicious! Next time, I'll probably increase the cumin and chili powder a bit to give it a little more zing. This recipe was a hit and will probably be one that I make for new mom's :) Thanks for sharing Kim!"
173579,87085,2005-07-20,5,This was the best baked spaghetti recipe that I have ever tried.  It was awesome.  My whole family even loved it also.  That's unusual for that to happen.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  I will be making it many more times.
147109,87085,2005-08-13,5,"This was such a great recipe, and the best part about it was how easy it was to prepare! A definite keeper in my house, thanks so much!!"
176615,87085,2005-08-19,5,"Great family-friendly meal! I made this for ""Freeze-It Tag,"" so froze the unbaked casserole, defrosted, then baked covered at 350 till hot throughout. Uncovered and finished baking at 425. Everyone ate and enjoyed it, so I plan on keeping a few pans in my freezer for busy weeknight meals. Thanks, Kim!"
184723,87085,2005-09-04,5,This was fabulous.  I will add a little less milk next time as it was a bit runny at the bottom but sooooooo good! Thanks!
50969,87085,2005-11-07,4,"this was pretty good,reminded myself and my SO of the spaghetti we used to get at Litton High School. my DS said he liked it too.the next time i make this i'm going to perk it up with just a little more of the spices.thank you for bringing back some memories and for posting."
95743,87085,2006-01-28,5,"Don't think there's much I can add to the previous 46 reviews except my 50-something year old ""kid"" loved this."
56087,87085,2006-09-09,4,"I loved the ease of this recipe.  Will be getting added to my Easy, After work Cookbook.  Great flavor.
Thanks for sharing this winner."
185446,87085,2006-11-30,4,"A nice variation from regular spaghetti.  Thanks, Kim D--your other recipes and cookbooks sound great too."
262312,87085,2007-05-04,5,Speechless!  Wow.  I LOVED this recipe.  I skipped the whole egg and milk thing based on previous reviews.  I used macaroni shaped pasta.  I just combined everything together and topped with 2 additional cups of cheese.  I tripled the spices and it was just right for our tastes.  Will make many more times!!  Thanks for another keeper Kim!!
227607,87085,2007-06-06,5,This was very easy and very good.  I will make often.  I did not use the whole amount of cumin since it is not a favorite around here.  Made for ZWT 07.
125640,87085,2007-08-06,4,"Have made this exactly as directed and also made it subbing elk for the beef; very tasty both ways. Will try adding mushrooms next time (I meant to this time, but my mushrooms looked well past their prime when I grabbed the carton out of the fridge). Thanks for sharing."
74652,87085,2007-08-12,4,They used to make it at the cafeteria where I went to school.  Minus the green pepper (i hate it) this was one of my favorite things on the menu.  I would always buy lunch when they had this.  thanks for sharing!
137911,87085,2007-08-16,5,"This is sooooo delicious!  I loved it and so did my dh and daughter.  I was out of tomato sauce so I used 1 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes and about 3 tablespoons of tomato paste, blended them in the blender and used that.  Turned out fine.  I did bake mine longer at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Thanks for this new repeat recipe!  Pam"
240552,87085,2007-08-20,5,"Super yummy and easy!  I used twice as much cheese and divided into two pans - one for freezer and one for tonight.  I didn't put as much green pepper in because the kids and dh don't like it.  I used 1/4 tsp garlic powder as I was out of regular garlic.  Thanks, Kim!!"
140132,87085,2007-08-23,5,"Mmmmmmm, very good.  We really enjoyed this dish.  The flavors worked well together and who doesn't love pasta???   I have made this twice now and we loved it both times.....I will be making this often.  Thank you.......STephanie"
58836,87085,2007-08-24,5,"Looking for something simple and easy and with the stuff I would have on hand.  This fit the bill. It went together quick and was rather tasty.  I think next time I will double the spices, I just think it needed a bit more.  All in all it was a good supper.  Our guests enjoyed it also.  PS-I added a can of mushrooms."
92886,87085,2007-09-16,4,"Both my husband and I enjoyed this.  I mixed everything together, rather than doing it in layers , poured it into a baking dish and then topped off with the cheese.  I think I would like to add another 8 ozs of tomato sauce and I would up the salt to 1 teaspoon.  I made an extra one to take to my sister and I bet the kids will love it."
248023,87085,2007-09-24,4,"Yum!!!  My BF wanted spaghetti for dinner but I was tired of the same old thing... when I read the description, I knew I just had to try this one!  I also loved the spaghetti they served when I was in elementary school (many moons ago!)  I did scale it down to 3 servings, since it was only the 2 of us... but now I wish I had made the full recipe.  I really loved it and my BF ate it happily, but said he would rather he spaghetti and meatballs...  He is not one for change!!!  I made it just as written (except for the fact that I cut it in half) and I thought it was perfect.  Not too saucy, not dry at all and just the right amount of seasonings... Just delicious, easy to throw together and takes only 10 minutes to bake since all the ingredients are hot to begin with.  I served it with Recipe #18914 I had stashed away in the fridge since I could bake both at basically the same temperature for the same time.  Thanks for a keeper from my childhood!!!"
394077,87085,2007-09-26,4,Very easy to do and a good change of pace.
173314,87085,2007-10-31,5,Really enjoyed this very much! I will increase the sauce mixture next time.  Left out onion and bell pepper as my family's preference.  Thanks!
180090,87085,2007-12-07,5,"Wow, this turned out so good! So quick and easy to make too! I followed everything except used mozzarella instead of monterey jack. The flavors of this are wonderful and the presentation is gorgeous! Thanks for posting a keeper!"
359220,87085,2007-12-19,5,"I'm so glad I finally got around to trying this casserole!  I made it according to directions except I forgot to pick up a bell pepper, so I omitted and used Penzey's Bold Taco seasoning instead of the individual spices.  I did accidently pick up spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, so it did taste a bit more like regular spaghetti, but still tasty and easy enough to warrant many many more tries!  Can't wait to have again!"
229524,87085,2008-01-06,5,"So glad we tried this recipe :)  It is so good, tasty and simple.  Sure can't go wrong making this.  Thanks Kim for sharing :)"
377581,87085,2008-01-13,4,"This is very good. Really flavorful and meaty. I added a can of sliced mushrooms and used whole-wheat pasta. This was a big hit with the family, and easy to put together. I would definitely make it again! Thank you!"
158086,87085,2008-02-18,5,Great recipe...I doubled and added some fiesta corn to it....we really liked it.
286851,87085,2008-02-25,3,"After so many wonderful reviews, I was hoping my family and I would like this baked spaghetti more than we did. It was simple and easy to put together, and I liked that it used common ingredients. I made it exactly as directed. We just didn't find the resulting flavors something we cared for- it was like a taco type casserole with spaghetti--I guess my tastebuds wanted it to go one way or the other. It was not anything specific that was wrong or needed to be changed. It had very mild flavors and is not a bad recipe, nothing wrong per se, just not to our tastes. Thank you for sharing though."
47907,87085,2008-04-03,5,We really enjoyed this for dinner last night.  It was very easy to put together ~ I use less than 1 lb. of meat and I used taco cheese instead of the jack and cheddar but otherwise made as posted.  Quick to bake is a big plus.  Thanks for posting a keeper!
121185,87085,2008-04-23,5,"Totally grade school comfort food.  All three kids loved this (3,6 & 15) as well as hubby - this was really easy to toss together too.  I used a mix of jarred past sauce and pizza sauce for the tom. sauce - I also forgot to add the milk/egg in - so after it had been in the oven for a few minuted, I realized I forgot it - pulled it from the oven, poured it in around the sides and it still baked up great.  Hubby and teen both commented that it needed more pasta though..."
439797,87085,2008-06-12,5,"Yum.  Had all the ingredients handy and was very easy to make.  Froze it after cooking and it reheated very well.  I think we probably prefer spaghetti pie with riccotta cheese, but this was a nice and simple alternative."
145352,87085,2009-06-18,5,I really liked this!!! The only thing I did different was use a bit more spaghetti to make it stretch.
135887,87085,2009-07-08,4,Delicious and easy to throw together.  I think I will add a little more seasonings next time but overall very yummy!
199792,87085,2009-07-29,5,"I love baked spaghetti and we really enjoyed this one. I did find it needed a bit more salt at the table but I may have been a little light in prep. I didn't have tomato sauce so used a can of diced tomatoes instead. I think the sauce would have been much better with the sauce but I didn't take a star off for taste as it was my fault not the recipes. I did add fresh mushrooms and they were a nice addition. I love how the spaghetti set up, so yummy. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
426903,87085,2009-10-21,4,Very good hearty meal. THe recipe was simple enough that my husband was able to follow it. I think next time we will mix the meat sauce with the noodles so that it is evenly dispersed. Other then that...pretty tasty!
1122161,87085,2009-11-04,5,"This was really cheap, fast, easy, simple, and tasty! The seasonings were spot on too! Thanks for posting this, we enjoyed it! :)"
485151,87085,2009-11-18,3,"This was ok for my family. We all liked it ok, but probably won't make it again."
264017,87085,2010-01-12,4,"My son liked this a whole lot more than I did, so I upped the review to 4 stars. Usually he doesn't like leftovers, but he asked if he could have the last serving to take in his lunchbox! If making this again, I'd add a small can of tomato sauce to add a saucier texture. I used half ground turkey breast with the ground beef to keep it healthier. We'll try this one again. Thanks Kim D.!"
879716,87085,2010-02-12,5,"Dh and I really like this twist on spaghetti.  The only changes I made were to make it a little healthier (whole wheat pasta and reduced fat cheese, milk, and beef).  The egg and milk mixture added a creaminess to the noodles that I really liked.  I considered stirring the meat mixture into the noodles but put it on top as you directed instead - I think that definitely kept the noodles from getting dry.  Next time I'll add some jalapenos for a bit of spice.  Thanks for sharing!"
1269015,87085,2010-06-11,5,"I made this vegan by subbing the egg with ground flax seed and the meat with corn, black beans, tomatoes and green chilis. The dish was pretty spicy -- probably not a good idea to include both the chilis and chili powder -- and so we garnished with sour cream and fresh cilantro to help take out some of the bite. I may have to use rice next time instead of the spaghetti as well, as several of my family members thought the 'southwestern spaghetti' sounded ""weird"" and wouldn't go near it. Psh. *I* loved it."
407007,87085,2010-06-24,5,"Good stuff! I used whole wheat spaghetti and omitted the onion, minced garlic and bell pepper so the sauce wouldn't be chunky. I did use some onion and garlic powder for that flavor though. DH and I both loved the flavor of the sauce, and thought it might be fun to try this dish as a lasagna with some ricotta mixed in. We just might do that! Thanks for sharing it!"
456858,87085,2011-09-26,3,"Well, my first thought after making was, Oh, chili with spaghetti. I guess I don't know what I expected after reading the ingredients and directions.  It reminded me of a dish I heard about years ago: Cincinnati-style chilli is usually served as a topping over a bowl of spaghetti. I know the recipe is SOUTHWESTERN Baked spaghetti, but I didn't think of Cincinnati as southwestern. It tasted good, but I don't quite know if I would make again?  Hey, you never know what company might request :-)"
191533,87085,2012-01-23,5,"My husband really liked this meal; I halved the recipe for the two of us and it fed us for two meals, so it makes a lot. I used just the egg white when halving the recipe."
126440,87085,2013-01-10,5,Excellent recipe!  Loved how quick and easy it was.  Made half a recipe and still have enough for another night.  Used Anaheim pepper for the green.
2549237,87085,2013-01-17,4,"The meat mixture had a great flavor, I found that the flavor didn't go down into the  noodles at all and they were bland.  Next time I will double the meat/sauce mixture and mix half into the noodles.  Also, we love cheese, so I used a whole 12 oz bag on Monterey Jack cheese and 1 cup of Cheddar."
285039,87085,2014-02-26,4,"Easy and tasty recipe.  Next time I would decrease the amount of pasta, and perhaps replace it with beans.  I topped with cilantro and homemade guacamole."
368078,87085,2014-04-29,4,"Made just as directed.  I thought it needed a little more salt, but other than that was very good.  We didn&#039;t have the problem with the sauce staying on top...ours mixed in nicely with the spaghetti (we did use a 9x13 pan though...I don&#039;t know if it would have gone into the spaghetti if is was much deeper)."
37779,87085,2014-08-09,5,"We loved this casserole. Easy to assemble, delicious flavor. Perfect weeknight meal. Thanks."
93006,81211,2004-01-21,5,"No lie, wonderful flavor and easy to make!  We loved it.  Funny, my bread-machine cookbook had a whole list of ingredients, and this wonderful bread basically had just 3!  Go with this recipe, for sure!"
64934,81211,2004-02-10,5,"It's hard to believe that this bread which only has four ingredients, tastes so good!!  The loaves were golden brown and crusty when I took them from the oven!   This recipe was so easy, and tasted wonderful!  I will be making this regularly.  Thanks Marie!"
222433,81211,2009-03-20,5,My family loves this dipped in balsamic and olive oil. They request it often.
59780,81211,2004-02-20,5,"I used Canadian all purpose flour which I am told is equivilant to bread flour in the States.  If it did matter, I still found  this recipe to be a winner. Followed the directions exactly with perfect results. I usually run out to the store to buy french bread when I make baked french onion soup, now I can make it at home--thanks!"
64203,81211,2004-04-13,5,"Like other reviewers, I thought for sure this recipe wouldn't be as great as the reviews, only because it had so few ingredients. Boy, was I ever wrong! What a great tasting bread! Easy to make, quick to prepare and so tasty!
Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
13796,81211,2004-11-20,5,"Yes.. I too must add my 5-star review. The loaves turned out beautifully golden brown. They looked like professional loaves. The taste was good, too. So easy to make that there is no reason to run to the store for a fresh baguette when you can whip this up in no time at all. Great recipe. I'm making another batch as I type this. The first loaf went to mom and dad and they loved it. I'm working on the second loaf right now. It's good toasted, too!"
173314,81211,2004-11-26,5,Thanks for the wonderfully easy and tasty recipe...I will never have to buy the pillsbury french bread again when I can whip this up!
176615,81211,2004-11-30,5,"This is good stuff, tender on the inside with a good texture, and crispy on the outside. Also, much more convenient that running to the store for a loaf of inferior bread. One loaf was plenty for us for dinner (including my late night bread and butter snack). I'll probably make garlic bread with the other and throw it in the freezer. Thanks for the super recipe!"
95743,81211,2005-01-22,5,"I'm delighted to have found this recipe.  I used, 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour.  The recipe doesn't say to and I suppose most know that it should be done, BUT before putting the loaves in the oven, slash them diagonally every 2 1/2""  with a sharp knife or razor blade.  Every 5 minutes spray the loaves and the inside of the oven with water in order to crisp them up.  I don't have a bread machine so I mixed the dough and ""kneaded"" it in the food processor with the dough blade, then let it rest, covered in an oiled bowl for 1 hour. Continue as directed from step 3 and on.  Makes a great, healthy loaf of bread."
88099,81211,2005-06-26,5,"This is fantastic.  There were some technician errors on my part, but I know how to correct them.  I love the crust on this bread.  Won't be buying french bread at the store anymore.  Thanks Marie for another great recipe.  Your recipes seem to have been on my table all weekend."
185285,81211,2005-06-27,5,"Thank You.  I've been learning to work with sourdough and really needed a confidence booster.  This is failproof.  DH accidentally smooshed my 1st rise, so I had to re-shape and let rise again.  It still turned out great.  I also used 1/2 Whole Wheat Flour.  Thanks fora  fantastic recipe.   Note for French-Bread Newbies:  The crust will be really hard. Tapping on it, it will almost sound hollow.  I waited until my crust was med-brown before pulling it out and the middle was baked to perfection with a crunchy crust."
29782,81211,2005-07-04,5,The name really fits this recipe! Its absolutely fantastic! I made this for our weekend at the lake and it went over great. We all enjoyed the two loafs I got out of this recipe. Thinking I may try making  rolls with half next time. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
394077,81211,2007-06-22,5,"I made these for garlic bread and this recipe is very easy to make and tastes great.  Keeper. The next time,  instead of 2 loaves,  I will make one ."
145352,81211,2007-08-13,5,This is the same recipe I've been using for years! LOVE IT!!!
402559,81211,2007-11-26,5,"I've made three loaves this last week and each one came out perfect. For 2 loaves I stuffed the dough with jalapeÃ±os, sausage and cheese for the other I used cheese and caramelized onions. They were both great but I already have more requests for the JalapeÃ±o loaf! Thanks, will be making often."
199792,81211,2008-09-14,5,I love delicious and easy in the same package and this really fills the bill! I did have one little problem (actually not so little) -- my bread machine was working away while I was busy doing something else. I heard a mighty crash and there was the BM on the floor. Thankfully my dough stayed in the machine and didn't seem to suffer any bad consequence. Surprisingly the machine still worked and finished the job. I don't think it will work to bake though because the lid no longer closes properly!! Now that is more information than you need but wanted to share my little story. I will make this many more times. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe. This was made for I Recommend Tag.
80998,81211,2008-09-29,5,This certainly was failproof.  It was enjoyed ball all with dinner.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks.
383346,81211,2008-10-14,4,This bread is great with just a few ingredients.  But a little something is missing but can't find it.  Maybe a little bit of sugar.  Thanks Marie.  Made for I recommend tag
632249,81211,2008-12-12,5,Just upping my rating to 5*.  I made this again today and the loaves turned out great.  I think I am learning how to shape a loaf - at last!  Nov 12/08 Excellent flavour but my loaves looked kind of flat and spread out. I will definitely make this again and play around with the shape to see if I can do better next time.  Definitely a simple recipe so thanks!
50969,81211,2009-01-14,5,"I was looking for a very easy french bread recipe and came across this one and decided to try it. And I'm so glad I did :) Since I didn't need two loaves of bread, the recipe was cut in half.And instead of making a loaf,the dough was divided into four pieces and rolls were formed.They rose perfect in the amount of time stated in the recipe.The taste was just what you would expect from french bread, crusty on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Thank you so much for posting a wonderful recipe. This will be made again, and ""Keep Smiling :)"""
172369,81211,2010-01-25,5,"This was perfect, made for my vegan friends. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
400708,81211,2012-04-07,5,"Well here's review 114 and with good reason, this is such a simple, fast and wonder tasting recipe.  I'd saved it a long time ago but never got around to making it.  Yesterday needed something fast to go with dinner and pulled this out of my saved recipes.  Well; it won't take me that long to make it again - this is wonderful.  Perfect blend of flavors for that french bread flavor with a light, soft center and that wonderful crunchy crust.  When I put the loaves in the oven I did spray lightly with water every 5 minutes X3 to help with the crust I was wanting and it turned out perfect.  I was surprised it had no oil in it and was a little concerned but no need - it's perfect as is."
140132,81211,2013-10-19,5,"This was perfect with our soup the other night.  I made the two loaves thinking I could save some for another time, but nope.  We ate them both.  Thank you for this great recipe."
937635,81211,2014-03-11,5,"Great recipe. I didn&#039;t realize I should cut them before rising, so I cut after but it didn&#039;t have the right effect. Regardless it was delicious with chicken and noodles. I&#039;m using the second loaf for blueberry bread pudding. Thanks!"
126440,81211,2014-10-03,5,Turned out great.  Loved the flavor with a little butter and zucchini lasagna an chopped Italian salad.
847160,114392,2008-05-31,5,wow ..... the best pizza sauce ....match perfect with my 3 cheese pizza
52543,116849,2005-04-17,5,"No raw eggs, no oil, awesome taste! I don't have a mini food processor - so I chopped the anchovies very fine with a sharp knife & used my press for the garlic, then added to my regular food processor after all of the other ingredients; it worked well. I couldn't get Hellman's Dijonnaise at my local market - so I used Miracle Whip's new Mustard Mania which is probably a comparable product. Although I made the dressing early in the day to allow the flavours to blend, I didn't need to thin with buttermilk as it was the perfect consistency. Thanx Kitten!"
53932,116849,2005-04-23,5,"This is really good!  As the flavors do get stronger over time, you might want to make half a batch for a small family.  However, it tastes so good that it probably won't sit around long.  Thanks for sharing!"
136997,116849,2005-08-01,5,WOW! This was awesome! I did cut back on the garlic as my cloves were very big. This is sooo much better than  bottled. :)
176615,116849,2005-11-21,5,"Excellent! I love Caesar dressing but will no longer make the traditional recipe with raw egg, so this recipe is a real find. Easy to put together and has just the right balance of flavors in a creamy and delicious dressing. I tossed with romaine, fresh parmesan and homemade garlic croutons for a real treat. Like all dressings, this should be made in advance so the flavors have a chance to meld. Thanks, Kittencal, for a great recipe!"
278113,116849,2006-07-18,5,"Just amazing! This is the best Caeser dressing I have ever eaten, and I am delighted that I can make it anytime we want it!! I never wanted to mess around wtih the raw egg dressings, so when I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it. I used the anchovy paste (much easier and then I do not have to look at or touch those buggers! LOL) THANKYOU so much for sharing this dressing recipe..we will use this often!"
8688,116849,2006-07-26,5,"Kittencal, I don't know how you do it!  This is one sensational Caesar Salad dressing!!  This recipe is so simple to put together, with ingredients that are normally in my cabinet! So why have I been buying mediocre Caesar salad dressing from the grocery store, when I can make a  Superior Caesar Salad Dressing right in my own kitchen? When Kittencal makes a statement that a recipe is ""Delicious"" you  better pay attention, or you will miss out on something quite extraordinary!  Thanks again and again, Kittencal, for sharing all your fabulous recipes!!"
177933,116849,2006-10-12,5,"The BEST caesar dressing I have ever made.  I've tied several and never have found one that is perfect, until now.  Tangy and with a little kick, it's perfect.  Thanks, I made it exactly as written. "
91392,116849,2006-11-01,4,"Good, but not the same as Caesar salad dressing made traditionally.  This is probably better for you and a bit lighter.  I didn't think it had quite enough taste and would up the anchovies and garlic next time.  Very creamy, easy for anyone to like."
199792,116849,2007-02-11,5,Very good salad and dressing. I didn't have any anchovy fillets on hand so left them out and it was still good. I did fry about 8 slices of bacon until crisp and broke it into the salad along with home made croutons. I was only sorry that I hadn't made more. We all really enjoyed it with our lasagna.
51011,116849,2007-02-28,5,"My dh has been wanting caesar salad, but I knew that instead of buying a bottled dressing, I could instead make it from scratch.  This was very good!  Only change I made was to use 1 tbs of lemon juice (we really do not care much for lemon).  The dressing did need to be thinned out a bit, but that was an easy fix :).  Thanks for sharing!"
189616,116849,2007-04-27,5,"OMG EXCELLANT! The only thing I would change next time is not adding salt since I did add 2 anchovies, so this was a bit salty for our tastes.
Thanks for another winner!"
142367,116849,2007-07-05,5,"OOPS!  I can't believe that I forgot to rate this recipe -- sorry Kittencal.  This dressing is so yummy, I am starting to drool thinking about it.  I make this in the blender and use anchovy paste.    I have also used milk instead of cream. It can't get much easier than this -- or yummier.  Thanks for the recipe."
248023,116849,2007-09-18,5,"I cannot believe I have not reviewed this yet...  ooops... I wanted a grilled chicken caesar salad for dinner and ALWAYS use this dressing.  No other dressing even comes close... restaurant or bottled!  My BF claims he ""hates"" anchovies but does not complain one bit as he devours his salad and then proceeds to lick any remaining dressing stuck to the bowl!!!  I use 2-3 anchovy fillets, 2-3 large garlic cloves, 2% organic milk, freshly grated parmesan, fresh lemon juice ( as if there were any other!!!) stone ground mustard, and organic worcestershire.  I do thin it out with a bit of milk because it is quick thick... but soooooooooo delicious.  It does get stronger as it sits in the fridge, but it usually does not last more than 2 days around here!!!  Thanks for a keeper for life!!!"
347822,116849,2007-11-24,5,"Awesome recipe!!! I followed the recipe to a T, including the anchovy fillets and garlic cloves.  I minced both ingredients with a wide knife to a paste like texture.  Thank you loads for a great posting."
333017,116849,2007-12-01,5,"Perfect....didn't change a thing.  I will be using this recipe again and again.  Wonderful contribution, Kittencal!!!"
312577,116849,2007-12-26,5,You should bottle this amazingly good dressing!  I followed the recipe to the letter and was rewarded with a wonderful salad.  I made a double batch for more caesar salads.  I served this for Christmas dinner.  Thank you for making me look like a professional cook once again!
173579,116849,2008-01-03,5,This was a very tasty caesar salad.  Really quick to make.  Thanks for posting.
285039,116849,2008-01-03,5,"My favorite caesar dressing to date!  Definite keeper, another Kittencal recipe that goes in a permanent cookbook for this chef!  Thanks!"
160974,116849,2008-01-07,5,"Hi Kitten! We sure enjoyed your easy Caesar dressing in you tortellini Caesar salad. I used ff half and half. Thanks so much.

Roxygirl"
125640,116849,2008-02-02,5,Great flavor. Easy to make. Thanks for sharing. We'll have this one often.
55578,116849,2008-02-25,5,"A great caesar salad Kitten!  I used anchovy paste, low fat Hellman's, and f.f. half and half cream.  The family loved it."
37036,116849,2008-03-24,5,"I order Caesar Salads all the time when I go out to a restaurant, but I've never tried making the dressing at home.  I had to leave out the anchovies because my husband is alleric to seafood.  However, I felt the dressing still had a wonderful flavor even with that change.  Thank you Kittencal for another great recipe!"
95743,116849,2008-05-13,5,I made recipe #166669 for Mother's Day and used the dressing from this recipe.  It was marvelous and raved about by my entire family of in-laws.  the cherry on top was recipe #125034.  Make this.  You'll love it.
497077,116849,2008-05-27,5,"This is wonderful-a DH favorite! I follow your measurements because I'm not good at ""to taste"" and really don't see a need to change a thing. I do use Hellmans, skim milk, and Grey Poupon Country Dijon. (Have never had to thin.)Thank you so much for a great recipe!!!"
93006,116849,2008-06-26,5,Perfection!  The dressing was enough for two batches of salad and is garlicy delicious (I used the anchovies and no one ever knew!).  Add Kitten's homemade crouton's and this salad is a huge hit!
489552,116849,2008-08-31,5,"Loved loved this dressing Kittencal.  This is a keeper!  My oldest daughter couldn't beleive I made it from scratch.  I told her thanks to you, it was possible.
Thank you."
461834,116849,2008-09-20,5,"Wonderful Caesar Salad!!!  I was worried about the dijon mustard being over powering, as it isn't one of my favorites, but it was just right.  I even got my picky 20 yo DD to try and she liked it also.  I used anchovy paste, otherwise followed as written.  Thanks Kittencal for another great recipe.  Made for zaar star tag."
318235,116849,2008-10-02,5,"Served this with spaghetti and garlic bread and everyone loved it. So easy, I will definitely make this again over buying dressing. Thanks Kitten!"
54678,116849,2008-10-19,5,I was visiting chef Chill in TN and she made this salad for my family on our last night of vacation and this was an awesome salad. I will def do again when I'm back at home in Thunder Bay.
74281,116849,2008-12-21,5,"WOW is the word that came to mind with the first bite of this delicious salad. The dressing is rich and garlicky and although I was a bit afraid of the anchovy, it was a nice addition. I did add the optional Worcestershire sauce which to me was just the right touch. I served this with Recipe #80536 and we had a very elegant and tasty meal combination. This is also so easy I will never buy bottled Caesar dressing again."
140132,116849,2009-03-02,5,"I love caesar salads and have always shyed away from making them at home.  No more, this is so easy and tastes great.  Its fast, easy and tastes just like the restaraunts.  I used anchovy paste instead of the fillets, other then that I followed to a T.  Thank you for posting."
879716,116849,2012-10-12,5,Seriously yummy dressing!
1072593,116849,2009-05-13,5,"Hail Caesar, for he's a man that knows his salad dressings!  Made for Healthy Choices ABC Tag '09."
579298,116849,2009-10-25,4,Awesome!! But I like your Recipe #66596 just a BIT more :) Thanks for posting!!
768828,116849,2009-12-15,5,"Kittencal when I made your Garlic Croutons, I saw the recipe for Caesar Salad and just had to make it.  I am so glad I did.  I left out the anchovies and was still excellent.  One of these days I will get brave and try it with anchovies.  Thanks for another awesome recipe.  People out there, you cannot go wrong with a Kittencal recipe."
1506604,116849,2010-08-06,0,"Really good, if you add alot of fresh grounded pepper it tastes just like Red Lobster's Ceasar Dressing. Although the instructions leave room for you to add 'to taste' but please know that you can be free with everything except the anchovies. I threw in a whole can because they were stuck together and because they were sliced so I didn't know the equivalent of two anchovies. I spent so long increasing the other ingredients to balance the taste, but eventually I did it. So it's just a warning but it came out wonderful. I used light cream for the thinning. Now I am just wondering how long it can survive in the fridge before going bad?"
937635,116849,2010-09-01,5,"This was a great ceasar salad dressing! I skipped the anchovies because I was too lazy to go to the market to buy them, but I could tell they were missing so next time, they're going in (and I won't tell my husband, lol!). We didn't need to thin it down and tossed the dressing with the lettuce and a perfect tomato from the garden. Thanks for the keeper, Kittencal!"
76951,116849,2010-09-23,5,"Great Caesar salad dressing.  I used anchovy paste and FF milk, then thinned with buttermilk.  There's nothing like homemade salad dressing!"
187281,116849,2010-10-22,5,Thank you Kittencal! This is truly amazing! I'm having a dinner party tomorrow night and I couldn't be more excited to serve this caesar salad.  Highly recommended!
482376,116849,2011-05-03,5,WOW. This is going straight into my best of the best file. I loved the dressing!!! It was perfect with the romaine and croutons. I did use anchovy paste instead of anchovy filets. I ended up using about 1 t. of the paste. I didn't think the dressing needed any more salt. It was perfect. Thank you!
264017,116849,2011-12-25,5,"Another great recipe, Kitten! No anchovies for us and I since I don't have a food processor (gasp!), I used a bowl and whisk with not problem. Even with just one hour resting time, the taste was superb. I used Low-Fat Hellmans, too."
198154,116849,2016-01-30,4,"I made this using the milk option, anchovy paste instead of fillets, added the optional Worcestershire sauce.  I didn&#039;t thin it at all. If it was just for me, I would have thinned it a little, but my family liked it just as it was. This is quick and easy to put together. Thanks!"
368078,101104,2009-11-22,5,This is our favorite!  It's what we make every year.  Thanks for posting :)
91392,73825,2004-07-21,5,"I made a couple of changes to lower the fat, like applesauce for the oil, all egg whites, no nuts, cut the sugar down to a cup...this was fast to put together, easy, and gave a fantastic result!  I love the cinnamon taste in there. My center didn't fall, it gave a beautifully flat cake.  This is much easier than the last carrot cake I made, and I love the pineapple in there.  A super-winner with my picky French husband!! "
64642,73825,2005-09-30,5,"A lovely, moist, delicious cake that could only be made better by the addition of chopped pecans (I was out of nuts).  We'll be making this one again."
92886,73825,2005-12-23,5,"Great carrot cake!  I didn't think I would like the pineapple, but I really enjoyed it along with the addition of the coconut.  I used two round 9 inch pans.    Making it as a layer cake required more icing. "
37305,73825,2006-01-10,5,"This is great carrot cake.  I had a recipe like this from Taste of Home magazine (maybe the same?), and we LOVED it.  We moved recently and I'm not sure where that magazine is, so I went searching here on 'zaar looking for something close.  Well, this definitely filled the bill!  Everything in here works so great together, and it came out so moist and delicious.  Great the first day, but stupendous the next, after being in the fridge overnight.  Thanks so much for posting this!"
222055,73825,2006-04-17,5,"This cake is definetly 5 star carrot cake, though I am not sure if you really need the coconut. I couldn't tell that it was even in there so next time I am going to omit it to see if there is any difference. I also want to try another icing. I made cupcakes with this recipe and as I very well should have expected (duh), the cupcakes stay flat on top. It took them about 30 minutes to cook. They are delicious!  Thank you Lennie!"
386849,73825,2007-02-06,5,"This was great!  My Mom made it for my B-day and even my Hubby, who hates carrot cake, loved it!  She did switch out the oil for applesauce and omitted the coconut.
Thanks so much for posting!"
47907,73825,2007-03-17,4,I've had this recipe in my cookbook forever so I decided now was the time to make it :)  It was very easy to put together and the flavor is great.  I made it in a 9x13 pan.  I made the frosting as well and it complements the cake very nicely.  I did omit the coconut because of personal preference but otherwise made as posted.  Thanks for posting this!
229524,73825,2007-04-08,5,Great recipe.  Love the flavor.  It just seems to taste better with evey bite.  Thanks Lennie :)
312577,73825,2007-10-22,5,"This recipe makes a very moist cake.  I made cupcakes from this recipe.  They were easy to make because I used already shredded carrots.  I think this is a 5 star Recipezaar recipe!!  Thanks Lennie for posting this wonderful, yet easy recipe."
158086,73825,2007-11-26,5,Very good carrot cake we really enjoyed it.
389431,73825,2008-03-14,5,This was too yummy! I love carrot cake and this was one of the best I've had! Thanks so much!
353131,73825,2008-03-20,5,Made this for the customers today! I made in three layers and got 17 servings out of it!! One of my customers emailed and asked me to bring her another piece tomorrow when I bring their dinners! My catering business is going great because of recipes like this!!
394077,73825,2008-05-12,4,"My DH loves this cake.  To me, it is good in flavor but the crumb is a bit dry. The next time, I will reduce the baking time by 5 minutes to  see if that will help.  Thanks."
93006,73825,2008-06-27,5,"Love the addition of the pineapple and coconut - adds alot of texture and flavor.  Excellent cake, but used my own frosting recipe."
173579,73825,2008-10-13,5,Nice tasting cake.  It was very simple to put together.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
810787,73825,2008-10-20,5,Holy cow this was good. I actually used Spenda to cut back on the sugar and no one noticed at my Dad's b-day party. Super texture. Loved every bite!
32058,73825,2009-01-10,5,"WOW!  This was great.  I forgot to addthe coconut (will next time) but it came out perfec t.  i made this in 2 8"" pans and frosted with 2x the frosting.  Nexttime I will use 1 1/2 the recipe.  PERFECTO!  No need to search for a better cake.  My grandmother made the best carrot cake, this has replaced that one. try it, you will NOT be disappointed!"
140132,73825,2009-03-06,5,"5 +++++ stars!  This is absolutely fabulous!  I printed this recipe out a couple of years ago and never got around to making it.  OMG, I was such a fool.  This is by far the best cake I have ever made.  It is rich and so moist and I love the addition of pineapple and coconut.  My family went nuts over this cake, I'm so glad I finally got around to trying it, cuz it will definately be repeated.....over and over and over....lol.  Thank you so much for posting."
333017,73825,2009-03-22,5,"Outstanding!  Incredible!  Top drawer!  A perfect 10!  My DD wanted a carrot cake for her birthday, so this was the perfect opportunity to try this recipe.   I took the advice of Kasha and used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup of Grapeseed oil.  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and with using sweetened coconut, that was plenty sweet enough!!!  I baked it in 2 8"" round cake pans for 35 minutes.  I used Kittencals Pan Release, Professional Pan Coating Recipe, #78579.   For the frosting, I used 6T butter and added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I had plenty enough frosting to cover the whole cake.  MY DD used to like the carrot cakes from Safeway, but has changed her mind and this became her all time favorite and my DH said the frosting was ""to die for"", and not overly sweet.  I think I will keep this one!  Thanks Lennie!"
252816,73825,2009-09-03,4,"I made this to take to a potluck..It was good,and my DH says he likes it because its a heavy cake..."
1179225,73825,2009-09-14,5,Loved this cake! We thought it was better the next day. Can't really add anything that hasn't already been said. Thank you for this great and easy recipe.
329638,73825,2010-02-05,5,"Does this recipe REALLY need a 300th review?  YES!  It's THAT good!
I've had this in my cookbook  forever, and why I'm just now getting around to it, I don't know.  But I'm sooo glad I did, this is incredible!  I did cut the oil with applesauce (3/4 c applesauce, 1/4 oil), used only one cup of sugar, and some frozen sliced carrots that someone had given us.  I tossed those int he food processor and added them in.  The pineapple didn't get drained, thanks to my overeager little helpers,s o the cake was 'slightly' tough (could be from their enthusiastic stirring too!).  I baked this in 2 9"" rounds, stacked with a layer of icing int he middle, and we ooh'd, ahh'd and moaned in ecstacy through the whole thing. There wasn't a crumb left..and they all want to have another this weekend!  Thanks so much for posting this jewel!"
1052873,73825,2010-04-04,5,"Great cake! I'm sure it would have been even better with coconut and walnuts, but then no one but me would have eaten it. I did put in raisins. I had to cook it about 10 minutes more, but I think the pineapple wasn't drained enough."
131021,73825,2010-05-17,5,I thought this was really good. My family wasn't so enthusiastic but I don't think it was this carrot cake just carrot cake in general. I added a bit of vanilla extract to the frosting and I loved that it was such a cream cheesy frosting. YUM.
103876,73825,2011-07-04,5,My 14 year old daughter made this cake yesterday all by herself.  It turned out great and was loved by all.  It is very moist and flavorful and baked up perfectly.  Thanks for posting!
189616,73825,2011-10-13,5,Awesome!!!
177933,73825,2012-10-27,5,So easy and SO delicious! Thank you... loved the icing too!
377039,73825,2013-02-17,4,"This was quite good. It wasn't like most carrot cakes I've had before, but it tasted good and got even better after sitting for a day.  I loved the icing but my husband said that was where he thought it was lacking.  Next time, I'll sub a cup of brown sugar instead of 1 3/4 cup white sugar, and skip the coconut, and maybe add raisins. I thought the coconut made it very chewy and didn't add to the overall flavor. I'll also add some extra spice; nutmeg and clove, perhaps, as other reviewers have suggested."
2549237,73825,2013-03-31,3,"I don&#039;t know why, but I followed the directions to a T and ours came out with a metallic taste.  I baked it in a glass 9x13 baking dish, so I know it wasn&#039;t a taste from the pan.  Also all of my ingredients were new, so it wasn&#039;t because of old products.  I had such high hopes for this cake, but it just didn&#039;t fill the bill.  I hope others continue to have better luck than I did with this cake."
240552,73825,2014-03-20,5,"Got rave reviews!  I used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 natural applesauce for the oil; unsweetened coconut; and in the frosting - 4 oz cream cheese with the 4 oz butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/3 cup maple syrup"
1581225,73825,2016-11-08,5,A great carrot cake recipe! Home made is always best!
52125,114392,2006-05-05,5,"Oh my gosh what can I say about this recipe, except your title says it all, ULTIMATE PIZZA SAUCE! This is the best pizza sauce I've ever tasted, way better then even pizza places. I was kinda worried about how the celery would taste in it, but it turned out perfect! This will go into my most loved recipe collection! Thanks for the keeper SAMS_Club...."
227607,114392,2006-06-17,5,Wonderful sauce...I did not use the fennel seeds because I did not have them.  I added extra garlic and used tomato puree for some of the tomato paste.  Still turned out great.  Used on pizza dough Recipe #172304  which was great too.
59780,114392,2006-09-19,5,"The only change I made was to whirl the veggies and the fennel in the blender with the tomato sauce to hide them from the kids! This was a great sauce and it was enjoyed by all, thanks!"
358796,114392,2007-06-07,5,Left out the fennel and added crushed red pepper flakes instead. Fabulous thick pizza sauce!
470351,114392,2008-03-29,5,Magnificent!!!!  SUPER flavorful!!  Truly authentic tasting!!!  I followed the direction to a T (other than doubling it) and also included 4 cloves of minced garlic (to the doubled recipe) and simmered for 1 hour.  I added about 1/2 cup of water to the sauce during simmering because it seemed too thick.  I then let it come to room temperature and paired it with recipe 70165....simply magnificent!  I'm from Chicago and take my pizza VERY seriously and this is a contender to some of my favorite pizza joints.  EXCELLENT!
81611,114392,2008-04-12,5,"The end of the search, like someone else said. Pizza doesn't get much better."
252816,114392,2008-04-19,5,"My DH has been craving a pizza. We live 20 miles from a good pizzaerri..I decided to make my own..This recipe is wonderful. And sooooo thick...I made my own crust #70165,,Took care of our cravings..I will definitely be making this again..Thank U...."
248023,114392,2008-08-20,4,"Yummy!  We felt like homemade pizza last night and this sauce looked really good...  and it was!  It was quite thick even before I simmered it and since I was not going to use it for a couple of hours, decided to add in a 1/4c of water so it wouldn't burn.  I was leary of the fennel seeds but added them in anyway...  they made the sauce!!!  This is a very hearty and flavorful sauce...  most of the time I prefer a ""fresher"" tasting sauce but this one was perfect for a a nice cheesy pizza...  I used only half the recipe for 1 12in pizza so I have the other half in the freezer, ready whenever we are craving pizza again...  Thanks for sharing!!!"
368078,114392,2008-12-05,5,"5 stars is not enough for this wonderful recipe!!  We made just as directed, and simmered for 15 minutes.  Perfect!! We used 1/2 for our pizza and plan to use the additional 1/2 for a pasta sauce.  Next time we will definitely make a double batch and freeze the left overs.  Yummy!!!"
264017,114392,2008-12-09,5,"Great pizza sauce! Very thick and rich and makes a perfect amount for one large pizza. If needed for 2 pizzas, you could spread it thinner, but we lke it on the heavy side. Yum all the way!"
632249,114392,2009-02-04,5,"Update Feb/09  We just love this sauce so I made another batch today and have sent a photo. I now increase the tomato sauce to a 14oz can and it still tastes great and is still thick. Nov 17/08 --If you call eating it straight from the pot a 5* recipe then this was certainly 5*.  I could not keep from ""testing"" it several times while it simmered. MMMMMMMM.  My search has ended, this is the pizza sauce for us. Thx so very much for sharing!"
222433,114392,2009-03-20,5,"Excellent! I doubled the recipe and stuck half in the freezer for another time. Thanks, will definitely make again."
400420,114392,2009-05-23,5,"I was making some pizza rolls for a party this afternoon and realized I was all out of sauce.  I looked for something that seemed good and quick and this fit the bill.  I did skip the celery, bay leaf and fennel seed, but added mushrooms, extra onions and parmesan.  I also wasn't paying good enough attention and added a 14 oz can of tomato sauce instead of an 8 oz can.  Not sure if it made a big difference, but it was still great! I'll be keeping this recipe for sure!  Thanks!"
140132,114392,2009-06-10,5,OMG..... this sauce is awesome!  I made this for homemade pizza tonight and we LOVED it.  I agree and think its a good idea to triple and freeze this.  I made as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.
768828,114392,2009-09-13,5,"This was sooo good; as good if not better than that you buy, plus way cheaper.  I'm making my second batch so I'll have some to keep in the freezer for a quick meal. Thanks for a great recipe."
126440,114392,2009-11-21,5,Wonderful.  I used this with thin crusted pizza and pepperoni.  I had the last piece for lunch.  Loved it.
1133190,114392,2010-02-10,4,"This sauce was good, I've just made other sauces I like a little more.  I did like the onion and celery in the sauce!  It was a little thicker than I'm used to.  We also doubled the sugar called for as we like it a bit sweeter."
318235,114392,2010-02-16,5,"You are right, this is the ultimate! Delicious pizza sauce I will be using again and again. Now if I could just get the crust right...."
229524,114392,2010-04-10,2,"I decided to try a different pizza sauce and since this had so many 5 stars ratings I thought I would give it a try.  It was okay.  My husband who likes pretty much everything, did care for it either.  It never hurts to try a new recipe....in this case I will stick with my old pizza sauce recipe."
58836,114392,2010-06-09,5,This was very good pizza sauce.  Didn't have the celery or fennel but it was good anyway.  Very easy too!
333017,114392,2010-07-30,0,"This was a full bodied pizza sauce...probably enough for 3 pizzas.  I did forget to add the parmesan cheese, but that didn't hurt the final taste.  I was thinking that I might have to take my blender to the final product, but everything just ""melted"" into the sauce wonderfully.  Definately use the fennel and bay leaf...it makes the sauce.  I used it on Karen's Crust Pizza (29002).  Great taste, great flavor!!!"
199020,114392,2011-01-11,5,"Delish! Much better than store-bought and easy, too!"
1179225,114392,2011-02-14,5,Perfect! Wouldn't change a thing. The fennel is the key. This sauce has just the right amount of zing.Thanks so much for posting.
532289,114392,2012-09-03,5,Good.  Thanks for sharing.
176615,114392,2012-11-11,5,"Very good, thick pizza sauce. I minced the celery and onion to avoid chunks. Love the fennel. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
969481,114392,2013-04-20,5,OMG YUM!!! I used this sauce with recipe/italian-saucy-sausage-sub-20037 and recipe/weight-watchers-pita-pizza-230254. This pizza sauce will be my family&#039;s &quot;go-to&quot; pizza sauce from now on! Thanks for sharing.
844554,114392,2014-01-27,5,Couldn&#039;t make it any better! Hubby said who needs takeout anymore? I froze in little baggies since we don&#039;t like a lot of sauce on our pizza and am going to make one for Super Bowl Sunday. Thanks so much!
37036,101104,2002-06-30,5,This is the pumpkin pie recipe I've been using for years!  It's wonderful... top with Cool Whip before serving.
101823,101104,2003-11-28,5,"This is a staple pumpkin pie recipe.  Everyone loves it.  I have added a little more spices, or a little dark rum, but it is wonderful just the way it is.  I have tried other pumpkin pie recipes, but this is the one everyone wants."
74652,101104,2003-11-29,5,This is the recipe I have used for years.  Its easy and it always turns out perfect!
64203,101104,2004-10-24,5,"I have tried many, MANY pumpkin pie recipes and this is the one I come back to year after year! The has delicious flavor and is the pie that I'm in charge of bringing every holiday. Thanks for posting this!"
26512,101104,2004-11-27,5,"Yep, what all the other 15 reviewers of this recipe said...excellent! It had been quite some time since I made a pumpkin pie, I'm not a baker. But this was really easy and had that classic pumpkin pie taste and texture. I received a thumbs up from my Mother. It's a keeper. Thanks for sharing!"
188119,101104,2005-07-21,5,"This was really great! I must have gotten small pie pans though, because this recipe seemed to make 2 pies instead of 1.  Oh well, more to eat.  Thanks a lot!"
53932,101104,2005-09-29,5,This is on our family's table every Thanksgiving as well and it always tastes great. I don't mess with a classic--it's perfect as is.
47559,101104,2005-11-24,5,I've made this pie for so many years because it's still the best one I've ever tried.  Delicious!
229850,101104,2005-11-24,5,"This recipe is just a little different from the one I normally use, but the proof was in the pie. My pie not only tasted great. It looked fabulous. Not  a crack in it, just right.
Thanx for sharing"
119466,101104,2005-11-27,5,"This was the first pumpkin pie I ever made, and I have since used the recipe many times over the years. I usually add extra spices, but it's a wonderful basic pumpkin pie recipe--thanks for posting it!"
22015,101104,2005-12-27,5,This is my favorite all time pumpkin pie recipe.   Simple but filled with holiday memories and wonderful taste.   This is definitely the only pumpkin pie I make and the recipe that my daughter asked me to pass on to her.
125640,101104,2006-04-19,5,"I subbed 1/4 cup splenda for 1/4 cup of the sugar, but otherwise made exactly as directed. I had a slight problem with the outer edge of the pie overcooking before the middle had a chance to solidify, but it was probably a problem with the altitude. It tasted great (not too sweet like a lot of pies), but next time I will probably try adding a bit more of the spices with maybe a touch of vanilla just for that little extra kick."
68960,101104,2006-05-04,5,"This was really different for us being in Australia but we loved it.  I managed to get a tin of Libby's pumpkin puree in a shop in Brisbane. I used a store bought sweet pie crust and found the mixture was too much for just one crust, I needed two. Cooked exactally as the recipe was written.  My four year old daughter went crazy over it - she ate 2 huge slices. Will definitely make again."
91392,101104,2006-09-28,5,"The only pumpkin pie recipe you need.  No others taste quite right to me.  Sometimes I use a bit less of the milk, it depends on the consistency of the pumpkin, I prefer a firmer pie than a squishier one."
8688,101104,2006-09-30,5,This is my standard recipe for pumpkin pie. I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I make my own crust.  It's perfect! ; )
37305,101104,2006-11-23,5,This recipe produced the best pumpkin pie I've ever made.  I did add a 1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg and I baked in a 10 inch regular pie pan instead of a 9 inch deep-dish.  Really just perfect and no need to look around for another pumpkin pie recipe.  This one is it!
104295,101104,2006-11-24,5,This is the pie recipe I always use.  Classic pumpkin pie.  A nice addition to my Thanksgiving table this year!
377581,101104,2007-01-19,5,This is the best recipe for pumpkin pie! This was delicious and very easy to make with little time. Super! Thanks for sharing!
324621,101104,2007-10-15,5,I've made this 3 times in the last 2 weeks and everyone I've served it to has loved it! I just got the recipe off the back of the can of Libby's solid pack pumpkin and looked it up here on Zaar for the nutrition facts. Great recipe!
98919,101104,2007-11-15,5,This is the recipe my hubby's mom always made so I know it is at least 31 years old. Thanks KatieMom84 for posting it....it is the only pumpkin pie recipe I use too and you made it easy to find!!
461834,101104,2007-11-24,5,"Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  It turned out wonderfully!!  I used a frozen pie crust, and I didn't prebake, that came in a metal pan.  The crust was done on the bottom and the edges didn't even burn.  Great recipe!!"
377039,101104,2007-12-03,4,"This made a simple, classic Pumpkin Pie -- no more and no less.  It was easy and good, but didn't stand out from the crowd."
218535,101104,2008-02-03,5,Made pumpkin pie for the first time using this recipe. It was delicious.
47907,101104,2008-11-29,5,"This is my go-to pumpkin pie recipe.  It always comes out great and it's delicious.  This year, I subbed Splenda for the sugar and lite evaporated milk with wonderful results.  Thanks for posting!"
914720,101104,2008-11-29,5,"This is the only pumpkin pie recipe our family uses.  We use the individual spices instead of the pumpkin pie spice, and use a refrigerated Pillsbury pie crust.  We prefer it the second day, when it's cold and the flavors have had time to blend."
394077,101104,2009-05-03,3,"I want to like this recipe since there are so many high ratings.  The first time I made it I thought I might have done something wrong. So, to be fair,  I made it again and it turned out the same thing.  The flavor is average tasting too me.  Nothing special. But these pies are very easy to do."
140132,101104,2009-11-09,5,"Absolutely delicious pumpkin pie!  I made this for my family yesterday and we loved it!  DH went for seconds, which is a feat in itself....lol.  I plan on making this for our holidays every year.  Thank you for sharing this with us."
172369,101104,2009-11-13,0,"I made this pie with spenda in place of the sugar and it was very good, I will make this again, thanks for sharing this recipe."
189475,101104,2009-12-06,5,"This was better than any store-bought pumpkin pie I've ever had. It was so easy to make that I really doubt I'll ever buy a store-bought one again. Also, I liked that it cost less than $4 to make it. I didn't use ground cloves since they were expensive ($9.99). I just used extra cinnamon and ginger to make up for it. I also didn't use whipped cream because I thought it was good enough without it. I had to bake mine for 15 mins plus the full 50 mins. Thanks so much for sharing this excellent recipe!"
191533,101104,2009-12-08,5,"Perfect flavor, my hubby says. But after 50min. in the oven and the knife came out clean, it still didn't set up as firm as we thought it should. I will try baking it longer next time?"
185926,101104,2009-12-25,5,I made this pie for Thanksgiving and everyone who ate it loved it.  Hubby said it was the best pumpkin pie he's ever tasted.  Very easy to do.  I would make this again.  Thank you.
1581225,101104,2010-04-08,5,"Can't get canned pumpkin puree here in Australia (that I can find), so I made my own from fresh pumpkin, and used two sweet flan pastries instead of the one deep dish pie pastry (couldn't find that in my supermarket either), but it turned out great still! Great recipe, thanks katiemom!"
371738,101104,2010-11-21,5,"Unfortunately I can't find cloves in Beijing, so that was missing, but no fault of the recipe as written.  I used recipe #51537 for the pie crust.  Worked well, though I won't pre-bake it next time.  Thanks for helping us to have some pumpkin pie in China!"
1179225,101104,2011-11-25,5,Pumpkin pie doesn't get better than this!
407007,101104,2012-11-22,5,Easy & fabulous recipe for pumpkin pie! Took this to our family gathering and everyone loved it! I will use this one for all holidays from now on! :) Thanks for sharing!
362983,101104,2018-10-15,5,"This has definitely been my staple pumpkin pie recipe; I love it! The spices aren't overpowering, it's got a really nice balance of flavours: a bit creamy yet light and still full of flavour. I've made it with a no-roll pie crust (51537) and it works wonderfully. Everyone loves this pie.. it never lasts long in this house! Thanks! [Edit: lately I've made some tweaks. I sub half the sugar for brown sugar, and increase the amount of spices by 1.5 to 2 times the original amounts. Turns out great!]"
27643,21761,2002-04-02,5,"We had this as one of the side dishes for Easter dinner. It was a big hit! It complimented the ham so nicely. The combination af garlic and parmesan is really delicious on brussel sprouts. A very easy to do recipe, this one is a keeper for sure!
Thanks!!"
4470,21761,2002-04-05,5,"The recipe is perfect the way it is but I always have to play around a bit Sooooo I cut out the butter, sprayed the inside of a plastic bag  with lite olive oil, added powdered garlic (not often I use it vs real garlic) added the parmesan and sprouts to the bag shook the bag to coat the sproats and then baked them on a baking stone in a 375F oven for 30 minutes. The result was very nice and a bit lower cal.  I still prefer your recipe as is!   I am actually liking Sproats!"
18391,21761,2002-04-24,5,This was excellent!! my husband loved it and asked me to try it with other veggies as well .. thanks
13483,21761,2002-10-17,5,I like sprouts and this was a unique way to cook them.  I overdid them a tad but even that was good!!!  I liked the more black than brown cut side of the sprouts.  Easy to do as well.  Thanks Tracy.
7108,21761,2002-10-20,5,"I now love brussel sprouts!  I used to gag at the smell of them; I couldn't get enough of these!  My mom actually made these and brought them over, coaxing me to try one; and I am glad I did.  They were delicious!"
95743,21761,2003-10-31,4,"Very, very good.  Didn't realize the sprouts would soak up all the oil and butter.  I would definitely cut way back next time."
101823,21761,2004-03-09,4,"Brussel sprouts are one of my husband's favorite vegetables.  These were awesome.  In my rush to get dinner on the table, I forgot to add the grated parmesan cheese, but still found the flavor to be great.  Loved the browned bits!"
49304,21761,2004-10-26,5,"We love brussel sprouts, this is a delicious easy recipe, used 1 extra clove of garlic as we are all garlic lovers. The Parmesan cheese is a nice addition to the sprouts. I served them as a side dish to guest this weekend, Everyone really enjoyed them. The recipe is defiantly a keeper, Thank you Tracy."
37449,21761,2005-01-09,5,"Well, this was just delicious! My husband wants his brussel sprouts this way from now on. Thanks Tracy for a lovely way to fix sprouts! :)"
119466,21761,2005-04-06,5,"I just love Brussels sprouts, but this technique takes them to a new level. They were fantastic! Thanks, Tracy."
35526,21761,2005-04-20,5,Simple and delicious.  BIG HIT EVEN WITH THE KIDS!!  We love brussel sprouts and this recipe would make even someone who is iffy on them love them.  Use plenty of salt!!
227607,21761,2006-05-18,4,"None of us liked this at all...I gave 4 stars because this is just a matter of taste.  We just really don't like brusell sprouts and this recipe did not change that for us :( The garlic butter sauce with parmesan was however, very good."
280271,21761,2006-07-09,5,Tracy K heres another 5 star for you!! Both DH and I really like brussels sprouts and this one is execptional. You can really taste the sprouts. They are not over powered by the other ingredients. They just enhance the flavor. This is going in my 5 star cookbook. Thanks for posting!
362983,21761,2007-01-02,5,"I've only baked my sprouts before, so I had my doubts with this recipe but this was outstanding!! The instructions were easy to follow and the timing was perfect. The sprouts were beautifully browned and were simply delicious and tender. I kept the garlic since I love my garlic, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I think this is my new favourite way of preparing brussels sprouts!"
126104,21761,2007-04-06,5,"Tracy, my love, you have converted me.  I can actually say I LOVED these suckers.  I tried them prior to adding cheese, salt and/or pepper, and they were still yummy.  I actually ate about half of this waiting for my steak to cook.

I am now a brussels sprouts lover, and I can't believe it!!!  Why did I wait so darn long to try them??  lol"
158086,21761,2007-09-18,5,"These are out of this world, I served these to dinner guests and we were wishing I had made up a bigger batch....we ate them all up.  Yummy"
53932,21761,2008-01-13,5,These were just excellent.  Loved the buttery garlic flavor and the ease of preparation.
369715,21761,2008-01-13,4,These were good and easy to make. I used frozen brussel sprouts and didn't cut them in half. Followed the rest of the recipe as written adding the optional parmesan cheese.
207176,21761,2008-01-22,5,Thanks!  It was yummy with the Parmesan and very easy to prepare. Wish my kids would have tried it.
331557,21761,2008-04-04,3,These were good - I liked them more than my boyfriend did.  He said that without the paremesan cheese they would have been too bland and I don't think he is far off.  I did add two more cloves of garlic to try and make that flavour stronger.  I will probably make these again for myself.  Thanks for posting.
140132,21761,2008-06-26,5,"Very good.  I made this the other night for a veggie and my family loved them.  I really liked the addition  of parmesan cheese, delicious.  Thank you for posting."
844554,21761,2008-10-22,5,"You definitely have a great winner here!! Normally I roast the sprouts in the oven, but I like this better -- quicker and doesn't heat up kitchen. I left the garlic in and put parmesan on at end. Next time, I'll leave the parmesan off and take the garlic out, put sprouts in, then put garlic back in for 1 minute before serving. Either way, will make again and again. Thank you!!"
185926,21761,2008-10-29,5,"I've died and gone to brussel sprout heaven. OH MY! These are SOOO....good. My husband and I ate them fast. The kids did not care for them but they don't know good vegetables. Who knew brussel sprouts could taste so decadent? I followed the recipe exactly. Tasted it before adding parmesan and decided that was not necessary. Buttery and nutty. Sinfully good. THANK YOU!  I've made it twice in one week.  The second time I did not remove the garlic cloves when I added the sprouts, I just put them on top fo the sprouts as there's hardly enough room in my 12"" pan to accomodate all the 20 sprouts I made.  But the garlic was not burnt by the time the sprouts were cooked, they were slightly brown and soft and delicious.  Great to mash into a piece of crusty bread and enjoy.  We've become Brussel Sprout eating fools."
928301,21761,2009-06-30,5,Yummy!
368078,21761,2009-10-13,5,"MMMMmmmmm!!  We used double the sprouts, but the same amount of butter/olive oil.  We also minced the garlic cloves and didn't remove them.  They took a little longer to cook with the extra sprouts (25 minutes), but were yummy!!  Thanks, Tracy :)"
914720,21761,2009-11-20,4,Very nice.  I may cut back on the oil and butter next time - it was a tad rich for our tastes.  I used my electric skillet to make a large batch with no problems.  Thanks for posting!
145352,21761,2009-11-28,5,Very good and easy!
74281,21761,2010-03-23,5,"As Tracy K mentioned in the directions of her recipe, the sprouts had a very nice and browned, with a nutty, buttery flavor enhanced by garlic. And it was really simple to make as well. The only thing I couldn't bear to do was ""discard"" the garlic (which I doubled), so after the sprouts cooked I tossed it back in and served the sprouts with clumps of nicely browned, sweet garlic. Excellent recipe. I could have eaten the entier doubled recipe with double double garlic by myself!"
1122161,21761,2010-06-05,5,"These were very good brussel sprouts! I did have to use frozen, but I used baby sprouts cut in half and did everything else per instructions and they came out so good! I will be making these all the time! Thanks for posting."
439797,21761,2010-11-16,5,Delicious!
400420,21761,2010-12-26,5,"Super delicious! I made these for Christmas dinner. I love brussel sprouts, but hate it when they are soggy.  I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and just love the way the outer leaves get nice and brown, and the inner part stays a little bit crispy.  I used 20 sprouts and couldn't fit them all in the pan cut side down, so I did it that way with as many as would fit, then just threw the rest of them in on top.  They eventually all got browned and I left the garlic in the pan - love it when it gets all carmelized!  At the end of the night, there were only about 6 halves left - and brussel sprouts are one of those things that not everyone likes!.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!"
789516,21761,2011-12-13,5,These were the best brussel sprouts I've ever eaten!  I used 4 cloves of garlic.  The parmesan would definitely put these over the top. I had to put the lid on the last couple minutes to get the tops cooked  Make sure to season with salt and pepper!!
222564,21761,2013-01-01,5,Love them!
333017,21761,2014-04-28,5,These Brussels sprouts were excellent.  I would certainly do these ones again!  Yum!  Kudos on a great find!!!
53932,137262,2005-11-05,5,I marinated whole chicken breasts in this very flavorful marinade and the results were just superb. I'm sure this would have been even better if I had taken the time to bone the chicken and cut it into chunks as indicated in the recipe. I also baked the chicken at 350 for an hour rather than grilling so will be trying this again and following the recipe!
64583,137262,2005-11-14,5,"This is so delicious. I'm always looking for new marinades to try that do not use overly salty ingredients like teriyaki or soy sauce.  I only marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes and it was still very flavorful.  I served it with salad, rice and roasted sweet potatoes and onions.  Tomorrows lunch will be the leftover sliced chicken over a salad.    "
146047,137262,2006-03-26,5,Delicious!
52262,137262,2006-06-16,5,"My family and I were pleasantly surprised when we tasted the chicken. It was delicious! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and only had time to marinate for about four hours. I grilled the breasts but did not baste with additional marinade. I took the extra marinade and boiled it for a few minutes on the stove. I put some of this marinade on the finished product but still had some leftover."
92816,137262,2006-06-19,4,"This was ok,not as good as I had expected.I marinated 2 bone-in chicken breasts for 24 hours.I thought there would be more flavor to the marinade.It hardly made any difference to the chicken."
68460,137262,2006-12-14,5,"This is a wonderful marinade.  I used it tonight on pork chops and only marinated them for about 2-3 hours and then broiled them in my oven.  Meat-starved DH loved them and I liked em too.  We had them with shiitake risotto and green beans.  I'll do this again on the BBQ next summer.  Great marinade, thanks Stack! :)"
142335,137262,2007-02-07,5,This is my NOW favorite chicken marinade. I have baked it and grilled it on the GeorgeF. grill. It always tastes wonderful! I've found it also goes great with Recipe #200504. Thanks!
280166,137262,2007-02-13,4,Very tasty!  I also made a yummy broth from the carcass and wings.  Would definitely use again!
135887,137262,2007-06-10,5,"This marinade was really good.  I added green onions instead of shallots and the chicken turned out flavorful, moist and tender after marinading for about 24 hours.  Thanks for sharing."
358796,137262,2007-07-17,5,"The most outstanding marinated grilled chicken! The fresh lemon and parsley, the marjoram and pepper... it all works perfectly and makes for a super moist, juicy and flavorful chicken breast! Make this today!"
222055,137262,2007-08-07,5,Great marinade! Thank you for sharing Stacky!!!
188119,137262,2007-08-31,5,"yum, pretty good =)
Even though I pan-fried it until ""well burnt"", the flavors were still really good!  Thanks, I will try this again, hopefully on the grill one day"
207176,137262,2007-10-15,5,"I am SO HAPPY with this Everyone in my family loved it. I used chicken tenderloins and marinated 24 hours. I used my grill pan and I boiled the extra marinade to pour over the chicken after I put it on a serving platter. This is like a chicken I get in a local restaurant here which is served over salad with pita wedges and the marinade as a ""dressing."" I will make this often! Thank you so much."
520150,137262,2008-02-07,4,"Both DH & I really enjoyed this.  However, for our tastes, next time I will reduce both the lemon juice & salt by just a touch.  I liked the amount of lemon & he liked the amount of salt!  I was going to post a picture, but Sandi's is way better than mine!  Thank you very much - this was super easy and we enjoyed it.  I will be making this again."
394077,137262,2008-04-10,5,"How funny, this recipe is very similar to my personal recipe. The only thing that is different is that I also add 1 teaspoon of rosemarry.  Stacky is right, this is a great marinade that I always use with lamb chops.  I will try it with chicken the next time"
37449,137262,2008-06-18,5,I was looking for a good recipe for chicken breast for my DH and came across this little gem! My husband loved it. I marinated about 28 hours. He licked his plate! :shock: Thank you! Made for ZWT4.
232480,137262,2008-08-28,5,"Excellent!  I was afraid that such a long marinating time would ruin the chicken if the lemon juice ""cooked"" the meat before grilling.  Well, the acid did cook the meat a big but it certainly did NOT ruin the chicken!  So, so good...I'm glad I had an overabundance of shallots to use up!"
847160,137262,2009-01-06,5,wooow ... the best herb marinade i ever taste
93006,137262,2009-02-10,5,"Terrific marinade and I was only able to let the chicken marinate for a few hours.  Perfect herb combo.  I was concerned it would be too lemony, but my picky DH never even noticed it.  I only got 4 servings out of this - 4 delicious chicken breasts.  Can't imagine it any way but grilled!  Will use this one often."
187281,137262,2009-07-15,3,"This recipe was just okay for us---we only marinated for one hour and that still left a strong lemon flavor.  The hanging point for us was how much the lemon seemed to overpower the other ingredients.  Just not our taste, I guess.  It did taste better diced up over a caesar salad, however."
620763,137262,2009-07-15,5,Very tasty chicken! I marinated for about 7 hours and it was very well seasoned. I used onion instead of shallot and dried parsley because I did not have fresh.
140132,137262,2010-05-31,5,"Wonderful, light chicken marinade.  It was simple and didn't drown out the chicken.  I used my fresh herbs and marinated about `18 hours.  DH grilled and I served with rice pilaf and brussel sprouts.  Than you for a delicious meal."
1179225,137262,2011-09-09,5,"Excellent chicken! I used half the amount of oil and used bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts and let mine marinate for about 10 hours. DH grilled them to perfection. The aroma of the chicken grilling must have been driving our neighbors crazy. I'm looking forward to using the leftovers for chicken wraps. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe."
928301,137262,2012-07-24,5,I liked it.  Very nice flavor.  I might add a little salt though for more.
280271,137262,2013-07-03,5,I really don&#039;t know why I&#039;m posting my review here...there are so many great ones already...I guess I just want to be able to know I&#039;ve made this delicious dish...I prepared it using chicken tenderloins and cooking them on skewers...I marinaded the meat for 48 hours and it came out so tender and moist...we loved the flavors...thanks for posting it =)
103876,137262,2013-07-10,5,Very flavorful.  Just the right balance of lemon and herbs.  Will make extra next time as I didn&#039;t have any left over for lunch the next day.
33159,137262,2013-08-07,4,We enjoyed this recipe.  Left out the shallots but followed otherwise.
32058,137262,2014-06-02,4,I made this after reading all the stellar reviews.  I was a bit disappointed.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out bland IMO.
298447,137262,2015-06-07,5,"This is yummy grilling goodness at its best. I am adding this to my low carb arsenal.  We used chicken, but can&#039;t wait to try it with lamb as well.  And, as stated...yes, it is awesome cold on salads!"
68460,79563,2005-04-02,5,"This is the best split pea soup I've ever made or eaten.  I only had 1 1/2 C. of dried split peas so I added 1/2 C. lentils and that made a fine addition.  I used 10 cups of water and it was quite soupy so I left the lid off the pot and it thickened up very nicely towards the end of the 1 1/2 hours cook time.  I'll certainly be making this again, thanks so much for posting this recipe Uncle Bill!"
47559,79563,2005-04-08,5,"Simply the best!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 8 cups of water because I like a thicker pea soup.  There was no need to puree it, as the peas dissolved into a lovely thick creamy soup. It was absolutely delicious.  I can't think of any possible improvement."
59473,79563,2005-05-23,5,WOW this was good soup. I had a ham bone in the freezer left over from Easter which still had a lot of meat on it. I used yellow split peas and instead of beef cubes I used ham cubes. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Uncle Bill for a great recipe.
89831,79563,2005-08-16,5,"FANTASTIC!!!! I had a huge ham bone sitting in my freezer, and I wanted to make your recipe, I was just waiting for a cooler day, and today was it! I used 5 cups of chicken broth and 5 cups water in place of all 12 cups water, and only used 1 beef cube... wonderful smokey taste that thickened up to just the right consistancy. I let it simmer slowley for about 2 hours, we really enjoyed this with homemade crusty buns...Uncle Bill has done it again! thanks for another winner!...Kitten:)"
53932,79563,2005-10-07,5,"What a great soup!  I used only 8 cups of water and had a nice, thick soup.  As I was somewhat pressed for time, I simmered the peas for 20 minutes (rather than letting them sit for an hour in boiling water).  Added 2 small bay leaves, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!"
138429,79563,2006-02-28,5,Excellent soup!!   Followed the recipe and it turned out perfect. The  beef bouillon gave it the extra flavor. In my keepers file this recipe will go. Thanks Uncle Bill.
68960,79563,2006-05-04,5,"Uncle Bill we loved this. It's getting cooler is Qld, Aust now and this was perfect. I grated my carrot and used bacon hocks which my butcher cut up into smaller pieces for me.  I also used the full 12 cups of water and I'm glad I did. It ended up simmering on the stove all afternoon which meant that I didn't need to puree as the split peas and veggies were so very soft - yum. I took the lid off and turned it up slightly higher allowing the soup to reduce down. Both my 2 and 4 year olds loved this. Served with Kittencals Delicious Cheesy Parmesan Garlic Bread Recipe #105726. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe :)"
146047,79563,2006-10-01,5,"Loved this soup, Uncle Bill. So easy to make and very satisfying. Perfect with a chunk of crusty bread for dinner on a chilly, rainy evening!  I added 1 tsp thyme and 2 bay leaves. Also, I used about 1/2 c salt pork rather than the ham bone. Sauteed it up with the onions, carrots, and celery (and 2 cloves of garlic) prior to simmering it all with beef stock and split peas. Excellent flavors-- my husband went for seconds and said it's really good. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch. Thanks for posting!"
229850,79563,2006-10-30,5,"OMG I could have sworn I rated this weeks ago. I loved this, my whole family did. I have never eaten this before, the green color turned me off, and I am not a fan of peas. Wow what have I been missing? Just one of the best most econimcal soups you can imagine. I did not have a ham bone, so I used a ham steak, cut into small peices and even put the bone in, can't wait till I have a real ham bone!!!!!!!!! This was unbelievably good, even if it is green!!!!!ha"
60260,79563,2006-12-01,5,"DH requested Split Pea Soup and I decided to give this recipe a try.  I didn't have any ham bones in the freezer so I bought 2 smoked ham hocks and used a ham steak for the chunked meat (hocks gross me out so I used for flavor only.) Following the advice of others I used 5 cups of water and 5 cups chicken stock and upped the thyme to 1/4 tsp. After the 1st step of having the beans sit for 1 hour, I simmered for 2 hours and the texture was perfect the soup was thick but not globby, no blending needed and there was still chunks of carrot.  Next time I make I will make sure to use low sodium broth and possibly lose the additional salt. It was a bit on the salty side the way I made it but easily fixed.  Great soup - the family loved it!  Thanks for posting Uncle Bill."
91392,79563,2006-12-31,5,"Just changed to 5 stars--this was even better cooled down a bit.  Don't eat it really hot.  Good, healthy, long, but easy to make.  A winner.  My French husband said it was better than his mother's."
7108,79563,2007-02-25,5,"Excellent!  I had a  large, frozen ham bone in my freezer since Thanksgiving and used it up on this soup.  I omitted the salt and used a 1 1/2 cubes of ham boullion instead of the beef.  After I removed the ham bone, I pureed the soup then added the remaining meat off the bone.  Thanks for posting; it's delicious!"
188119,79563,2007-06-13,5,"I didn't have any beef bouillon cubes, but it was still really good!   This made a lot of food and was a great way to use up a ham bone instead of throwing it away.  Glad I found this recipe before I trashed it.  Thanks a lot!"
185285,79563,2007-08-20,5,"I recently had surgery and wanted to make a few dishes that I could eat the week I was recovering. I'm so glad I chose this one! The flavors of this dish seemed to develop over a few days and the soup's taste really kept getting better. Wonderful, wonderful soup."
13796,79563,2007-09-17,5,Just like my mom makes! I cut the water back to 9 cups. I also had to use smoked turkey necks in place of the ham bone. ... but to make up for it during the last half hour of simmering I added 8 ounces of finely chopped ham steak.  Very delicious. Thanks for another good recipe Uncle Bill! By the way... I'm still using your method for cooking steaks and it has NEVER FAILED me.
169969,79563,2009-01-19,5,Excellent Split Pea Soup. I will make this recipe EVERY time I have leftover ham-bone! Thank you Uncle Bill!
470351,79563,2009-02-28,5,"WOW!!!  Superb!!  I can't believe how flavorful this is and how low in fat!!!!!  My husband is one of those guys that ""thinks"" he hates something even though he hasn't tried it in 20 years.  He scoffed at my making this..and I was making it for myself...took one taste and went crazy for this!  I wish I would have doubled the recipe now!  I bought pork hocks from the grocery store since I buy boneless hams...I followed the rest of the recipe just as stated and it was THE BEST!!!!!!  I didn't puree anything because I love the large bits of pea.  The consistency was perfect with the stated 8 cups of water and I diced up some cooked ham I'd made the night before to add.  Froze most of it and will thaw to eat daily for lunch.  Just LOVED it!  Thanks Uncle Bill!"
182624,79563,2009-05-03,5,"Amazing!  Tastes like a cream soup but it's just good ol' healthy peas!  Will never use another recipe.  You rock, Uncle Bill!"
185446,79563,2009-10-08,5,"I have tried four of Uncle Bill's soup recipes so far.  Each has been outstanding, including this one.  Didn't change a thing, other than use Bill's suggestions of chicken broth and liquid hickory smoke.  What a flavorful soup--I can hardly wait to try others (and he has lots of soup recipes) from this amazing chef."
185926,79563,2009-11-28,5,"Delicious.  I just put everything together in a pot and bring to a boil, simmer for 1.5 hour.  Yummy.  Couldn't be easier.  8 Cups of water was perfect."
937635,79563,2009-12-28,5,Wonderful soup! I love RecipeZaar :) I used 8 cups of water as written and then added a little more (probably about 2 cups) so that the ham bone was covered. I also added more ham to the soup after it was finished and let it simmer for a few minutes to warm through. I think the sugary coating of the ham adds a nice subtle sweetness to this soup. A+!
142335,79563,2010-04-18,5,"I'm on the band wagon! A few potatoes jumped in, other that that made as directed. Perfect with fresh garlic crusty bead on the side...yum."
653438,79563,2011-01-02,5,I made this last week and forgot to review this.  WONDERFUL...if I could give more than 5 stars I would.  Followed the directions only adding 3 minced garlic cloves and 2 diced potatoes....heaven.  Definately going into my Favorites of 2010.  Thank you Uncle Bill for submitting such a delicious recipe.
126440,79563,2011-02-01,5,DH said wonderful soup.  I made this for him using leftover ham bone.  Easy to do but took longer than stated.  Left out the salt and was still great.
81611,79563,2011-07-22,5,"Yes, here in Alberta it can be soup weather even in July. This was my first time to make pea soup, because it is usually my husband's job, but I already had the ham bone defrosted and the chicken stock fresh, and he was busy. I did add his signature rinsed can of peas and cup of frozen peas at the end (for texture and color). This only feeds about 7 for us, but since there are only 6 of us, it works fine. DH was impressed, which is hard to do."
64642,79563,2012-01-10,5,"What terrific comfort food on a cold, blowy, wet winter's day.  I used two smoked ham hocks for the hambone and beef stock concentrate instead of the bouillon.  Big hit!"
140132,79563,2012-10-29,5,"Mmmmmmm....comforting soup for the cold weather.  I made this using a ham hock and it turned out fantastic.  The flavor was spot on to what I remember my mom making.  I pureed half the soup and left the other half ""chunky"" and it was perfect for us.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us, I'm always wanting some different soups for the winter time and I'm glad we chose yours."
242484,53878,2009-09-09,3,Just okay for us...
160974,66596,2004-10-25,5,This was exactly what it claimed to be: the ultimate Greek salad! There is so much flavor in the salad dressing with the perfect spice blend. I brought it to a party and it disappeared fast.
56087,66596,2003-08-07,5,"I had tried my first Greek Salad in a Pizza Restaurant this year, and was instantly hooked.  First thing I did was come look in Zaar for a recipe.  Tried this one and it's SUPER!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
52543,66596,2003-10-06,5,I've tried many recipes for Greek salad & this is definitely THE BEST! The only thing that I did differently was to use a combo of romaine & head lettuce. Thanx for sharing!
74652,66596,2003-10-27,5,I made this today leaving out the Romaine and instead turned it into a pasta salad using tri-color Rotini.  It was fabulous and the dressing was out of this world.  A definite keeper!  I love Greek food and worked in a Greek restaurant for years and the dressing  was very authentic and tasted fresh and wonderful! I'm going to make it with the romaine next time.
53932,66596,2005-07-28,5,Great salad!  I added 1/2 tsp black pepper to the dressing and used the full amount of salt. Also put some pepperocini on the salad. Thank you!
60260,66596,2004-06-27,5,"Great Salad!  This was my 1st attempt at a Greek Salad and we all loved it.  Simple ingredients with TONS of taste. I made everything ""as is"" and thought it was super."
54678,66596,2004-09-15,5,Delish! Awesome!
133174,66596,2004-09-19,5,I can sum up this review in one word Awesome!  I followed the directions for the dressing to the letter and blended it in my blender.  Probably used a little less feta cheese than called for and of course used Greek olives.  I used a seedless cucumber.  Everyone was wowed.  Thankx!
119466,66596,2004-10-11,5,This is great!  I have been trying a lot of Greek dishes  recently & this salad has accompanied several of them. The  only change I make is to scale to half because of my small family size. Thanks so much!
37036,66596,2005-04-05,5,This was delicious!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I served this salad with gyros and roasted Greek potatoes.  It made a wonderful meal!  Thanks KITTENCAL!
64583,66596,2005-04-19,5,Wow!  This is delicious.  The dressing is very zippy but we really liked it that way.  I didn't use olives (we don't care for them) and only used about 1/4 tsp. salt as I thought 2 tsp. was too salty for our tastes.  The leftovers from this great recipe will make several yummy lunches for me this week.
44383,66596,2005-06-18,5,Great Salad!  It's now my favorite. I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks alone! It's really easy to make. It makes more then enough for 2 so I use only half the recipe each time but easily have enough dressing from the first time.  Thanks for posting it.
29782,66596,2005-06-26,5,Wonderful salad! I cut the recipe in half for DH and I. This was my first attempt on making this type of dressing too. We were very thrilled with the taste. Thanks for sharing!
103876,66596,2005-07-31,5,"This is definitely a great greek salad.  With the advice of some of the reviews, I used a little less oil and a little more vinegar in the dressing.  The herbs gave it a nice seasoned flavor.  "
145352,66596,2006-01-01,5,Delicious!! I used garlic stuffed olives and sliced them!
136997,66596,2006-05-04,5,"Another winner for Kittencal! There are only 2 of us who like greek salad, so I had to adjust the amounts to 2 servings. I didn't have any trouble at all. Added the sugar and had to leave out the olives, since I didn't have any on hand. Deliciously fresh tasting. :)"
93006,66596,2006-06-10,4,"Very delicious - did add the sugar to counteract some of the tartness of the dressing, but it's not necessary.  A keeper!"
88099,66596,2006-06-10,5,Excellent Greek salad.  I made just as directed.  Loved the dressing in this.  Thanks Kitz.
177933,66596,2006-11-18,5,"Another easy, to die for salad dressing.  Thanks again!"
168462,66596,2007-01-05,5,Wonderful greek salad. I made a half batch and used one package of equal in place of the  sugar. Would not change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.
158086,66596,2007-02-01,5,"Boy was this salad a hit at my sunday dinner for my family and friends....I did add some diced beets, it was wonderful...will make over and over I bet..."
98919,66596,2007-02-11,5,This recipe was beautiful and oh so good!!  A hit at a birthday party for my sister.  I added about 3 teaspoons of sugar since I am more partial to a sweeter dressing.  Thanks for a great recipe kittencal!
32058,66596,2007-02-19,5,Made this as written...perfection!
37449,66596,2007-05-23,5,Yummy! I had this for dinner tonight with meatless riblets and Brussel sprouts. I mixed in spinach and cilantro with the romaine and used jumbo black olives. Loved it! Thank you Kitten!
331557,66596,2007-05-27,3,This was good but a tad bit too oily for our taste.  Next time I will probably cut the olive oil in half and that should still be sufficient to coat the salad.  Thanks for sharing.
231054,66596,2007-05-30,5,The recipe doesn't need another 5 star rating -- but it's so wonderful that I can't let you NOT know how much we enjoyed it.  You've done it again!  I made the dressing about 6 hours ahead of time to make sure all the flavors had time to blend with one another.  I followed your directions exactly as written and this turned out just great.  I did let the cut up Romaine sit in a bowl of ice water for several minutes prior to mixing it with the remaining ingredients --and did the same with the sliced red onion.  Do you have any idea how long the dressing stays fresh in the refrigerator?  This is a salad that I could fix for my husband and I several nights a week!!!
174991,66596,2007-06-03,5,"You just can't praise this salad and dressing too much.  It's GREAT!  Followed the recipe as stated but left out the sugar.  Everyone asked for more, and the recipe.  I'll use it often."
229524,66596,2007-06-24,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!!! I couldn't stop eating it. The dressing is incredible. I bought the Kraft Grate-It-Fresh Parmesan Cheese  for this and I know it made a difference having fresh Parmesan cheese. Will be making this often. I served it with your Greek Moussaka. Made for a wonderful dinner."
199792,66596,2007-08-19,5,"Love it, love it, love it!! We nearly licked the bowl clean. It will be made often and I thank you so much for posting such a good recipe."
347822,66596,2007-08-21,5,"Awesome salad, Kittencal!!!! The dressing was great. Next time, might use feta instead of parmesan. I also, used just 1 tsp of sugar to cut the acidity. For the salad, I halved the veggies (thought 2 romaines were too much). In addition, I added pepperoncini and red pickled eggplants that I purchased from my Middle Eastern store. Thank you loads for a great recipe ... very well liked by my guests and myself. Update - I used 2 tbsp feta cheese instead of parmesan cheese and it tasted great!!!"
8688,66596,2007-08-22,5,"Wonderful salad and dressing, Kittencal!  I made as directed for the perfect accompaniment for our steak dinner and served with recipe #185498.  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipes with us : )"
240552,66596,2007-09-07,5,"Now I know why it is famous!  Superb, Kittencal!!  I did add in the little bit of sugar to the dressing. I would sit and eat the whole salad if I could. :)  I didn't have any red onion or romaine so used yellow onion and green leaf lettuce.  Thank you, Kittencal!"
138429,66596,2007-10-15,5,"Made this salad for a family dinner and everyone loved it. I made the dressing early in the day. I did add a bit of sugar. Perfect. This recipe will be in my favorites cookbook. It being one of your recipes Kitten,it is no wonder that it would be a winner."
386849,66596,2007-11-10,5,"Great salad, Kittencal! Followed the recipe exactly and had great results. It really satisfied my craving for Greek salad. Thanks!"
140132,66596,2008-01-19,5,"I printed this recipe a long time ago, not sure if we would like such bold flavors.  Well, I made this last night and wow was it sensational.  Hubby and I couldn't get enough of it.  DH is a thousand island man only, so I wasn't sure how he would feel about this salad but he loved it.  Even took the left overs with him for lunch today.  The feta cheese in this is great, I love the sharp taste with the dressing and the rest of the ingredients.  I only wish I wouldn't have waited so long to try.  Thank you soooo much for posting, we will be making this often...Stephanie"
60992,66596,2008-01-27,5,"Ok, this IS the best Greek Salad on the planet! Why did I wait SO long to try this? I did add the optional sugar to the dressing as some of the family does not like things that are ""sharp"". I prepared the dressing in the am and tested it through the day. It did get better as time went by so please do not skip this step! I also reduced the olive oil to 3/4 cup. This will be a staple in our home from now on! Absolutely fantastic!!!!"
774665,66596,2008-04-06,5,I served this salad to company and they loved it. I can' wait to try it with pasta.
497077,66596,2008-05-27,5,DELICIOUS! This is long in coming and have made several times now. What a delight-friends and family love it too! I normally don't use all of the olive oil or the parmesan and it still tastes great. The feta is a must and I include chopped celery and a few capers. Thank you for a great recipe that allows me to serve a beautiful meal!!!
847160,66596,2008-07-15,5,grat salad
132383,66596,2008-08-26,5,We loved this salad!  We made it with the parmesan in the derssing and this was just outstanding.  It was a good change from my normal blue cheese dressing out of a jar!  I kept going to the fridge to smell the dressing (smile).
142335,66596,2008-10-22,5,Yum! I halved the dressing and it was perfect. Thank you!
191533,66596,2008-10-28,1,"I made this dressing a day ahead of time, yet it still lacked flavor. I was expecting a tangy viniagrette kind of taste and this didn't deliver. It was like eating plain oil on salad greens. Judging from the other reviews, I have to wonder if I inadvertently skipped an ingredient. I may try again."
324621,66596,2008-11-03,5,Wow! This was fantastic! I made the dressing in the morning and let it sit in the fridge all day long before putting my salad together. I halved the recipe and used 1 bunch of Romaine lettuce. Left out the red onion and the green pepper and used black olives instead of kalamata. This is the perfect Greek salad and the only one I will make from here on out!!
285039,66596,2009-03-15,5,"This is a fantastic greek salad; probably the best one I have tasted on zaar.   I reduced the salad in 1/2 to serve 4 as a side salad.  It was perfect...also, I was not able to let it sit for 2 hours and it still tasted great!"
1122161,66596,2009-05-07,5,"Wonderful Greek salad! I 4thed the recipe and was enough for 4 large side salads. This has the perfect blend of seasonings, and was the best Greek salad I have had so far! Thanks again for another great one!"
124249,66596,2009-05-29,5,"I really liked this salad.  It was very easy to prepared and the dressing was very good.
Made as written,
Thanks Kittencal.

Bullwinkle"
131021,66596,2009-06-20,5,"This dressing was so good, well okay the whole salad was great. We tossed it on our plates because I have little ones that prefer to make their own. I used my blender for mixing the dressing then put it into a cruet to serve. In fact right now I'm thinking about having some for lunch, MMmmm."
126440,66596,2009-06-29,5,This salad is heavenly.  Will have to make this at least once a week for DH.  He loved it.  Served it with Recipe #256734 and Recipe #87782.  Wonderful meal.
286851,66596,2009-07-05,4,"I served this at our annual fourth of July get together. It was a big hit. With the dressing, I did reduce the olive oil to 3/4 a cup, and I was glad I did--I believe otherwise would have been a bit too ""oily"" tasting. Did add 1 additional TBSP red wine vinegar, per husband's request that it needed a bit more ""tang."" Used 1/2 a red onion--mine was big and seemed strong. Did not find I needed but 1/4 lb feta cheese. Everyone really enjoyed it--serves a lot as a side dish. Thanks for sharing."
318235,66596,2009-08-24,4,We enjoyed this salad tonight with a loaf of bread on the side for dipping! The only change would be that it had too much feta which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients for us. Very good overall though.
368078,66596,2009-09-10,5,"Wonderful!  Kittencal, we can always count on you to have a winner, and this one was no exception.  We followed the recipe exactly, but marinated only for 1/2 hr.  It was yummy and I'm sure it would be even better with more marinating time.  Thanks!"
579298,66596,2009-10-25,5,"We tried three salads this month and this one took the cake! The dressing is simply divine! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
1269015,66596,2010-02-08,5,"Awesome salad. Thanks for another great recipe, Kittencal!"
262312,66596,2010-03-02,5,"loved it!!  the dressing was fantastic (made up a day ahead)!!  i made this for dd's spaghetti dinner birthday (i also made your parmesan meatballs and cheesy garlic bread).  for the salad i went with romaine, red bell peppers, red onions, cucumbers, and feta (skipped out on the tomatoes and olives for dd's sake).  this was a great greek salad!!  can't wait to try it with your creamy feta dressing, yum!  thanks kitten!"
482376,66596,2010-09-08,5,"Fabulous Greek salad. The dressing was out-of-this-world good. My daughter never puts dressing on her salads, but LOVED this one. Everything was super easy to put together and was delicious to eat. The only thing I left out was the green pepper. Thanks for a wonderful Greek salad recipe! :)"
55578,66596,2011-03-15,5,I've made this several times!  Thanks for a great recipe
236170,66596,2011-09-15,5,Great salad! I needed to bring a salad to a party so I just looked at the highest rating recipes on food.com and this one fit the bill. I'm so glad I chose it because it was delicious! The dressing was a perfect combination and it tasted great over the veggies. Thanks!
185446,66596,2012-07-02,5,"Where have I been?  I can't believe I'm reviewer #332!  Better late than never, especially when it comes to such a tasty salad.  Made as directed, and it's perfection.  Thanks, Kittencal.  This will be made weekly from now on."
251626,66596,2012-07-09,5,Just perfect.
333017,66596,2015-04-12,4,Cut the oil back to 2/3 cup ...let onion sit for 2 hours in oil and spices ...sprinkled salt on the tomatoes to let them drain ...did not use the romaine lettuce or green pepper (just a preference).  My family enjoyed this recipe
1581225,66596,2016-11-08,5,"Good ol kittencal, her recipes are top notch. This one is no exception. A great salad. I love feta!"
128473,176615,2010-06-16,5,"What a super recipe Sharon.  It was quick and easy to make with incredible results.  I used this syrup to make recipe #244612, it was perfect in it.  I also served it with strawberries, cantaloupes and blueberries, what a lovely treat it made.  I can't wait to try this on my favorite buttermilk waffles.  Thank you for sharing. :)  Made for Herb of the Month: Tarragon"
29014,53878,2003-03-17,5,"I made these for an appetizer party and not a one was left over!  I assembled them ahead of time and just baked at the party - so easy!  Didn't change anything although we did have a conversation about what else could be added (chopped olives, green onions, etc.) just for fun, because they were great as posted.  Will be making these again (and I LOVE the name!)."
26512,53878,2003-12-26,4,These were great little appetizers! I added green onion to some and black olives to the rest. These disappeared quickly! Thanks!
55729,53878,2004-01-04,4,"I made a half batch to use up some stuff I had in the house, and part of the cream cheese was chive flavored. So easy! Every one was devoured the night I made them (we had a huge spread for just the 4 of us, so this was the *only* item that was finished) and have gotten numerous requests since."
149363,53878,2004-09-27,5,"MMmmmm...these were great, and so fast to make. I was determined to get a photo, but they went too fast. I served these with blue cheese dressing for a dip and they were great!
Thanks for sharing."
158086,53878,2004-10-11,5,This will be a staple at all of our gatherings from now on..very easy and tasty...
101823,53878,2005-07-30,5,"I chopped my pepperoni in my mini food processor and then added the cream cheese.  This made prep so easy.  Everyone loved these.  I offered them on a simple appetizer buffet and pepperoni is a favorite with kids and adults, alike.  Adding cream cheese and buttery pastry to the pepperoni makes these tops.  Thanks for a recipe that everyone enjoys."
135887,53878,2005-12-04,5,Very good and easy.  I made mine ahead of time and placed them on a cookie sheet in the refrigerator until a few minutes before I wanted to serve them.  I also sprinkiled pizza seasoning on them before baking (comes in a grinder by McCormick).  This is a keeper.
230557,53878,2005-12-21,4,Easy to make.  I couldn't manage to figure out how to make 3 triangle out of the crescent dough so just put two seams together to make a square and cut that in 4ths.  Also made some using wonton wrappers.  Dh and kids liked them.
35526,53878,2006-01-14,5,"These were great!  I never figured out eexactly how I wanted to roll them up so I ended up making them liik like a crescent roll, only filled with the yummy mixture.  I am thinking of all kinds of variations, pepperoni and green onion I thing would be very good.  "
199020,53878,2006-01-14,5,"These make great appetizers, and they are very quick and simple to make. They would also be good with other pizza ingredients, like mushrooms, sausage, peppers, etc.  We dipped them in pizza sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!"
286851,53878,2006-02-05,5,"This recipe was as good as others reviewed. It is a bit time consuming (cutting the cresent rolls into triangles and rolling them up), but the recipe turned out well and was very popular at our Super Bowl party. The recipe did not state exactly what size package of pepperoni to use--I used about 1/2 to 2/3 of an 8 oz. package, and this seemed to work well. As others have stated in their reviews, this recipe lends itself well to personal preferences and adaptations. It is a recipe I will make again for future events."
55578,53878,2006-02-06,5,"The whole family loved it. I bought extra large crescents, but I'm not sure it's needed.  I found the smaller the amount of dough used the nicer the taste.  I used chopped black olives, green onions and smoked sausage (as I didn't have pepperoni, which I think would have been fantastic).  I was a big hit watching the Super Bowl!!"
59163,53878,2006-02-09,5,I made this for Super Bowl Sunday.  I used my food processor to chop the pepperoni and it worked great.  Also used turkey pepperoni.  I also heated marinara and served it on the side.  It was a huge hit!
173314,53878,2006-09-05,5,easy and delicious! May try other combinations such as cheddar cheese and jalapenos or cream cheese with ham and green onion.
131021,53878,2006-10-11,5,This was fabulous. We added some garlic powder and a little italian seasoning. I can't wait to try it with leftovers from the next pizza night. I made some of them a little bigger and they turned out great too.
222055,53878,2006-10-31,5,Deeeeelicious!!! Made them as a treat for dh and he loved them! Can't wait to make them for the next family gathering! Thank You Miss Ashley!!!
355637,53878,2007-01-01,3,"I made these for a New Years party yesterday and while they were okay, I am not sure they are worth a five star rating. I dipped them in pizza sauce too... my husband ate them all, but he'll eat anything!! Sorry!"
269331,53878,2007-02-12,5,"I brought these to a Super Bowl party and everybody loved them.  I added chopped green onion to the cream cheese mixtureâ€¦ YUMM!  It was a little tricky making the balls, but well worth it."
329638,53878,2007-02-16,5,"I have made these 4 times for four different social gatherings, and each time everyone is begging for the recipe.  Super easy to make in the food processor, and I usually use hot and spicy pepperoni and add in a little green onion and pizza seasoning to kick it up a bit.  Very good recipe!"
125640,53878,2007-08-03,4,"The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, and they were just okay. This morning I wanted something quick and easy for brunch, so I tried a half batch of this with Canadian bacon instead of pepperoni. I also added 1/4 tsp each Italian seasoning and garlic. To make it super easy I just rolled the filling up in the cresent rolls. Turned out great; didn't even need a dipping sauce this time. Thanks for sharing."
58836,53878,2007-08-21,4,These were pretty good.  I think I might have had a bigger package of pepperoni because it overpowered the cream cheese.  All in all they were gone pretty fast.  Thanks
142559,53878,2007-10-25,5,"WOWOWOWOWOWOW!!!!  These are phenomenal! I was skeptic at first, but these are soooooooooo good!  I am taking these to a camping trip this weekend.  I would definitely add some green onion next time - and trust me, there will be MANY more next times! These are a KEEPER!  Thanks for posting!!"
140132,53878,2007-12-31,5,yum yum   very good
377581,53878,2008-01-15,3,"These came together quickly and easily. I just didn't really care for the taste. I thought the filling could have used more flavor. If I try these again in the future, I will add marinara or something spicy. Thanks for posting."
97579,53878,2008-03-02,5,I made these last night for a euchre party and they were a hit.  I love how easy and quick they were to make.  Thanks!
229524,53878,2008-03-16,5,"These are FANTASTIC :)  So easy and sooooooo tasty.  I did add fresh garlic and green onions to my mix , as some others had suggested. I then just tore off pieces of the rolls and wrapped them around the filling.  Baked for 19 minutes as directed on the can.  They came out nice and brown.  Thanks so much Ashley for sharing such a GREAT recipe."
146486,53878,2008-04-30,5,These are so addicting and so tasty!  Everyone loved them and kept asing what was in them.  We all got a kick out of the name too.  Thanks for this quick and easy treat!
80998,53878,2008-12-06,5,Very easy to make and enjoyed by all at a Christmas party last night.  Good warm or cold.
353131,53878,2009-02-13,5,"Made these last night to sample. Wanted to make sure they would be okay if served at room temp. We are taking these to a valentines party. Three kids,Dh and I thought they were great hot out of the oven and even after sitting out for half an hour they were still amazing. Will definitely make these often.. I went by the other reviews and added Italian seasoning. I also used hormel naturals pepperoni that has no nitrates or nitrites. These are so good!"
318235,53878,2009-07-13,5,"Easy and delicious. Couldn't ask for anything more, and they were eaten up very quickly at our 4th of July bbq. In the future I will probably mince the pepperoni in a food processor and then add the cream cheese at room temperature and mix to make the process even easier. Thanks again!"
64642,53878,2009-12-13,4,Very flavorful and quite easy to assemble.  Thanks for posting Ashley.
373817,53878,2009-12-15,5,This will be my go-to recipe for all parties! These are SO yummy!!
768828,53878,2013-02-02,5,"These were very good, although mine weren't exactly attractive.  I may use the whole crescent triangle next time - just make them bigger.  I did make Kittencal's pizza sauce  for dipping.  Yummy."
27643,77585,2004-02-18,5,"We had this soup at an Olive Garden when we were in Michigan last year. And, yes, it was this soup! Tasted just like it! This will be a staple in our kitchen! Thanks for the recipe!"
252816,77585,2005-11-01,5,This soup is wonderful.I made no changes.It will be a regular at my house..Thank U for this recipe....
49304,77585,2005-11-02,5,Yummy Minestrone soup great on a cold day. I made this just like the recipe stated using my home canned green beans and fresh spinach out of the garden. For the pasta I used orzo we love it in Minestrone soup. Served it with lots of Parmesan Cheese & hot rolls. Thank you for this tasty recipe.
8688,77585,2006-01-12,5,"Excellent recipe, Suzy! It's so nice because I generally have all these ingredients in my pantry and ready to go!  Easy to follow directions for a delicious, hot and satisfying supper!  Thanks for sharing, Suzy!"
140806,77585,2006-01-15,5,Wow! I never have to go to Olive Garden again. This soup required quite a bit of prep work but it was well worth it. I was a little more generous with the celery and green beans.  I added a splash of red wine...which I think I will leave out next time. Dh walked in the door from work and had to walk out and come back in because he said  it smelled so good. Served with fresh rosemary bread and red wine. Yum!
262312,77585,2007-02-02,5,"Awesome soup!  I served with grilled cheeses!  I used only 2 cans of beans, and DH said he wished I hadn't cut back, he wanted more!  I'll follow the recipe exactly next time!  Can't wait to make this again!  Thanks for the keeper!!"
185446,77585,2007-08-27,4,"Followed other reviewers's tips about adding more vegetable broth in lieu of the water, adding a bit of tomato sauce, undrained tomatoes,some red wine and less beans.  All good ideas--soups are meant to be individually tweaked, and I loved the easy-to-make end product.  Thanks, Suzy!"
47907,77585,2007-11-05,5,This soup is great!  I love Olive Garden's and this recipe is very close.  I made as posted but only used 3 cans total of beans.  Thanks for posting!
125640,77585,2008-01-26,4,"I've never had this at Olive Garden so can't compare to theirs, but this is a very nice soup. I did add 1/4 cup red wine after step 2 and gave it about 5 minutes to cook before going on to step 3. This is a very thick soup, a bit like a stew. Tasty and easy to make. I have a minestrone recipe that DH and I like better, but this is quite a bit different and I think I will make this one again. Thanks for sharing."
121185,77585,2008-02-04,4,"I love, love, love O.G.'s minestrone soup - and while this was a very good soup, it wasn't exactly like O.G.  But - still - very - very - good! :)"
377581,77585,2008-03-11,5,Easy and everyone liked it. I put in an extra clove of garlic and tsp basil. It was so good. Thank you.
187373,77585,2008-12-18,4,"Good soup.  Don't know how it compares to Olive Garden, but is a good way to get in some veggies.  I used beef broth, left out the kidney beans since I didn't have any and added about 1/2 cup of red wine.  Only made a half recipe which gave us at least 5 generous servings.  Yum!"
439797,77585,2009-10-30,5,"I changed this up a bit - just based on what was in the house.  No zucchini, added green pepper instead.  Also added 1 lb spicy sausage because my family really likes their meat!"
135887,77585,2009-11-16,4,"This went together nicely.  I did do a couple things differently.  I added the carrots with the rest of the veggies.  I did not drain my tomatoes (not sure why you would).  I added 1 cup of red wine and, finally, I used chicken broth.  Great soup - makes a lot more than 8 servings."
653438,77585,2009-12-03,5,"I made this for lunch the other day for DH and I.  I followed the directions to a a ""t"" only cut the recipe in half.  Delicious!  This will be a regular in our house.  Thank you for a wonderful soup."
140132,77585,2009-12-29,5,Very hearty soup.  I have not tried OG's but this is wonderful.  Thank you for posting.
637486,77585,2010-01-04,5,"I have never had the Minestrone soup at Olive Garden, but this was quite tasty!  I thought there was a really good balance of flavors.  The only changes I made was that I cut down on the beans and used only 1 can of kidney beans.  I also added a splash of red wine as some of the others suggested."
37779,77585,2010-02-22,4,"I am so into soups and this is a good one loaded with lots of healthy veggies. Doesn't taste quite like our Olive Garden's Minestrone. But, nonetheless, was filling, hearty and sustaining. Served with a big chunk of hot crusty garlic bread. Thanks."
158086,77585,2010-04-07,5,What an easy delish soup this is!  It makes a nice big batch with very little effort...the only thing I changed was I cooked the pasta separate before I added it....
1133190,77585,2010-06-25,5,This was very good!  My husband loved it and he doesn't even like Minestrone soup usually.  I'm sure I'll be making this again and again. I didn't try adding red wine this time but will be sure to next time!
126440,77585,2010-11-15,5,"I made half a recipe as written minus the zucchini. Wonderful soup for a cold, snowy day we are having.  Served with Recipe #13584 toasted in the oven."
203111,77585,2011-04-11,5,"This has become one of my favorite soups.  Love it!  Have never had the Olive Garden minestrone, so I can't compare, and I did make a few changes to this recipe.  Did not drain the tomatoes, used chicken Better Than Bullion rather than veg broth, did not add wine or pasta."
937635,77585,2011-12-28,5,"This was great, but I was a little bummed when I read the ingredient list on the can of Swanson's veg broth after pouring it in and realized there's MSG and high fructose corn syrup in it. I am usually so anal about avoiding those two things. Oh well. The soup is good. Next time I'll make it with different veggie stock and try adding red wine. Tasted like Olive Garden, but I think wine would give it more nice depth like others suggested. Thanks!"
198154,77585,2012-08-13,5,"DD was less than thrilled with the idea of eating a soup filled with beans and spinach.  But she was more than willing to give it a try once she got a whiff of it cooking.  ""That smells sooooo good!""  Well I guess it didn't disappoint.  Everyone in my family gave it 4 or 5 stars, which is excellent coming from this crew.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe."
540346,77585,2013-03-07,5,This soup is delicious and easy to make.  I made a few changes because I didn't have some of the ingredients--such as subbing okra for green beans--but I left it mostly the same.  I am looking forward to eating it for lunch tomorrow.
839492,77585,2014-03-25,4,"I made this with half the amount of canned beans, using all black beans ( that&#039;s all I had), I think the full amount of beans directed would be way too many. I also added to the recipe 1/2 small head of sliced cabbage, frozen baby lima beans in place of green beans ( again, that&#039;s what I had), 1/2c. Dry white wine &amp; 2T balsamic vinegar, doubled the tomatoes since it seemed to need more  at the end. The wine really made the dish, definitely complimented the flavors. Topped with parmesan cheese &amp; added some cooked spinach feta chicken sausage to half (which I froze for a later date, as this does make a lot ). So good, thanks for an inspirational soup recipe!"
1179225,77585,2016-01-31,0,"Mmmmm....total keeper recipe! Just the right amount of seasoning and broth. Loved it! As usual I make some adjustments based on what I have on hand and our preferences my changes were to halve the amount of beans, skip the pasta and substitute finely chopped cabbage in place of the spinach. Delicious and even better the next day. Thanks so much for posting this recipe."
1072593,77585,2017-12-01,5,Good stuff! Basically brought back someone sick back from the dead.
135887,117317,2005-10-28,5,Excellent cookie!  I will alternate this recipe with the one I normally use that calls for vanilla pudding mix.  Both recipes produce a crisp chewy cookie.  I like the almond flavor.
185446,117317,2006-04-28,5,"Nice texture and flavor.  Followed Roxy's suggestion to use 2 3/4 C flour, and they turned out just right!  Another winner, Roxy!"
89831,117317,2006-05-05,5,"Add one one more 5 star!No wonder there are so many great reviews on this cookie recipe, these are simply wonderful! they have it all...perfect texture and taste, great recipe Rox! thanks for sharing...Kitten:) "
255338,117317,2006-05-23,4,Very good looking cookies.
119466,117317,2006-05-31,5,"Wonderful cookies--great flavor and texture, and the almond extract adds a nice touch. The only change I really made in the ingredients was using unbleached flour, as I don't usually buy bleached. I chilled the dough overnight before baking and lined the baking sheets with parchment. I doubled the recipe to have plenty for a school function; using a level tablespoon-size cookie scoop, I ended up with about 8 1/2 dozen. Great recipe--thanks for sharing it! "
140806,117317,2006-07-02,5,Yummy! Words cannot express how excited I am about this recipe. The almond adds that little special something. The baking time was perfect. I added the extra flour to make my cookies puffy and thick. 10 stars all the way!!!
124249,117317,2006-08-11,5,"I think this is the richest tasting chocolate chip cookie I have had so far. They are soft and delicious. They stayed soft for several days. My chocolate chip cookie loving husband thanks you. I made some big ones to use as the base for recipe #57209.

Thanks Roxygirl in Colorado.

Bullwinkle."
222564,117317,2006-08-15,5,"Excellent, crunchy but chewy cookie, with elegant addition of almond flavor! I did use all 2 3/4 cup of flour but will try next time with the original 2 1/2 cup, just to see the difference. We do like our cookies on the crunchy side."
47559,117317,2006-10-29,5,Outstanding.  Love the almond flavoring.  These won't last long around here.
56087,117317,2006-10-30,5,"These are really amazingly good CC cookies.  I made as stated, didn't change a thing. I actually got a little over 4 doz. 2 1/2 inch cookies. Recipe was right on.  I also used the extra 1/4 cup flour. I then asked my biggest critic ( 7 year old Grandson) and he said, ""they are crunchy on the outside, but chewy in the middle"", kinda blew me away.  BUT THAT is the kind of CC cookie I've been looking for.  Hubby downed 5 of them faster then they could cool.  Will add this to my favorites book.  Thank you for sharing."
52125,117317,2006-12-30,5,"These chocolate chip cookies are some of the best I ever tried. My DH and DS ate enough of them, as I only got a couple, lol, guess I will have to make them again. Thanks Roxygirl in Colorado...."
50969,117317,2007-02-06,4,"First thing I must say,I wish I had tried this cookie recipe alot
sooner :).I followed the recipe as written except I had to use magarine,I even added the extra flour as written in the note.The only chocolate chips I had were mini semi sweet and that seemed to work just fine.I even used a measuring cup as you suggested in step 5.To keep the cup from sticking to the dough,I dipped the bottom into a little bit of sugar.My oven runs a little hot,So I only needed to bake them for 8 minutes after the first batch.My SO and I really liked the taste of these cookies.I think it was the almond extract that ""something special"". This will be made again,thank you for posting.
""Keep Smiling:)"""
137911,117317,2007-03-01,5,A big hit here in our house!  I made a batch to send to my daughter who's away in college.  The smell of them baking was torture so we had to sample a few.  Love the almond extract addition.
248023,117317,2007-07-02,4,"Great, easy to prepare chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I couldn't really tell the difference in taste from the addition of the almond extract but it certainly didn't didn't hurt the taste of this thick, extra chocolately cookie.  I pressed one batch of my cookies down and I didn't like the texture of those cookies as much as the ones that were free form.  They turned out much more crunchy if you press them out and I personally liked the chewier cookies better.  The cookie batter was very tasty in itself.  My BF loves tons of chips in his cookies so I purposely separated enough to dough to bake a few cookies without the chips in it for a treat for myself...and I loved them!!!  Thanks for sharing!"
168462,117317,2007-11-11,5,These were easy to make and the kids loved them. Thanks for the recipe
386849,117317,2008-01-07,5,"This is definitely a keeper- thanks, Roxygirl!"
264017,117317,2008-02-07,5,"Absolutely 5+ stars. I'm always on the search for the elusive ""best"" chocolate chip cookie recipe and this one is running in first place right now. That little bit of almond extract makes such a huge difference! Also, don't skimp on the 2 cups of chocolate chips. It may seem like a lot, but every morsel adds to the greatness of this cookie. Thanks Roxygirl!"
324621,117317,2008-04-01,4,"These were good, but I didn't think they were really anything special. They baked up pretty flat and even when they weren't done yet in the center the edges were brown. So I either had to take them out still too soft in the center (and I usually do take my cookies out a bit early so they don't brown or get crisp at all) or let them bake through and be crispy. Dough tasted very good! The baked results just weren't my ""type"" of cookie."
774665,117317,2008-04-14,5,I am not a big fan of chocolate chip cookies but I make an exception for this cookie! It's by far the best I've had and I love that the extra flour helps them to stay nice and fat. I ended up putting 1 1/2 cups chips and a cup of walnuts because we love nuts and we don't like too much chocolate. They were perfect. I cooked them for 12 minutes--perfection!
64583,117317,2008-08-05,5,"Very good cookies!  I love the texture, the taste and the fact that they don't spread out into a flat and thin cookie.  I'm not overly fond of almond flavor, so I put just slightly less than the amount of almond extract called for.  It has such a faint almond taste but I just love it!  Thanks for posting!"
218535,117317,2009-01-02,5,I have to admit that I am torn between this recipe and Recipe #20408. They are both delicious for different reasons.
394077,117317,2009-03-27,3,"With all of these wonderful reviews,  I decided to try this recipe.  I added the extra flour as suggested and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My cookies came out thick and cakey.  They were no where crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  Sigh.  Maybe,  I will try it again and skip the 1/4 cup of xtra flour and see if that will help."
172369,117317,2009-07-27,5,"Thank you for a great recipe. I made as directed except I doubled the recipe, I came up with over 100 cookies, not real big, but just right. I will make this again."
1133190,117317,2009-09-28,5,I made a few adjustments and I think these might be my favorite cookies yet.  Thanks!!
632249,117317,2009-10-20,4,"This is a very good cookie but the kids didn't care for the almond flavouring. So, the next time I will just use vanilla and maybe a bit less sugar as they are very sweet. Thx Roxy!"
37449,117317,2009-11-17,5,I enjoyed these cookies! I will be giving some of them as gifts. Thanks Roxy!
15521,117317,2011-02-22,5,"Delicious cookie!  They were crispy enough for my husband, who likes crispy cookies - (crisp on the edges and the bottom) and soft enough for those of us who like our cookies chewy!  I also liked that they weren't greasy at all.  This reminds me of another recipe I like that uses vanilla pudding, but often I am out of pudding and can't make them.  These will definitely be enjoyed many times over!  I did chill the dough for about 30 minutes but don't think I needed to.  Mine did not spread much at all."
176615,117317,2011-10-02,5,"Yummy cookies! I used all butter, no other changes. Love the addition of almond extract. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!"
187373,117317,2012-09-04,4,"Delicious!  I used the extra flour and they turned out great, didn't get flat.  Next time, would add some nuts, but didn't have any handy this time."
140132,117317,2012-10-01,5,We made these for DD's sleep over and they were so good.  The almond extract in these takes them over the top.  I loved it and so did the girls.  Thank you for sharing with us.
529278,117317,2013-11-28,5,Yumm!!  Loved the almond and vanilla combo :)
350750,117317,2014-01-04,5,"Yummy!  These were so good and full of chocolate chips. We took what was left, after taste testing, to a gathering for New Year&#039;s Eve and they were liked by the cousins.  I don&#039;t need to look for another chocolate chip cookie anymore as these were great, thank you!"
35526,74301,2005-03-30,5,"While pimping this I realized I never reviewed, ooops!!  Great little Appy or snack.  We serve at every single party we have had in the last 2 years.  Salsa, sour cream and quacamole on the side.  FANTASTIC!!"
51011,74301,2005-03-31,5,YUM!!! I think that one of the most important things is to pre-cook the wantons in the pan- it makes it crispy and good.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!
59780,74301,2004-09-06,5,"I borrowed this great supper idea from a ""what's for supper"" thread and boy am I glad I did!!! Everyone in the family loved these and they were so simple to whip up. I almost always have Tish's All Purpose Ground Meat Mix recipe#31008 in the freezer and I will add this to my list of quick meals to make with it. I just made a double batch of homemade taco seasoning (recipe#45808)and used 1 Tbsp of that instead of a package. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
"
101823,74301,2004-11-15,5,"Very good and very easy.  Hubby loved these as part of a light supper.  I used my homemade salsa, which kicked up the heat a bit.  But, we like things that way.  :)  I have a similar recipe posted that uses sausage.  This is by far the winner."
68884,74301,2004-11-23,5,"Wonderful, easy, delicious. Chose as Pick A Chef Nov. '04. The only change I made was to add onions when browning the beef. Mine were done in 7 min exactly. DH topped with more salsa; I topped mine with Mexican Fiesta Dip #102835, which is like a kicked-up sour cream. These were crunchy & excellent. Thanks, Bekah!  "
119466,74301,2005-01-09,5,"Made these over the holidays & will definitely be making them again.  A fun, quick recipe & they disappeared in a flash! Thanks for posting it Bekah!"
189616,74301,2005-05-01,5,"Fantastic! The least messy taco we've ever eaten. Alot of flavor in two bites.
Thank you Bekah!"
146047,74301,2005-05-11,5,"Bekah,these are terrific! I love the idea, and am grateful to you for posting it. I made a ""Greek"" version with hummus as the ""sauce"", turkey italian sausage sauteed with garlic and oregano as the topping, and feta as the cheese. Tasty!"
103876,74301,2005-07-09,4,I made these as a quick appetizer.  They were easy to put together and everyone really enjoyed them.  I think the kids ate about 5 each!
98919,74301,2005-09-10,5,"Made these for my grandkids but they wouldn't even try them...oh well...more for me!!  I made 1/2 the way the recipe called for and 1/2 that was just plain old hamburger with minced onion and seasonings added, thinking the kids would eat them better this way.  I loved the plain ones as much as the regular made ones.  Thanks for sharing!!  "
50969,74301,2005-12-23,4,"these are really very good.i didn't know if i should have sprayed the muffin tin before putting in the wonton wrappers,so i sprayed it.i had to bake them just a little longer than stated.( i think my oven is a little off)i asked my son if he liked them,and i got something like a MMMM!!! but i can't be sure his mouth was full,so i'm assuming that was a good thing.thank you for posting."
173314,74301,2006-01-04,4,"Similar concept to a recipe I have posted, but mine is chicken fajita and instead of wontons I just use tostito scoops....try it!  Scoops ( a bagged chip ) makes it real easy."
158086,74301,2006-03-28,5,I too made these for mexican night and they were the star of the menu...I am going to make them again for euchre next month
59163,74301,2006-08-05,5,I have made these twice now and they have been devoured both times.  So easy to make and I love using the wonton wrapper.  They make a pretty presentation. I am going to experiment next time with different fillings such as chicken or seafood.
68960,74301,2006-11-02,5,These are great. Enjoyed by all. I'm going to make a second batch this morning which I'll cook first then flash freeze on a cookie sheet and package up for the freezer.  Thanks for posting!
286851,74301,2006-12-31,5,"Made as directed. Simple, easy recipe that I made for a family get together. A big hit. Served with extra salsa and sour cream on the side. Will definitely make again, either as an appetizer or a quick meal. Yummy!"
91392,74301,2007-01-13,4,"Easy, fast and cute to do.  The wonton wrappers get a bit hard, otherwise, I loved the idea."
174991,74301,2007-01-31,5,"I made this as one of a few appetizers.  They looked good in the pan but I couldn't get them out of the pan.  I had to trash all of them.  I may try them again but this time I will oil the pan. UPDATE Jan.28,2007 made these again, this time oiling the tins, and they came out fine.  I'll be making these again."
185285,74301,2007-08-21,5,"DH loves these little guys, not only are they great for get-togethers, but they are a quick and tasty way to use up leftover taco meat when it's just DH and I. Guys have fun eating them b/c they get manly-man tacos without all the mess.  A great superbowl party food."
400420,74301,2007-09-23,5,"I served these last night along with a variety of other appetizers at a little get toghter and these were a HUGE hit - the hands down favorite among my guests.  I made just as directed, except I used a little (about 4 oz) of ground pork mixed in with the 1 lb of ground beef.  This made 48 tacos and there was still some of the meat mixture (enough to make another 4 or 5 tacos) left over.  I'm glad it made so much, because there were only about 10 left at the end of the night.  My DD said I have to make these instead of regular tacos from now on.  I'll definitely be serving these as a meal to my family in the future.  Thank you!"
140132,74301,2007-11-05,5,"How fun are these!  I printed this recipe out for an appie night but never got around to making them, so the other night I made them for supper.  We loved them!  My family couldn't get enough....LOL.  I will be making these often especially with the holidays coming up, I plan on taking them to different parties we go to....thanks so much....Stephanie"
218535,74301,2008-01-16,5,Easy appetizer. A keeper.
439797,74301,2008-02-29,5,A fun snack!  Kids loved them.
229850,74301,2008-03-23,5,"These were delicious and easy ! Took them to Easter and received raves! I did precook the wrappers the nite before, then in the morning I made meat mixture, placed them on a cookie sheet, added the cheese and then transported them and heated them there. Then put them out with the salsa, sour cream, etc. for everyone to garnish their own. How simple and easy ! Not a one left!
Thankyou!"
278113,74301,2008-09-08,4,"These were great and went over well with guests. Ours never got really crispy on the bottom, but they were tasty!"
353131,74301,2008-10-26,5,"Made these yesterday. I had no trouble getting the wontons in muffin tins. Just kinda brought the four corners together,stuck them in the tins and then opened them back up.I too, baked mine for a few minutes before I put the filling in.  What a great little appetizer(or lunch for kids)My DS(9) ate about 10 of them!! I will definitely make again!!!"
97579,74301,2010-01-18,5,These were perfect for my card party!  I also loved adding the salsa to the meat..I will be doing that from now on when I make regular tacos.  Thanks!
198154,74301,2015-02-05,4,"We have both meat eaters and vegetarians in our house. So I made these with veggie grounds, just like I do when we have regular tacos.  I also used a Mexican blend for the cheese.  They were easy to grab and go for a quick dinner on the run."
49304,99709,2004-09-14,5,"Great recipe, We love Tilapia I have a couple of recipes that I use and will add this one to make often. Dh really liked it. It doesn't mention what to do with the olive oil,So I didn't use it. I used release foil I did spray it with non-stick spray, I also sprayed the coating on the fish with pam this makes it stick really good therefore you can use more of the coating mix. The baking time is about right. We really enjoyed this fish and I will be making it again, Thank you."
64203,99709,2004-09-27,5,"This is soooooo delicious! We love Tilapia at our house but don't have a lot of recipes for it, so I was thrilled to find this one. It really is an easy recipe and has a delicious flavor! I only had to bake mine for 10 minutes (6 on one side, 4 on the next), but our fillets were pretty thin. Thanks for sharing this recipe! We'll be making this time and time again."
88099,99709,2004-10-10,3,"Made this last night with orange roughy.  We like spicy food, but these spices were very strong and over powered the taste of the fish.  "
74652,99709,2004-10-21,4,Made this for supper with some wild rice and it was very good!  I did not use the Italian Seasoning because I just for some reason didn't thing it complimented the other spices.  Really enjoyed this.  Thanks
42720,99709,2005-04-03,5,"Ladypit, this recipe was a winner for us!  Wow! We have been trying to add more fish to our diet and dh and I have discovered we love Tilapia.  As someone else mentioned it doesn't have the strong ""fishy"" taste.  I also like the fact that Tilapia fillets are thin and cook quickly.  The spice combination in this recipe is very good and they blend well with the fish.  I did not add the olive oil to the bread crumbs but instead brushed it on the fillets and it worked great to adhere the breadcrumbs to the fish.  I will definitely be serving this dish  often and I'm taking someone else's advice and mixing up a large batch of this seasoning mix to have ready to go.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! :)
"
37779,99709,2005-05-12,5,I like this recipe for many reasons. It is very easy to make which is always important to me. The spices blended well for great flavor but no burning mouth. Husband and family thought is was tasty and it's just darn healthy. Thanks ladypit.
46660,99709,2005-06-28,5,"This was delicious! We all loved it!  I tend to overcook fish, but this turned out perfect!  I was amazed at how well the coating stuck to the fish.  I will be keeping this recipe around!  Thanks!"
133174,99709,2005-11-14,5,"The fish had a nice crispy crust without added fat.  I mixed up the spice mix and used cornflake crumbs instead of the breadcrumbs, omitted the green onions and after washing and drying the fillets, misted them lightly with olive oil prior to pressing into the crumb mixture.  The fish held the crumb mixture nicely and after DH's first bite he proclaimed it delicious.  Lemon wedges were served on the side."
169969,99709,2005-11-16,5,"I loved the crispy crust on the tilapia! The flavors were so good, and the meal was so low in calories and fat! This is a winner in our house! "
173579,99709,2006-05-01,5,I used this recipe on some snapper that we caught in Florida.  It was fantastic!  My family thought it was the best they had ever had.  Very yummy.  Thanks for posting.
52262,99709,2006-05-28,5,"I'm always looking for new fish recipes and this one is a keeper.  The flavor of all of the spices combined made the tilapia taste very good.  I rubbed the spices on with the reserved spices.  Then I sprayed a little olive oil on the fish.  Next I dredged the fish in the bread crumb mixture.  After the fish was on my non-stick foil, I sprayed the fish with the olive oil again.  I ended up with a lot of left over bread crumb mixture when I doubled the recipe, but the spice amount on the fish was more than enough."
389431,99709,2007-02-10,5,"My DH just loved this (I'm not much of a fish lover myself)!  We used basa instead of tilapia because it was on sale, and it still turned out wonderfully!  I will be using this recipe again!  Thanks so much!"
294000,99709,2007-02-13,5,"We really enjoyed this!  Very easy to make and quick.  I served it with Bob Greene's Pepper and Olive Tomato Sauce, which I posted... ""Recipe #75610"".  Even my toddler ate it.  Wow, a 2-year-old eating fish.  Now that's a good recipe."
316717,99709,2007-02-23,4,this was really good. never sure what type of salt to use when recipe isn't specific..but i used kosher for this and it turned out fine.
355637,99709,2007-03-09,5,"I do love Fish Fridays when I make a meal like this!! This is SO good! The only thing I didn't do is add dry mustard powder, as I didn't have any. Tasty!!"
33159,99709,2007-04-15,5,"Yummy!!  I left out the green onions as a personal preference but followed the recipe other than that.  The fish is wonderful, the seasoning is perfect!  Because my hubby doesn't like fish, I did a boneless, skinless chicken breast for him with the same method - he really enjoyed that, too."
185926,99709,2007-05-01,2,Unfortunately my fish came out soggy.  Perhaps it was something I did wrong.
4470,99709,2007-05-28,5,"Very easy tasty recipe - I used Panko crumbs and Basa fish, None of the herbs/spices overpower each other but they all come together to give a subtle flavor to the fish. I served the fish with Lemon Asparagus, new carrots & sweet potatoe oven fries - Wonderful dinner Thanks ladypit for a lovely dinner"
286851,99709,2007-07-04,4,"Fixed this last night, and my family really enjoyed it. It did have a lot of spice, but it is still kid-friendly, I believe. It was very easy to make and I had most of the long list of condiments already in my cabinets. Made no changes except that I didn't have any italian seasoning, so it was left out. The recipe is easy to make, and the cooking times were perfect for my oven. Will definitely make again--thanks for sharing!"
125640,99709,2007-08-14,3,"This was the first time I've ever made fish and it was pretty good. I think it's a great recipe for those that don't really care for fish, but are trying to eat more of it as the tilapia is very mild and the flavor of the spices come through rather strongly so it doesn't taste fishy. DH thought the spices overpowered the flavor of the fish a bit much and that there were too many different spices competing with each other, so I'll probably only put half of the spice mix on a couple of filets for him next time. Thanks for sharing."
265954,99709,2007-09-25,5,"Excellent tilapia dish.  I cooked for about 3 more minutes that was recommended.  The fish came out flaky and light.  Also, I had no dry mustard, so I just added honey dijon straight from the jar when I mixed in the olive oil.  Last, I did not use cumin or green onions, and this dish scored big with my family, nonetheless.  Thanks for posting!"
226863,99709,2007-10-18,5,"Excellent recipe!  I wanted more than one serving!  Next time I will reduce the amount of salt by half...maybe my breadcrumbs were too salty, but it was a little salty for me.  I used Morton Lite Salt, and it was still too salty for me.  The green onions in the breadcrumb mixture is wonderful. All the other spices seemed perfect.  I am on a diet, but this would be wonderful dipped into tartar sauce or with a ranch/dijon dip. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
280271,99709,2007-12-16,5,"DH and I have been trying to eat cleaner. (less fat and sugar). This hit the spot. I really was a bit worried about all the spices, but it is ""Baked Tilapia with LOTS of Spice"".
We were pleasantly surprise that the spices didn't take away from the flavor of the fish. I did serve it with a little (mayo, ketsup and a touch of horseradish mixture on the side) This is a keeper. Thanks, ladypit for posting this deliicous dish."
207176,99709,2008-02-27,4,"I enjoyed preparing this.  I used flounder.  We all had different reviews.  For me it was a 3 (it was only OK), for my older son and DH it was a 4 (pretty good) and for my picky son, well, he didn't like it."
187373,99709,2008-07-12,5,"Oops, accidentally wrote my review under my husband's account!  Delicious fish!"
240552,99709,2008-08-18,5,Amazingly easy and delicious! I made my own breadcrumbs with whole wheat bread.  I served this with some cheesy brown rice and green beans for a delicious healthy dinner.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
229524,99709,2009-04-14,5,Easy and delicious.  Nothing else really needs to be said about this recipe.
928301,99709,2009-06-30,5,my family loved it
914720,99709,2010-01-24,5,"This was great!  I don't really like fish, but I had seconds of this, and DH and DS loved it.  It had a great flavor, but wasn't at all ""spicy"".  The breadcrumbs gave a great texture.  Served with baked sweet potatoes and spaghetti squash.  Thanks for posting!"
135887,99709,2010-03-12,5,We really loved this.  I used another reviewer's tip and brushed the olive oil onto the fish after the seasonings were on and then dredged in the crumbs.  I used Panko crumbs.  The cook time was right on.  We thought the spice combination was perfect.  I am going to try it on chicken.
8629,99709,2010-06-13,4,Very nice. I enjoyed the flavor.   I used Panko brand for the bread crumbs. I needed to use more olive oil in order to get the correct consistency for the bread crumbs to adhere to the fish.  My filets were thin so I did not need to do step 11.
140132,99709,2010-10-23,5,"I made these last night for supper and we loved them.  They have the perfect amount of spices and they baked up so beautifully.  My kids usually cover their fish in tartar sauce, but the sauce hardly got touch last night.  So good, I want to thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe with us.  I will most definatly use this recipe again, it was so good."
126440,99709,2012-07-31,5,Cut the recipe down for three and used 1/2 t. salt.  Cooked in a skillet rather than the oven so was very quick.  Served in thin buns for a sandwich.  Very good.
486718,99709,2013-01-07,5,This was really easy and tasty!  I made exactly as is and the fish came out perfect. Thanks!!
218535,99709,2013-02-17,4,4 stars because it itoo salty. definitely reduce salt.
2549237,99709,2015-02-03,4,"This was a very easy alternative to fried fish.  I had read the reviews prior to cooking this and made one small change.  I completely omitted the salt, as it would be easy to salt at the table if need be.  The taste was phenomenal without salt, so that is how I will make it from now on.  I have a hard time eating fish, as I just don&#039;t normally like the taste of it, but with this recipe I will be able to start rotating it into our diet more often.  Even my 1O, 8 and 4 year old children loved it.  My 8 year old daughter wanted more, but alas there wasn&#039;t any leftover.  Thank you for a great new way to eat fish ladypit!"
439797,35526,2008-12-06,4,had some jam to use up and this was fun to try.  They weren't sweet enough for my family
13796,135350,2005-10-09,5,Very good. Nice and creamy. I used 2 cups of Fat Free Half & Half and it was good! I perked it up with a little dry mustard.
173314,135350,2006-08-31,5,kids loved. I used light velveeta as I was out of cheddar and omitted breadcrumbs (kids preference).  look forward to freezing leftovers and seeing how it tastes next time! thank you
357358,135350,2006-12-10,5,"Comfort food at its best! The only thing I was unsure of was the Buttered Breadcrumbs. I sprinkled on 4C Seasoned Breadcrumbs and that worked very well. Used white pepper instead of black pepper. This recipe is worth the extra effort. Since you must stir the whole time the sauce is cooking, it took me at least 1/2 hour of prep time. I doubled the recipe and took your advice about freezing some in a zip-loc bag. Excellent served with #106715. Thanks for posting."
269331,135350,2007-01-05,5,I had a hankering for some good ole comfort food and this really hit the spot.  I doubled the recipe and added one teaspoon of Colmanâ€™s dry mustard to the white sauce.  I also added sliced kielbasa (I added it to the pasta water the last four minutes while the pasta was cooking just to warm them up).  YUMMMM!
394077,135350,2007-01-10,3,Easy to make and tastes OK.
59163,135350,2009-01-10,5,"Made this (and several other zaar recipes today) to freeze for my sister in-law who has been in the hospital, after having a lung removed.  Very easy to make and delicious of course with the addtion of the cream!  This should hit the spot for comfort food during her recovery.  DH wished that I had made some for him!"
189475,135350,2009-01-19,5,"Great recipe.  I realized how important the 'stir constantly' part of the recipe was...If you don't keep stirring it, it will stick to the pan very quickly. While it may get annoying standing there stirring for 10 minutes, it's worth it because this macaroni and cheese is delicious."
315055,135350,2009-02-04,5,"Phenomenal!  I have tried many recipes trying to make the perfect mac n' cheese, and until trying this one I was always dissappointed.  This is macaroni perfection!  Thanks so much for posting!"
1072593,135350,2009-03-10,5,"At 135 votes and counting, how can you go wrong?  This is very different from my usual egg custard-based mac and cheese.  I found it to be extremely smooth and cheesy and it got raves from my peanut gallery."
226863,135350,2009-04-03,5,"This was very good.  I usually am not a big fan of baked macaroni and cheese, especially when I can get better results on the stovetop in less time.  But this recipe was yummy.  I didn't add the breadcrumbs at the kids request.  Next time I don't think I will cook the flour/cream mix as long.  I also added extra cheese.  DS really liked it.  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag for ""F""."
218535,135350,2009-05-01,4,"We did not like the breadcrumbs. But other than that, this is delicious."
371738,135350,2009-06-23,5,Everyone loved it.  Thanks!
140132,135350,2009-07-11,5,"Very very creamy and cheesy.  This not only tastes great but its a good workout.  My stirring arm got a workout tonight!!!  So worth very turn of the spoon.  This mac and cheese is so creamy and cheesy, perfect to go with my ribs tonight.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us."
173579,135350,2009-09-09,5,This was very good mac and cheese.  Nice creamy texture.  Will make again.  Thanks for posting.
199792,135350,2009-09-21,4,"This was certainly good, very cheesy, yummy goodness. It is very similar to my usual recipe except for the addition of cream. The sauce did seem a bit thick to me so I added a bit more cream. In the end I thought it could have used another half to 1 cup of milk or cream as it was a bit dry. The flavour was great though, the cheese flavour was perfect. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
632249,135350,2009-10-19,5,"Well, I can hardly believe it...finally a homemade mac and cheese that my kids like! I have tried a number of recipes that my husband and I liked just fine, but could never find one that pleased the kids. This recipe did the trick. Both kids ate second helpings! I made this exactly as written, right down to stirring constantly for the whole time (which is a considerable amount of time but soooooo worth it).  Thx to you and Fannie Farmer too!"
653438,135350,2009-10-28,5,"Fixed this the other night when we went up to the cabin to close it up....I cut the recipe in half, added about another 1/4 cup of cream and added some garlic (we love garlic).  This was a delicious and creamy dish and one I definately will make again.  Served with a green salad.   Made for Alphabet Chef Tag 2009."
91392,135350,2009-11-15,5,Super good.  I was surprised because I grew up with Kraft mac and cheese tastes.  I did use good Cheddar and I followed the recipe even though I wondered why I was cooking stirring constantly for 10 minutes.  I wouldn't change a thing.
103876,135350,2009-12-24,5,Very good creamy mac & cheese.  Made for Christmas Eve and my family really enjoyed.  I used fat free half & half for the cream and 2% milk.  I added more milk as I was mixing it together because it just seemed too thick.  I also added a little bit of minced onion and dry mustard as other reviewers suggested.  I would recommend this recipe for good mac & cheese.
44383,135350,2009-11-17,2,"I might have given this a 4 star as it was okay Mac and cheese but I've had better.  But I took an additional star off because the directions clearly state it takes 35 minutes to complete with 15 of that being preparation. Not sure how fast the author moves in her kitchen but it took me a minimum of an hour and that's without letting the flour/milk mixture simmer 10 minutes and cutting short the baking time by 5 minutes in order to have dinner on at a decent but still late time.  I hate it when a recipe mis-states the time it takes to prepare a dish because I only have so much time to get dinner on the table when I get home from work and if the recipe lies to me, then my whole evening is messed up.  Not only that but the taste was rather bland and uninspiring. Much like the macaroni and cheese you get out of the freezer section at the supermarket.  Sorry but not impressed at all."
1133190,135350,2010-01-05,5,"This was my first attempt at homemade mac & cheese and it was a great success thanks to this recipe!  I used a mixture of half & half, whole and skim milk for the cup of cream and milk since thats all I had on hand and it worked out fine.  My husband grew up with mac & cheese and peas so that's how we served it this time as well.  Thanks for posting!"
132383,135350,2010-01-13,5,The best mac and cheese we have had yet.  My husband likes creamy mac n cheese and I like dry mac in cheese...this was the perfect compromise.  He did use 3/4 cup milk instead of 1. Thanks for sharing!
32058,135350,2010-04-05,5,"My SIL made these with 1/2 Fontina, 1/2 cheddar--it was AWESOME!  I'll make for my family!"
1365025,135350,2010-04-14,3,"This was easy enough to make but did not like the flavor, very bland and was floury tasting. Could not taste much cheese flavor. The only thing I didn't use in the recipe was the breadcrumbs. When I use the left overs I will add more cheese. Sorry but I still like the little blue box better."
1269015,135350,2010-07-23,4,"I used 1/2 cup half and half instead of the cream and next time will probably leave it out altogether -- as well as cutting the sauce ingredients (cheese, butter, flour, salt and pepper in half.) It was very good, but very rich!"
1581225,135350,2010-11-02,5,"This macaroni cheese was very rich, creamy and tasty. While making it I was unsure why I had to stir the sauce for so long, but I am glad I did, I think it made the texture of the sauce smoother and creamier and less grainy than other cheese sauces. The buttered bread crumbs add a wonderful texture to the dish, I would never leave them out. I will definately keep this recipe to make it again!"
8629,135350,2010-12-28,4,My husband liked this alot. I thought it was an average tasting mac and cheese recipe.
1052873,135350,2011-01-08,5,"Just like mom used to make except now we have pre-grated cheese! I thought about making it with just milk after I found my cream was chunky, but I used a heavy cream substitute (1/3 cup melted butter whisked into 3/4 cup milk). I did add 1/4 tsp dry mustard and used Panko on top. Had to broil it a little to get the Panko to crisp up."
285039,135350,2011-02-07,5,"This is a very good recipe as written.  I used New York Sharp Cheddar, but added 4 oz of fresh mozzarella I had to use up.  It was creamy and delicious.   I smashed garlic-butter croutons and sprinkled them on top in place of buttery breadcrumbs.   Homemade Mac n Cheese is my hubby's favorite meal, and this is one of the best I have found! Thanks for posting!"
318235,135350,2011-03-01,5,Wowie! Can't get any tastier. I used a white vermont sharp cheddar. Really creamy and delicious. Maybe it's just me but I think next time I might add even more cheese! Lol defintely a favorite. Thank you!
111291,135350,2011-10-04,5,"Oh, I have been craving comfort food and this hit the ""spot""! I made as posted except I added approximately 4 oz. of light cream cheese and used 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar and 1/2 cup of monterey jack cheese; also added 1/8-1/4 tsp. ground mustard.  Topped with 1/3 c. buttered bread crumbs and sprinkle of cheyenne pepper, chili powder and paprika. Delish! Thanks for posting."
2041603,135350,2011-10-27,5,This recipe does take a little bit of work but it tastes so good! Thank you!!
368078,135350,2011-12-19,5,"My DH and I have decided this is officially our favorite baked Mac and cheese.  The first time we added 1/2 t of mustard powder and garlic powder and used Cheddar Jack cheese. This macaroni was a nice, thick consistency with an amazing taste. ****Update: We made again and used White Wisconsin Cheddar cheese from Trader Joe's and added green onions.  We topped with 3/4 C crushed up Ritz crackers instead of buttered breadcrumbs (Yumm!!) and upped the salt to 1t.  We didn't even need to add the mustard pwdr and garlic pwdr this time b/c it was perfect just the way it was.  We definitely like our updated version even better than the first!!"
97579,135350,2012-06-01,5,"This was amazing!  I doubled the recipe to 8 servings.  It called for 2 c. of milk & 2. of cream.  I didn't have cream so I used (1) 12 oz. can of evaporated milk, which came out to be 1.5 c, and 2.5 c. of milk.  It was perfect!!"
251626,135350,2012-07-06,4,Pretty good
191533,135350,2012-10-21,5,"Wonderful! I especially liked ""jehaas""s review with helpful hints on the white sauce. Don't add salt and pepper before the cheese, because the cheese will add a good amount of sodium. I used a NY Aged Cheddar, and it was delicious! Next time I want to try with a cheese that is not too sharp."
456858,135350,2013-02-26,5,"This was really good and really easy.  So worth the constant stirring.  Did eliminate the buttered breadcrumbs, but again, very tasty."
400708,135350,2013-07-27,5,"Made this last night and the whole family loved it - including a very picky eater nephew who declared it &quot;the best&quot; it was so easy that even that 6 year old nephew made most of it with only a little supervision.  I made as directed with only one small change - adding an extra 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese as that finished off what I had on hand.  It made a lot and that&#039;s good as we&#039;ll be having the left overs today.  Had the wonderful, creamy, cheesy goodness we love, and looked pretty too - who could ask for more."
199020,135350,2014-01-22,5,Very good mac &#039;n cheese!
914720,135350,2014-11-17,5,"This was a great comfort food.  I used Cabot Extra Sharp Cheddar, and used skim milk and half &amp; half with no ill effects.  Leftovers reheated beautifully.  8 y.o. DS absolutely loved it.  Thanks for sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated 11/2104 to add:  I don&#039;t know why I even bother trying other mac &amp; cheese recipes; they always leave me disappointed, and I eventually find my way back here.  In a hurry, I used a pre-grated &quot;artisan&quot; cheddar blend from Sargento.  It was just as good as with the Cabot."
158086,79595,2005-02-17,5,Made these for Valentines Dinner and they were a big hit...very good and even good warmed up again in microwave
173579,79595,2005-03-07,5,These are the best Twice-Baked potatoes that I have tasted.  My whole family raved over them.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
189616,79595,2005-06-10,5,"Absolutely Delicious, the only thing I did different was add the bacon directly to the mixture.
Thank You-LorenLou!"
98919,79595,2005-10-23,5,Add my 5 stars to the list...very tasty!
142559,79595,2005-11-12,5,"Wonderful! I lost own recipe for these and was glad to see yours on here. The only thing I did different, was add chopped green onions and put the bacon in instead of on top of the potatoes. Also, I put all of the ingredients in my KitchenAid mixer and they were so smooth and creamy! I served them at a dinner party tonight and they were a hit! Thanks so much!!"
92816,79595,2006-01-29,5,This deserves more than the mere 5 stars.It is delicious!!I only used 2 potatoes and split all the other ingredient amounts in half.It worked out perfectly.Thanks for posting!!
147109,79595,2006-06-09,5,"Okay, this does not need more reviews...but I just have to echo all the fabulous reviews already, this are the best by far!  Thanks so much!"
180090,79595,2007-03-30,5,"This was my first time making twice baked potatoes and it turned out wonderful and delicious! I used butter instead of margarine. These are fairly easy to make and taste sooo yummy. Thanks for the recipe, I'll have to double it next time!"
218535,79595,2008-04-21,3,"I gave it 3 stars because although it is good, it isn't the best I ever had. I'll keep looking."
248023,79595,2007-11-15,4,"I was in the mood for some comforting soup and a baked potato for dinner and decided to try a twice baked potato instead of my usual ""plain"" ones...  I baked 2 potatoes since there is only the two of us and cut all the ingredients in half...  The pulp was very easy to mash up with all the other ingredients and really filled the shells to the brim.  I sprinkled the tops with bacon and a little green onions... just delicious and went well with Recipe #42071.  Thanks for sharing an easy and different way to spice up a potato!!!"
185285,79595,2007-11-29,5,"I'm not a big baked potato fan. DH, however gave this recipe 4 thumbs up!  (That's 2 thumbs after the first bite and 2 more thumbs part of the way into his second helping.)  I used skim milk and LF sour cream and before bakiing my poatoes, I coated them with Kosher salt as I typically would. Wonderful recipe, thanks!"
353131,79595,2008-02-08,5,I make these for my daughters! This is their favorite way to have spuds!! Great recipe! DH enjoys them also!
383346,79595,2008-02-18,5,Very easy to do.  I used butter to have a better taste :p   I used regular cheddar cheese cause I didn't have sharp.  Next time I'll add chives.  Delicious.  Thanks Loren :)
142367,79595,2008-02-18,4,Very easy to put together and quite tasty.  Thanks for sharing.
125640,79595,2008-08-08,5,"Great quick potato dish. Very tasty and creamy. I halved the recipe this time, but I read in some other reviews that these freeze well, so next time I'll make a lot and freeze the extras. Thanks."
426903,79595,2008-12-08,5,"Very tasty, thanks for posting!"
55578,79595,2008-12-18,5,"Everyone loved the potatoes, and they were very easy to make."
135887,79595,2008-12-26,5,I doubled this for Christmas dinner with our prime rib.  Outstanding!  I made them a day ahead and then just warmed them up.  They were delicious!  Just the right creamy consistency.
499050,79595,2009-02-25,5,Yum!
126440,79595,2009-10-17,5,"Great potato.  I baked 3 potatoes and used one slice of bacon, but the rest as written.  Served them with a great BBQ steak and Recipe #86343."
173314,79595,2009-10-23,5,Delicious. I flash froze some and stored for future use in ziploc bags in freezer. thanks
53932,79595,2010-01-16,5,Wow!  Excellent.  I used only half of everything (except the potato) and this was still great.
315055,79595,2010-01-27,4,"These were pretty good, but there was way too much butter.  In the future I might use 1 Tbsp of butter, but that would be it.  The skins didn't stay that intact so I ended up putting the paste in a dish in the oven and just serving it in scoops, it turned out nicely."
318235,79595,2010-02-07,3,"These were good but mine came out a little dry. Also, the flavor was lacking something. Maybe season-all salt would do the trick next time. Thank you."
195589,79595,2010-03-24,5,"Had these last nite...and YUMMM! I used unsalted butter instead of the margarine. I added the milk gradually, til it was the consistency we like, maybe only 1/8th of a cup. Also added some Montreal Seasoning to the tater mixture, so left out the salt and pepper. I froze half of these on a baking sheet, then after 2 hours, transferred to freezer bags. Can't wait to have these again. Thanks for posting, LorenLou."
789516,79595,2011-08-04,5,"1 guest told me these were the best potatoes he's ever had!  I agree!  Not easy getting potatoes out of the shell without tearing the skin, but it was worth the effort."
199020,79595,2011-11-14,5,"My mom used to make these when I was younger. I forgot how good they are! And so easy, too!"
203325,79595,2012-04-27,5,Delicious potatoes.   Wouldn't change a thing.
2549237,79595,2014-02-04,4,"The taste on these is magnificent.  I however apparently don&#039;t have the knack for taking apart baked potatoes and putting them back together.  My potatoes kept breaking and after about two potatoes I gave up and diced them and then mixed them in the potato stuffing ingredients and baked them in a casserole dish.  I&#039;m going to try to go threw all of the reviews and see if I can get some tips on how to properly make these, because I think they would be very well received in our family.  Thank you for a yummy tasting dish LorenLou."
28649,31516,2002-07-16,5,This was very easy to prepare and very good.  I really loved the rice mixture.  I could just eat that without the chicken.  The chicken was moist and tasty.  I will be making this again.
38643,31516,2002-07-25,5,Easy to make and very good!
59473,31516,2004-02-04,5,This is 5 star for sure. You were right when you said throw it  together and pop it in the oven. This was so easy to prepare. I didn't change a thing and it was absolutely delicious. I will definately make this again. Thanks for a great recipe.
64934,31516,2004-03-09,5,"What more can I add about this fabulous recipe!  I used ""hot"" salsa and also added a few shakes of hot sauce.  I also added the black beans.  I cooked this for one hour since I was concerned about the rice not being cooked.  It was absolutely delicious!  I certainly will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing."
147109,31516,2005-05-20,5,"This was so good!  I don't know what I did wrong, because it was a little too soupy for our tastes, but it was still fantastic.  My husband requested that next time I just cut the chicken up into pieces, so I will try that.  The only cheese I had on hand was mozzerella, but it still was so yummy!  I also used fat free cream of chicken soup (maybe that is why it was more watery??) :) I will be trying this again soon!"
32058,31516,2006-02-01,5,We loved this!  Simple yet good tasting dish.  I omitted corn.  I sprinkled chili powder on top along with salt and pepper.  Next time since i have two children I'll leave the chili powder off.  The salsa had enough kick to it!   To serve we sprinkled with a Mexican Cheese blend and sour cream.  Yummy!  TY
146486,31516,2006-10-20,5,This is a wonderful quick and easy meal.  Just throw the ingredients together and pop it in the oven.  Loved the flavor!  Thanks for a great recipe!
125640,31516,2007-07-14,5,"This recipe was really good. Quick and easy. I think maybe this recipe is meant to call for instant long-grain rice as that's what I used and it cooked perfectly in 45 minutes with the amount of liquid listed. The first time I made this I made it as directed opting for the black beans and using a medium salsa. The flavor was nice, but I made a couple of changes this time: I subbed cream a mushroom with garlic for the cream of chicken and mixed 1/2 tsp each cumin and salt and an extra 1/2 cup of cheddar into the rice mixture. Definately made the recipe suit our tastes. Thanks for sharing."
236170,31516,2007-12-01,5,My husband LOVED this! He's a big fan of rice and I don't make it all that often so he was really happy. This was an easy meal to make after work and have on the table with not much prep. Thanks Aroostook!
203325,31516,2008-01-01,4,"This was a really easy dish to put together.  I did as suggested and soaked the rice for 10 minutes and it came out perfect.  I also sprinkled the chicken with a dry chipolte powder for a nice smokey, spicy flavor."
377581,31516,2008-01-11,5,Good recipe! I used cream of mushroom soup. This was easy to make. The flavor was really good! My family loved it. Thank you for posting!
265954,31516,2008-01-13,4,"I tweaked this recipe a bit and it came out great.  Here is what I did:  I soaked the rice for 10 minutes first and also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt and black pepper. Then, I used the entire 11 oz. container of salsa (medium), 11.5 oz. can corn (drained), 10.5 oz. Goya black beans (cannot drain) and baked for 45 minutes covered.  After that, it was still too watery and I had not yet added the cheese, so I sprinkled about 1/2 cup of cheese and baked UNCOVERED for 10 more minutes.  The chicken was tender and the rice was cooked just fine, not hard or soggy.  I HIGHLY recommend soaking the rice first, and also seasoning the chicken before baking.  This is one of those dishes that you just know will be great for dinner, and great as leftovers the next day.  Thanks for posting, Barb!"
44383,31516,2008-03-16,5,"I made this tonight for a crowd of family and it was a super hit!  Didn't change a thing, it was really easy to put together but I did cut the breasts in half (they were a little large) and have now got requests for copies before they leave.  While I'm here to print those I thought I'd add my rave review. I love it when a recipe makes me look so clever in the kitchen. Thanks!"
140132,31516,2009-03-24,4,"I made this without the black beans and we loved this.  It was simple to throw together and baked up nice and tasty.  I served this with tortilla chips, guacamole and sour cream.  Delicious meal, thank you for posting."
187373,31516,2009-03-24,4,"Nice recipe for a quick (as far as prep time) and easy meal. I definitely recommend adding the black beans. I used some hot salsa and, wow, it was really spicy!  The chicken was tender; I did season it with some chili garlic rub.  I did have to cook  longer until rice was cooked through. Thanks for posting!  Would make again for those nights I don't want to have to think about cooking!"
98919,31516,2010-08-17,0,"Loved this!!  I used recipe #96988, ""Turn Your Crock Pot Into a Smokehouse Chicken"" (about 1/2 of the prepared smoked chicken that had been deboned) and chopped and mixed it up in the recipe with about 1 T. dried minced onions and 1/4 t. cumin and added it to the rest of the seasoning called for in the recipe.  Cooked it 1 hour, added the cheese and let it sit for awhile to absorb the rest of the liquid. So flavorful!!  Thanks for sharing..it's a keeper."
789516,31516,2011-03-31,5,This was so easy to put together.. and tasted great!  The chicken cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful along with the jasmine rice.  I used broth instead of water and only 2 boneless skinless breasts.  I used a dish with a tight fitting lid AND tinfoil under neither and it still took 1 hour and 5 minutes to cook.  The rice was still crunchy and hadnt absorbed the liquid after 45 minutes.
158086,31516,2011-04-21,5,This was a fast easy weeknight recipe..I used chicken tenders and cooked it for one hour...turned out perfect..I too added a can of green chopped chilies...
176615,31516,2011-05-08,5,"Yummy and super easy for a busy weeknight. Instead of canned soup, I used Recipe #360192. Baked for 1 hour. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
2041603,31516,2011-10-27,5,"This dish is amazing. It is very similar to the crockpot recipe #89204, which is also amazing! I only eat brown rice and with this we have to use parboiled rice rather than the regular brown rice, or just cook it a lot longer. We also used our own cream of chicken soup mix rather than the canned stuff.  Such a good recipe!!"
37779,31516,2012-03-07,4,Very easy to put together. I used medium salsa and the optional black beans. Yummy Tex-Mex flavor and something a beginner cook could make.  Thanks for the recipe.
218535,31516,2012-03-26,3,My rice was soggy and the chicken was bland.
389431,31516,2012-10-05,3,This was ok... Took almost 1.5 hours before it was no longer soup...  still had to add plenty of cheese to thicken it up... maybe my pan wasn't shallow enough??
371738,31516,2012-10-24,4,"The only change I made was using broth rather than cream of chicken. Just a preference. I also partially boiled the rice in water with some chili powder, just to speed things up in the oven.  Chicken tenders were very moist. I did add the black beans. The recipe was good and very easy, so I'm giving it 4 stars, but it wasn't exactly the fabulous dish I expected after reading the outstanding reviews. Will make again, though. Thanks for posting."
37036,31516,2013-07-02,5,"Very tasty!  I used my husbands homemade salsa from the garden, 3/4 teaspoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon cumin.  I left the corn and the beans out and used chicken thighs.  My whole family liked it.  I had enough to take for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for posting!"
42720,31516,2016-08-01,5,"I have made this recipe several times now and just realized I never reviewed it. My husband and I both love the convenience of this recipe as well as the taste. Sometimes I leave out the beans and just use corn. By the way, neither of us are fond of black beans so I always substitute pinto beans. I sometimes chop and add some onion or chopped poblano pepper. This is one of those recipes that is wonderful as originally written as well as being very adaptable to a few changes. Thank you so much for posting this recipe."
894666,31516,2017-05-10,5,"This was soo easy. Skipped the corn and beans, added in a a handful of green onions that needed to get used. Checked rice at 45 mins, was still too hard, another 10 mins or so was perfectly cooked. Topped with our family's fave cheese, Queso Supremo which is this great quesadilla cheese. I made sure to submerge the chicken in the sauce mix prior to cooking so help it not dry out. The kids ate it so it's gonna be a repeat for sure!"
37036,33665,2002-08-05,5,"These were AWESOME!  My whole family loved them!  My husband even raved about them, and he normally doesn't say too much when I try a new dish out on him.  I served them with spanish rice and charro beans.  I followed your directions exactly and topped them with sour cream and fresh chopped jalapenos!  I will definitely be making these often!  Thanks for posting a great recipe!"
39835,33665,2002-08-19,4,Excellent easy recipe that my family loved. My ds said they were the best burritos I ever made. Thanks Terri for posting this recipe. I will be making these again soon.
22015,33665,2003-12-11,5,These are excellent!  Love the flavor although I was a tad skeptical when I saw the gravy but it came together beautifully.  Thanks!
37449,33665,2004-01-18,5,"This is definately a keeper! I didn't use meat, just beans which I cooked in the crockpot, then mashed. I didn't have botteled gravy so used some from another dish I had made. this turned out nice with lots of sauce and my whole family loved it! Thanks Terri!"
101034,33665,2004-03-11,4,"I served these for company last night and everyone enjoyed them. I doubled the recipe, but other than that, I didn't change a thing. The sauce was so tasty, just the right amount of seasonings. "
101823,33665,2004-03-19,5,"I have had this recipe in my cookbook for some time, but didn't remember to buy the brown gravy on my trips to the store (the other ingredients are common staples).  I am so glad that I finally got my act together and tried these.  The sauce for these Wet Burritos is soooo good.  We will definately make these again...and I will probably use the sauce for my own enchillada recipe.  :)"
37636,33665,2004-07-28,5,"This is a recipe I've had in my cookbook since the day it posted and I could kick myself for not preparing it sooner. It's delicious! Now we know where Taco Bell got their idea for the ""Enchirito"", but this is so much better, believe me. Forget Taco Bell, fix this and never look back! Thanks for the recipe! -- posted May 8, 2003 Updated 07-28-04 I have made these so many times, and believe me, they taste perfect just as the recipe is written. They are huge! A meal in itself, and definitely a family favorite here. I wouldn't think of making wet burritos any other way! Thanks so much!"
49304,33665,2004-08-21,5,"Oh My Gosh, These are Delicious, We had never had a wet burrito.
Very filling, easy to prepare. I to was leary of the brown gravy in the sauce, gee, it gives it such good flavor. I used ground turkey instead of beef, 1 can of refried beans, used shredded mexican blend cheese, (the spices are just right for us) and Low carb-whole wheat tortillas. Served with sour cream and my home canned salsa. I can't wait to make them for our DS & DDIL they will love them. Thank you Terri, for posting such a delicious recipe."
173314,33665,2005-01-27,5,I thought I had reviewed this and saw I still needed to.  Very good recipe.  I combined the beef and bean mixture into one.  Thanks!
168462,33665,2005-01-31,5,Fantastic and so flavourful. Had to make a few substitutions because of what was in the pantry. Used tomato sauce not diced tomatoes. Also used salsa for the enchilada sauce. Will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the great recipe.
222055,33665,2006-03-29,4,"This was a very good dish. We definetly enjoyed it. I think we favor the dry burritos alittle more. I would give it 5 stars if I thought I would make it again, but I probably won't (and not because it wasn't good!). "
93006,33665,2006-05-05,4,"Very good and easy to put together...used very lean meat and fat-free beans and they were still very flavorful.  Makes alot of sauce.....I also got 6 burritos out of this recipe, using soft-taco size tortillas.  Yummy with shredded lettuce, sour cream and black olives on top!"
142367,33665,2006-05-28,5,"I have to give this recipe 5 stars, as my guys voted it ""a keeper!""   I used green enchilada sauce and combined with the beef gravy it wasn't the most appetizing color, but it turned out great. Thanks for sharing Terri!"
158086,33665,2006-10-05,5,Thought I would try a different recipe as I have made the Fabulous Wet Burrito #122179 which are very good...these turned out great...I did enjoy the sauce...I am sure I will be making these again.
185446,33665,2006-10-28,5,It's hard to comment after 69 other glowing reviews...  Add my name to the growing list of happy wet burrito eaters--thanks for a wonderful recipe.
140132,33665,2007-04-19,5,"I am one who has never heard of a ""wet"" burrito.  But, I am glad you introduced me to them.  My family really enjoyed these.  I liked the flavor of the enchiladia sauce with the beef gravy.  Yummy.  I will make this often as we really liked them.  I served these with spanish rice and tortilla chips and guacamole....Stephanie"
222564,33665,2007-04-26,4,"Real yummy and filling! Then again, the two of us almost polished the whole dish, no wonder we are slightly over filled. I took advice of Mark H's comments and added some salt and heat to the meat. And only added 10 oz gravy to the enchilada sauce, since it was getting to look rather thin. This was delicious!"
91392,33665,2007-07-01,5,"I have had this recipe in my cookbook for ages and just only today made it--a shame.  Very good although quite a production to make.  I live in a place where nothing is available so I made the enchilada sauce, refried beans, etc etc.  The meat mixture did need salt, but that is all I would change.  Recipe says it makes 4, they would be huge, I'm glad I made it into 6, next time might use it to make 8 servings.  I couldn't eat the whole one having made 6, the husband did, but we both vowed to have soup for dinner. Good one, anyone would like it."
278113,33665,2007-10-07,4,"These were pretty good, but I thought they were a bit bland for our tastes."
231054,33665,2007-10-08,3,"You have so many high, high ratings -- I know my 3 stars are not going to look good -- but the 3 stars says ""we liked it"".  I'm not sure about the sauce -- the beef gravy seemed strange to me -- and I think that was the reason this didn't get bumped up to more stars.  I definitely will make this again -- but I think I'll omit the gravy.  To me it just took away from the true Mexican flavor of the sauce.  And like someone else said, I think the next time I will combine the meat and bean mixture -- and then fill the tortilla.  I had a can of green chilies that I wanted to toss in -- but felt I needed to follow your recipe and instructions for the firs time making it.  The next time I will definitely include the chilies in with the meat/bean mixture.  I'm very happy to have this recipe. And I thank you for sharing it with so many people."
377581,33665,2008-02-14,4,This is very good. It makes a lot too. I added some salt  and an extra clove of garlic but other than that made as directed. Thank you. I'll definitely make this again!
8688,33665,2008-04-22,5,"If you love Mexican food and have not tried this recipe ~ make plans to do it tonight! This is SO simple to prepare, it would be a shame not to try this! My husband and I both felt this recipe is better than the burritos you get at a Mexican Restaurant! When putting together the ingredients for this recipe, be certain not to skip the condiments which are a vital addition!!! I got 5 large burritos from  these ingredients, still fitting perfectly into the 13x9"" pan.  It might be a good idea to spread a bit of the gravy on the bottom of the pan before adding the burritos, as they did stick just a bit when serving.  I used lots of Mexican blend of cheeses to top before putting into the oven. Terri, we may not go out for Mexican anymore!!  We have it all right here at home : )  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!!"
229850,33665,2008-05-05,5,"Never had a wet burrito before, these were awesome!!! Thanks for introducing me to a new taste that is   quite a treat !!!!"
248023,33665,2008-05-13,5,"Even with all great reviews, I was hesitant to make these because of the beef gravy in the sauce.  It just sounded really weird to me!  But I gave in when my BF requested burritos for dinner.  I made these as written except I chose to make Recipe #187128 to sub for the jarred stuff.  I also didn't add in the cumin to the beans, since I didn't want to over-season the filling.  I tasted the sauce before I poured it over the burritos and was so pleasantly surprised.  It was delicious.  My BF was upset I didn't make ""dry"" burritos but after one taste, he has been converted!  A great meal...  thanks for a great recipe!!!"
74281,33665,2008-05-27,5,"After my Dad told me a story of having brown gravy on enchiladas at Mexican restaurant in Columbus, OH I had to try this recipe. And with 120 other reviews, I was not too nervous - with good reason! These Wet Burritos are easy to throw together and delicious! The only thing I did differently from the recipe was instead of pputting 1/4 of the beans in each tortilla, I just dumped the beans into the ground beef, then stirred in the cheese and THEN rolled it into the tortillas. I am so glad that I doubled the recipe and made two pans because now the entire family can look forward to these again soon!!"
125640,33665,2008-06-06,4,"Easy to make and flavorful, but dirtied up a lot of dishes. We had a lot of leftovers and we're pretty good eaters. I think this could feed 6 easily. Nobody was really sold on the sauce the first time I made it, so I tried different enchilada sauce and smaller jar of gravy the second time and we still didn't like it. Too bad, I remembered really liking the wet burritos we had at a local Mexican restaurant as a kid, but have no idea what the sauce was. Thanks anyway.
Update: We really like this if you just leave the gravy out and use extra enchilada sauce. I've also found you can save a dirty pot by just adding the beans and cumin to the meat after it browns and heating it for a couple minutes, and it tastes exactly the same."
222970,33665,2008-09-20,4,"My kids want to have these again soon! My husband and I not so much. After trying them, I refer to them as ""Truck Stop Burritos."" Nothing Mexican or even particularly Tex-Mex about them. They'll probably go on a once a month rotation.

The amount of filling listed made 12 good sized burritos and there was more than enough gravy for all of them. The children cheered when they realized they got leftovers for lunch the next day."
180090,33665,2008-09-30,5,"These turned out very good! They are very filling and have a good flavor. They are like enchiladas and the taste reminds me of a more time consuming recipe I always make, but these are a lot easier. My husband really liked them and he's hard to please. I will be making again! Thank you!"
497077,33665,2008-11-02,4,These were OK but I really did not care for the gravy in the sauce-perhaps it was the brand of gravy I used-will try w/o next time. This was a very easy recipe; made 8 large burritos; great flavor but I did add more spices and heat for our taste. Thank you!
499050,33665,2008-12-20,4,Very Good!
126440,33665,2008-12-28,5,I have made these a few times.  This last time I cut the recipe in half to make two servings.  Very filling.  Be sure to put toppings on after taking from the oven.  Good recipe.
355637,33665,2009-01-13,4,The sauce makes the meal! Yum!
242484,33665,2009-03-07,5,Very well deserving of 5 stars! The only change I will do next time is  make 1/2 the gravy sauce and not serve any extra sauce with the burrito when I plate it up.
485151,33665,2009-09-22,5,This is more than a 5-star recipe! We all loved it! I used recipe #42094 Texas Red Enchilada Sauce in place of store bought.
532289,33665,2009-11-10,5,Excellent.  DH gave it good reviews which is rare.  Made as directed except I omitted the beef gravy (I didn't have any on hand) and the flavor was superb.  The seasonings were perfect for the taco meat.  This is a good change from the packet seasoning.
298447,33665,2010-03-23,5,"These were a hit at my house.  I deviated from the recipe just a little bit:  I replaced the canned enchilada sauce with Mark H.'s Recipe #42094, used regular oregano, and wrapped in whole wheat tortillas.  I also used fajita sized tortillas so i could eek out a couple more servings and lower the portion size a bit.  Although I really liked what the jarred gravy added to the recipe, I don't generally like the extra sodium it lends, so next time, I may omit or search for a suitable alternative.  Overall, something I am sure my family would love to eat weekly, but will serve a little more sparingly (esp. after noticing the nutrition facts- ha!)  Served with Spanish rice.  Thanks again!"
914720,33665,2010-09-01,5,"Huge hit at our house!  My 9 year old declared this ""the best burrito I ever had.""  Other than forgetting a few minor details, I followed the recipe exactly.  I used 11"" jalapeno-cheddar tortilla ""wraps"", which was perfect for four burritos.  Thanks for posting!"
1269015,33665,2010-09-04,4,"This was a lot more work, or at least dirty pans, than our usual 'dry' burrito recipe. I made it with kidney beans instead of beef, and froze half the burritos for later -- we got waaaaaay more than 4 servings! I loved the flavors of the spice mix, but think all the separate cooking was a bit over the top for a vegetarian version. If I make this again I'll just combine the 'beef' steps with the refried beans, and use far less than 1 lb. kidney beans for 4 servings."
124190,33665,2011-07-18,4,"We liked these. I used brown gravy packets to substitute for the jar. I also substituted turkey for the ground beef. These were tasty. I think we prefer regular enchiladas, but it was a nice change. They were better the second day. Thanks for sharing!"
203325,33665,2011-12-03,5,These were a hit.   I followed the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing.
58836,105670,2005-04-25,5,I haven't actually used this recipe but I have made these.  They are absolutely wonderful.  I could eat the whole lot of them by myself.
52125,105670,2006-05-19,5,"There is not much to say about these, except they are just to die for EXCELLENT! Thanks for posting this recipe STEPHANIE LILLARD...."
59163,105670,2006-05-21,5,"These were fabulous.  If you don't like them as spicy take out most of the membrane inside of the pepper, this contributes to the heat level.  A little time consuming to make but definately worth the effort.  I think you could easily make these a day ahead and then just bake them when you need them."
35526,105670,2006-09-19,5,I took these camping and cooked them on a grill.  I just made a slit and removed the seeds and slipped in a piece of cream cheese and a piece of cheddar.  They were such a hit.  We will have these next time we camp too.  YUM
169969,105670,2006-09-23,5,These are AWESOME!!! I followed the tips left by Pot Scrubber and they came out fantastic. DH2B asked me to make them again tonight! I love poppers but the whole deep frying ordeal is such a pain - We didn't miss the breading at all.... and who can go wrong with bacon!!!! FABULOUS!!!!
158086,105670,2006-10-16,5,made these for euchre...they were a big hit....but boy are the a pistol to clean...the fumes were really getting to me...I had the front door open so I could get some fresh air and it was 30 degrees out...haha
230557,105670,2006-10-22,5,"Rich, creamy, and just the right amount of heat.  I added real bacon bits and mixed the cheeses together, then pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave so it'd be nice & crispy.  My 1lb. Oscar Meyer bacon package had 10 slices - enough for 20 peppers, with a little cheese mixture left over for some yummy stuffed mushrooms.  Clean up was easy because I used release foil.  The worst part of prep was scraping out the seeds - that took longer than the total 10 min. prep time listed - but overall it's an easy recipe.  Thanks!"
13796,105670,2006-11-11,5,"Ok.. I have to add my two cents here. Thess are delicious! BUT. ..  The wrapping of the bacon was too time consuming for me. My back started to hurt. My guests like the hot stuff and will eat these like candy. The firt batch I did as directed. My jalapeÃ±os weren't hot. They were all different sizes but none were really 'kickin'.  So... Second batch:   I sprinkled the insides of the peppers with a little Kosher salt and a bit of ground habanero pepper. These turned out very good.. but again..  it was too time consuming (and expensive) for me to wrap them in bacon. Some of them would tilt over and the bacon would unwrap a little. It was just not the easy appetizer I've been reading about here. Ok..    then I came up with this:  I sprinkled the pepper with the salt and hot pepper, stuffed with cream cheese and then sliced the bacon crosswise into a little less than 1/2-inch pieces and put a piece of bacon on the top of the cream cheese in each pepper half. I then sprinkled with some chili powder. Now I don't have to use 2 pounds of bacon. I used about 5 slices of bacon. The flavor of the bacon is still there.
Thanks for a great recipe. They are good no matter how you cook them. I just like to make things as easy as I can. Now I can whip these up in no time. "
132383,105670,2006-12-19,5,"The absolute hit of our Christmas Party...I scaled the recipe back and I was so sorry that I did.  They went so fast.  I did add slightly to the recipe.  I added Adobo (my husband is Puerto Rican and we use that in everything) to the cream cheese and I also pimientos (drained well. As another reviewer stated, I mixed the cheddar in the cream cheese too.  It was FABULOUS.  Going to make them again this weekend! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
229850,105670,2007-01-01,5,"These were very good, but I did have to bake them an additional 10 to get the bacon done enough. No big deal, could be my oven. But they went over very well. I would caution everyone again to use gloves when making these. I was too lazy and very busy, so I was out of them in the kitchen and didn't take time to go get any out of storage, and what did I do, I touch my eye even after I had washed my hands very well, there was still some of the heat under my fingernail I guess, but oh my, couldn't see for a while. And yes I do know better, so that's what I get!!!!!!! But the recipe is delicious."
350750,105670,2007-01-02,5,Yummo! My friends mother makes these without the cheddar and they are still tasty.
182624,105670,2007-01-07,5,"I wish I could give this recipe 50 stars!!  I absolutely LOVE these poppers!  I especially love how easy these are to make!  Many times I've tried an appetizer that turns out to be very cumbersome to put together, especially the ""stuffed"" kind, but these are super easy and look fantastic.  They've definitely got some spice to them (of course), but if you prefer less spice, just use bigger peppers, since they have more cream cheese to balance it out.  It worked out perfect for my husband and me, as I love super spicy and he likes a little less, so he took the bigger, less spicy peppers, and we were both happy.  I would also recommend lining your baking sheet with foil.  I made it the first time without, and last night made them again with it lined and the cleanup was much easier.  I could easily eat the entire batch myself!  These will definitely be something I will crave often.  Thanks for an awesome recipe, Stephanie!! UPDATE: I made this last night, but just wasn't in the mood to stuff the peppers, so I decided to make it in dip form!  Lo and behold, it worked!  I very coarsely chopped the peppers and roasted them for five minutes or so.  Fried the bacon on the stovetop (used turkey bacon and it tasted great, although nothing is ever quite the same as the real thing), then mixed it all together.  Baked in the oven at the same temp until hot and gooey, about ten minutes.  ATE IT WITH A SPOON, which just seemed so wrong, but it tasted exactly the same and had the same amounts of everything, so I did my best to get over my feeling like a pig!  I posted a pic.  Would be great with tortilla chips!"
262312,105670,2007-03-04,5,"These were so awesome, I'm speechless!  I added sliced green onion and mixed the cheddar with the rest as suggested by other reviewers.  Delish!  We like things really spicy so I did half japs and half serrano peppers!  Thanks for the awesome keeper!"
142335,105670,2007-03-06,5,WOW! Possibly the best appitizer EVER! I can't wait to make these again.
447123,105670,2007-03-16,5,Love Love Love these little treats!!! I found them to be just great. You can adjust the hottness of them by simply leaving more seeds in them. These poppers were very easy to make as well. One little change I made.......... I mixed the cheddar cheese with the cream cheese. Turned out great. Thanks for a new family favorite AZRoxy63!!!
347822,105670,2007-05-29,4,"These were quick and very easy to make.  Instead of plain cheddar cheese, I added Sargento's mexican mix (4 types of cheese).  This round I popped them in the oven, next I want to try them on the grill!  Thank you for the posting."
37868,105670,2007-06-05,5,OH!! I enjoyed!! Nothing to change at all. It took me a bit longer to bake in the oven but still it was Great!!! I have a new word for anything way to good!! I call it NASTY GOOD!!! My taste buds are going crazy over the taste. Thank You for posting...Hugs
236170,105670,2007-06-12,5,Delicious! The cheese combines so wonderfully with the jalapeno so it's not too spicy. We halved the recipe since there is only two of us. They would be perfect to bring as an appetizer to a party!
125640,105670,2007-08-17,4,These were very good. I lined my pan with tinfoil and sprayed the tinfoil with non-stick spray for easy serving and cleanup. The only real change I made was to use a full strip of center cut bacon on each popper which  was very tasty. I promised DH that next time I'll try this recipe with sections of green bell pepper as he doesn't do spicy. Thanks for sharing.
400420,105670,2007-10-05,5,"These are the best! They have become my favorite appetizer for parties!  I've made them at least a dozen times in the last 10 months :-)  I've started dicing the bacon and pre-cooking it, then mixing the bacon bits in a bowl with the cream and cheddar cheeses.  It saves a little time and (if possible) they taste even better, because you get bacon in every bite and they are much less greasy this way.  My MIL even asked for these for her mother's day gift.  Thank you so much!  This is my favorite Zaar recipe!"
377039,105670,2007-10-20,5,"Using tips from other reviewers, I partially precooked the bacon for a minute in the microwave, and also softened the cream cheese and mixed the cheddar into it.  I mixed some seeds into half, and left the other half mild.  Otherwise I followed this as written.

It is outstanding. Delicious, mild (though adding seeds to filling kicked it up nicely too), and just perfect.  The prep time was just about right, too -- I just used a teaspoon and scooped out the seeds, so prepping the peppers didn't take long at all.  However, I made only a small batch, since there are only two of us -- I wish I'd made more!  I'll make this again and again.

**update** This has become a family favorite. I've made it again and again and it's always delicious. I've tried freezing after cooking, to reheat individually later; it's okay but the texture is totally lost. Best served fresh! Thanks again for an outstanding recipe!"
286851,105670,2007-12-26,4,"I made these yesterday for a family Christmas get-together. Though a bit time-consuming to make, they were a big hit. I took other reviewers' advice and partially pre-cooked the bacon prior to wrapping. Even with this, they still took longer than 15 minutes to get the bacon to cook all the way, more like 20 minutes. However, with the pre-cooking, I had no problems with the peppers burning at all. Because I had thoroughly de-veined and de-seeded the jalapenos, the peppers were quite mild when cooked. They were very well-liked by everyone who tried them. Next time, I may make half of them ""hotter"" by leaving in a few seeds or a bit of the vein. Overall, a big success, and I will definitely be making them again. Thanks for sharing."
218535,105670,2008-01-09,3,I baked it for 20 mins but my bacon still isn't crisp. It was good but not awesome.
185926,105670,2008-01-26,4,"The directions are great.  I had trouble getting the bacon wrapped around the peppers, but my peppers were kinda big.  The adults enjoyed these.  Although I did remove the inside of the peppers some of them were still spicy.  I actually enjoyed the spicy ones more.  They do get greasy from bacon and cheese, lining the pans with foil will help with cleaning."
377581,105670,2008-02-07,5,Outstanding and addictive! I softened the cream cheese and mixed the cheddar into it. Super easy but impressive appetizer! Thank you for posting!
497077,105670,2008-05-28,5,"These poppers are GREAT! I've made several times now-they are easy and fast to prepare-and this evening I made 6 just for DH and me-we love them! After reading the reviews, I did make some adjustments as follows: I mixed the cheeses together and one time used pepper jack cheese and one time I included cooked venison sausage bits; I used center cut bacon-not the thick cut and rendered the strips before wrapping; I lined my baking sheets w/ foil and cooked poppers on a rack so they aren't greasy. I gave my BIL the recipe and he makes his on the grill and both ways are delicious!!! Thank you for a great recipe!!!"
499050,105670,2008-07-18,5,Yum!
189475,105670,2008-12-01,5,"Wow, these were delicious!! They are better than the regular breaded poppers. One minor issue though...I think the 10 min prep is a very low estimate. It took me almost a half hour to make 20 poppers. Or maybe I'm just slow. Either way, it was no big deal because I had plenty of time but I wanted to mention it in case anyone else making this is in a hurry. I would have liked it if the jalapenos were spicier, but I guess the baking takes out most of the spice."
140132,105670,2008-12-18,5,I made these for the game and we all loved  them.  Even my daughter who doesnt' like HEAT loved these.  Thank you for the recipe to one of our favorite appies.
180090,105670,2009-01-07,5,I didn't try these but my guests loved them and I actually should have made more because we ran out very quickly. I only made about 12. I used finely shredded Mexican blend cheese and mixed it into the cream cheese. I put a toothpick through to hold the bacon on. And baked for 20 minutes in a 375 degree oven then broiled on high for about 2 minutes to crisp up the bacon a little bit more. Be sure to use thin or regular bacon and not thick so the bacon can crisp up easily. Thank you for the recipe! I'll be making it again for more parties.
195589,105670,2009-01-28,5,"Made a batch of these last weekend to preview before I make them for the Super Bowl. Yummmmmm! These are SO good, they will be my go-to recipe for poppers! I went thru lots of the previous reviews & these are the tips I used:
Lined baking sheet with foil and sprayed the foil with oil. Softened the cream cheese and added the cheddar to it. Used a grapefruit spoon to remove the seeds and membranes from the peppers. And, best of all, they freeze well! Thanks all for the great advice and thank you VERY much for posting AZRoxy63!"
355637,105670,2009-02-01,4,Made for the Super Bowl.... didn't last long!
199020,105670,2009-08-17,5,"These were great! I couldn't believe how mild the peppers were after baking them. My eyes and throat were burning just cutting them, so I was afraid they'd be too hot to eat. After 15 minutes in the oven, though, they were actually almost sweet. I wish I had some bacon to wrap them with...maybe next time!"
844554,105670,2009-09-30,5,"I've been making these for years. I use parchment paper, cook turkey bacon for 30 seconds in microwave and stretch the bacon so make it easier to stick a toothpick in. Love these!"
64642,105670,2009-12-13,5,The family just loved them!  Very easy to make.  Followed the recipe as written.
383346,105670,2012-02-29,5,Yummy!  Simple but so good.  The only thing I didn't like was the bacon to sizzle in the oven.  But the taste is amazing.  Thanks AZRoxy :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
369715,105670,2012-03-01,4,"My husband made these. As written he thought they were a bit bland but to the next batch he added some spices to the cheese mixture. He used season salt, garlic powder and pepper. They enjoyed them."
178742,105670,2013-02-12,5,"We LOVED it! The only thing I did differently was halved by bacon then cooked it some, and placed on top of the cheeses instead of wrapping it! Picture submitted! Thanks for sharing!"
198154,105670,2013-08-08,3,"I guess I should have read the reviews before I made these.  The cheddar melted off the popper, the bacon didn&#039;t crisp properly and the cream cheese needed something to add to the flavor.  Luckily we have lots of jalapenos in the garden.  So I will make these again using the suggestions in Raquel Grinnell&#039;s review. I will update review when I do.  I think this could be a great recipe with some tweaking."
305531,105670,2014-04-26,5,Yum! These are so good. My grandson loves to make these for us to snack on. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for Name That Ingredient Tag.
60989,95569,2004-07-20,5,"Simply awesome. I used about 3/4 of a bottle of hickory/honey bbq sauce, and only 1/2 a BIG onion, because that is all I had. The smell is incredible, the prep work is almost nothing and the taste is great when done. I cooked this for almost 9 hours on low and it was fine. My son had two of these... that makes this a complete winner! Thanks Kree :) "
55578,95569,2004-07-22,5,Why didn't I think of this???  It's easy and great for the crock pot.  I used low carb BBQ sauce.  Thanks!
121185,95569,2004-08-11,5,WOW!!  I can't believe that I (or anyone else) didn't think of this earlier!!  I made this while out RVing on Coronado Island.  We (our family of 5) and the in-laws LOVED it!  I used 2 lb. of chick. breast with a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's and one Sweet Onion (which I'll omit next time) and cooked it for 6.5-7 hours.  Shredded it and served it on homemade buns - viola!  I did have to take out about 2 cups of liquid when it was done cooking - so it wasn't so soupy...
26512,95569,2004-08-23,4,"I can't believe how simple this is! I added extra barbecue sauce at the end of the cook time and served on buns with pickles, onions & mustard. Not only is it very good, it's very low in fat, an added bonus! Thanks for sharing this recipe, we'll make this again."
43083,95569,2004-09-30,4,This was easy like everyone said. The taste was missing something but it could of been the BBQ sauce I used. Thanks for a quick crockpot meal! Next time will use a different sauce:)
133174,95569,2004-10-14,5,Awesome!  This was super easy and delicious.  I used my Memphis Barbecue Sauce (#98940) and added a touch of liquid smoke.  Shredded the chicken with two forks.  Served on lightly toasted whole wheat buns with Seasame Slaw (#41689). Thanks Kree for a wonderful easy meal.
104295,95569,2004-10-18,5,"I have made barbeque like this for a long time, but always with ribs bought on sale.  This is a much healthier alternative.  We enjoyed it tonight for dinner with broccoli & cauliflower, baked beans, and french fries.  Yum!"
101034,95569,2004-11-22,5,What a great recipe this it!! I sprinkled alittle of Emerils essence on each breast before adding them to the crock pot and I also added a few drops of hot sauce to the bar-b-que sauce. Wow...was this ever good!!!! I decided around 3PM to make this and put it into the crock on high and it was done perfectly in 4 hrs. Thanks Kree!
59780,95569,2004-12-13,5,What a great recipe! I will be making this again and again! I used Bobbie Q sauce recipe#59772 for the sauce. I have added this recipe to my crockpot recipe collection~thanks for posting!
40961,95569,2005-09-19,5,"Excellent taste, easy to prepare,thanks for sharing:)"
47907,95569,2005-12-04,5,This was so good!  We usually buy our chicken barbecue in a tub but no more!  The recipe was simple but tasted like I worked all day.  We served on buns with coleslaw and french fries.  Thanks so much for posting a keeper!
173579,95569,2006-04-12,5,We liked this a lot. I used Bullseye Barbeque Sauce. Can't get much easier than this.  Thanks for posting.
229524,95569,2007-03-25,2,With all the great reviews I thought this would be really good.  Nothing special.  My husbnad liked it better than me.  The flavor just wasn't there and the chicken was dry.
218535,95569,2007-06-03,4,"I liked how easy this is. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. I think thighs are more tender and juicy."
8688,95569,2007-08-21,5,"Nothing could be easier than this!  I used Kree's recommended barbecue sauce for a great pulled barbecue sandwich!  I served with Recipe #196430 and Recipe #229171 for a great weeknight meal.  Thanks so much, Kree!"
37779,95569,2007-09-17,5,"I made this for football Sunday. So easy, extremely tasty, and loved by everyone. I am a fan of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and used the hickory flavored version. I can't say enough how great we thought these sandwiches were. Thanks, Kree."
46660,95569,2007-10-01,5,"I'm surprised I had not yet reviewed this one!  It is a great and easy recipe!  I was extra lazy and bought a pre-sliced onion, so it was really no work at all!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  I ate my sandwich with some sliced hot cherry peppers...mmmmm!  This is a great standby recipe for a busy day!  Thanks!"
39301,95569,2007-10-27,5,"We all loved these sandwiches... including the kids, who gobbled up every bite. Thanks for posting this winner!"
377581,95569,2007-10-29,4,This is a recipe that you can make on the days you don't have a lot of time to cook or just don't feel up to cooking. This would be a great easy dish to prepare for potlucks. Everyone loved it and I will make it again. Thanks so much for posting!
76951,95569,2007-12-01,5,"5 stars for taste and ease of preparation.  This makes a great weeknight meal.  I could also see this as a great sandwich for a crowd; perfect for a carefree family get-together.  Thanks, Kree!"
125640,95569,2007-12-19,4,"This recipe couldn't be easier and it tasted good too. I sprinkled the chicken with garlic salt, pepper, and cayenne and shredded the chicken for the last half hour of cooking so the meat could soak up the sauce. I also added sliced cheese to the sandwiches and served them with potatoes. Great. Thanks for sharing."
95743,95569,2008-01-15,0,"I must be the only one in the world who thinks chicken breasts can be overcooked, particularly in a crockpot.  Sorry, Kree."
265954,95569,2008-02-13,4,"Tasty recipe!  I used 4 boneless chicken breasts, and a 16 oz. container of K.C. Masterpiece jerk chicken sauce.  I have a newer model crock pot, so my crock pot recipes always cook much more quickly than directed.  I cooked on low for 4 hours, stirring once an hour so the sauce remained on top of the chicken.  I then removed the chicken, shredded it with a knife and fork, and returned to the crock pot so it could simmer in the sauce on low for another hour and a half.  Total cooking time was 5 and a half hours.  I served it on baked Pillsbury Southern biscuits, which I would not recommend, as they are too small.  Opt for the hamburger buns instead, and you may want to toast them so they don't get mushy from the chicken mixture.  I thought the 16 oz. jar of sauce resulted in a recipe a tad too tangy.  Thus, next time, I'll use just enough sauce to cover the chicken, then once the chicken is shredded, I'll add more sauce as needed.  Thanks for this great and easy recipe!!"
146486,95569,2008-04-28,5,This turned out so great.  I used 4 lbs of chicken and chopped the onion.  I added half a bottle of sweet baby ray's barbeque sauce and cooked on high for 3 hours.  It had a ton of liquid after this time so I transferred the chicken and onions to a large bowl and shredded it then.  I added the other half of the bottle of barbeque sauce and mixed all together.  We loved it!  Fabulous barbeque chicken and so easy!  Thanks Kree!
229850,95569,2008-09-22,4,This was quick fast and easy for a busy day. I used a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Very simple and good. Thankyou for sharing.
140132,95569,2009-01-05,4,We had this and was a hit.  I had chicken and was looking for something different.  I tried this and the family gave it a big thumbs up.  thank you for a recipe for chicken that is something new forus.
111291,95569,2009-01-28,5,"Wow! Didn't expect to like this as much as I did! Reminds me of pulled pork or pig roast shredded pork sandwiches (except tastier and MUCH better for us!)! The chicken was tender and full of flavor. Served this with a side of cole slaw. PERFECT! Next time if I have leftovers (didn't this time) I will make a bar-b-que chicken, cheddar and green pepper pizza!"
140806,95569,2009-01-30,5,Couldn't have been easier! I made Recipe #7791 for the sauce and scaled down the amounts for 2 servings. DH was in heaven when he took his first bite. The chicken fell apart when I went to shred it. Thanks for the simple and delicious recipe!
74281,95569,2009-03-04,5,So easy and really delicious! Even easier for me as I left out the onion and sprinkled onion powder on the chicken. My 2-1/2 year old twin granddaughters ate adult sized portions and I had leftovers for lunch that turned out great too!
68884,95569,2009-06-16,5,"*Surprisingly* delicious!
I am back to work after having a baby, so Quick & Easy recipes are at the top of my list right now. I thought this recipe would make a serviceable, but not exciting, dinner.
Wrong. I used chicken that was still mostly frozen (had placed in fridge overnight from freezer), a store-brand bottle of BBQ sauce to which I added some black pepper, garlic & chili powder, and a mix of red & white onion slices.
Heavenly! The onion kind of ""melted"" into the meat/sauce, it was so tender it fell off the fork while I was trying to shred it, & DH and I enjoyed it on toasted whole-wheat buns.
I'll make this again & again."
101823,95569,2009-06-20,5,"Following newspapergal's lead, I doctored up some cheap BBQ sauce that was hanging out in the pantry and was amazed at how good this was. We layered the shredded chicken on toasted whole wheat buns and topped with mounds of creamy coleslaw. Yum. So easy and so good."
242484,95569,2009-09-09,5,These are really easy and really delicious!
359220,95569,2009-10-20,5,"This was a regular dinner when I was growing up!  I never realized how great of a life-saver it really was until I had a home of my own!  It doesn't get much easier than this- juicy, saucy, sweet and an easy way to have a warm dinner at the end of a long day.   Sometimes I make 2 or 3 packages of chicken worth then use it on top of pizza, mashed potatoes or buns.  Yum, making my mouth water already!"
532289,95569,2009-11-11,4,Simple and easy.  I'm on the lookout for crock pot meal meals and this is a keeper.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled with garlic salt and pepper.  I also shredded the cooked chicken and placed back in the pot to cook with the bbq sauce.  Thanks Kree I will make again and the bbq onions are great!  Next time I will serve this with those onion hamburger buns.
39835,95569,2009-12-27,5,"This was delicious -- threw the chicken, onion and 1/2 bottle of barbecue cause in the crockpot - went out for the day - sandwiches and salad -- dinner is done -- with virtually no work -- and delicious too! Thanks for sharing!"
407007,95569,2009-12-29,5,"Oh.. my.. goodness! This is SOOOOO amazingly good and absolutely NO work. I just put in about 1 lb frozen chicken with a whole bottle of Stubb's Smokey Mesquite BBQ sauce (I've found it's the most low calorie bbq sauce! ;)) and omitted the onion. Turned on the crock pot and went about my day. The last hour of cooking I removed the breasts, shredded them, and put them back in the sauce in the crock pot on the WARM setting so they could absorb all that sauce. I also added some Chipotle Tabasco sauce, salt & pepper. I went and worked out, came back and put some shredded chicken on top of salad greens for a nice healthy, low-carb option. I topped it with a litte bit of sour cream & salsa mixed together as a dressing. The whole time I ate that salad I was getting almost giddy with delight that something so easy could be so healthy and so yummy. Thank you SO much for sharing - this will become a staple in our house!"
8629,95569,2010-05-24,5,I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce. I was surprised at how flavorful the meat was.   I cooked mine on high for one hour and then low for about 3 more hours.
38643,95569,2010-05-25,5,I can't believe how something so simple can be so good.  We used Sweet Baby Rays original and  a vadalia onion-perfect!
312577,95569,2010-09-08,5,"Thank you for posting this recipe. I read all the reviews and found that I had like many of the reviewers used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce.  I shred the chicken after 4-5 hours and let it soak up all the sauce.  Also, I added a couple teaspons of liquid smoke.  I have used this recipe before and intend on using it many times in the future.  Great recipe.  The taste along with the ease of preparation cannot be beat!!"
15521,95569,2010-09-10,0,"Tasty and Easy gets five stars in my book! I cooked it on low for about 4 hours, shredded the chicken then let it cook a bit longer. The house smelled fabulous while it was cooking too. Thanks for sharing!"
400708,95569,2011-02-19,4,"Well, here's rating #281, and no wonder - this recipe has it all.  Ease of preparation, great flavor (depends on your barbecue sauce, so use a good one that you like) and enjoyed by the whole family.  I made my own hamburger buns from my recipe#445540 and it went very well.  I used a bottled sauce that I tweaked to our liking, cooked the onions with the chicken in the crock pot, and served with jalapeno slices and cheese.  Don't do what I did, thinking it didn't have enough water I added a 1/4 cup to the pot when I started and it watered it down WAY to much as it cooked, had to drain it off and add more sauce.  The recipe is right on as to how to fix this very comforting, fast dish.  Made for Comfort Foods in the photo forum."
371738,95569,2011-02-26,5,Wow!  This smelled fab and tasted great.  Done in my crock in 4 hours.  Thank you.
620763,95569,2011-07-18,5,Great recipe! I used Sweet Baby Rays sauce and cooked on low for 5 hours. I will be using this one again when I need to feed a crowd.
145352,95569,2011-09-22,5,"Perfect! I left out the onions, but the method is great!"
350750,95569,2012-01-13,5,The family enjoyed this dinner and I enjoyed making it because of the effort it took.  Thanks for a great tasty meal.
369715,95569,2012-02-23,4,This was so easy to make and tasted good. My chicken was a bit dry but tasty. I used about 1.5 pounds of chicken and used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce. We thought it could have used more bbq sauce too. Everyone enjoyed this.
198154,95569,2012-08-18,5,Flavor will totally depend on the quality of your bbq sauce.  But this recipe gets 5 stars for when I got ease.  I took my chicken breast right from the freezer and tossed them in the crock pot with the sauce and onion. The house smelled wonderful when I got home from work. I shredded the chicken because it was falling apart.  Next time I may shred it a little sooner so it can really soak up the sauce.
482376,95569,2012-12-22,5,You can't get much easier than this! I had all the ingredients at home and threw everything together in a few minutes. We had a yummy bbq aroma all day and the end result was so tasty. This is a keeper for a quick dinner that will please. Thank you!
2549237,95569,2013-01-02,3,"This was super simple, but just like any other cheater chicken, barbecue sauce, onion recipe.  Not outstanding at all."
92816,95569,2013-01-31,4,"This was tasty,I had too much BBQ sauce in with it and it overpowered the chicken unfortunately."
1179225,95569,2013-02-26,5,Such a simple recipe to have on hand when you want a tasty dinner to come home to without a lot of assembly time. I used bone-in skinless thighs and  served with coleslaw and we really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to trying it with skinless breasts. Thanks for posting the recipe.
333017,95569,2015-04-13,2,"I made up 3 chicken breast ...used my own BBQ sauce and found that the chicken got way to watery and diluted the sauce.  I ended up shredding the chicken and served to DH for lunches!   This is OK, but not worth the 5 star rating"
27643,32844,2002-08-25,5,"This deserves more than 5 stars! This is an incredible tasting dish. Since I have tons of tomatoes in the garden, I used fresh peeled and seeded tomatoes. I made this with whole milk, added a few frozen peas for color, and the pasta we chose was penne. I will definitely make this often. Thanks!!"
101823,32844,2003-10-24,5,"This recipe is similar (alright, almost identical) to one I posted.  (BowTies w/ Sausage, Tomato and Cream)  I had searched the Zaar site for my Bow Tie recipe before posting, but hadn't thought to look for 'Pasta' in the title.  Anyway, this is a favorite of my husband's.  It is quick, easy and has an awesome flavor.  I think that the kielbasa in my recipe adds somthing, but there are many types of sausage to play with.  I recommend choosing your favorite."
7108,32844,2003-11-05,5,"Flavorful and stovetop quick; a nice change from ground beef.  I used Rigatoni pasta and doubled the recipe.  I had trouble thickening the cream sauce (as I always do with other recipes for some reason, a personal problem!).  I've tried this as leftovers and after being refrigerated the sauce is thicker, naturally.  Thanks for posting!"
101034,32844,2004-01-25,5,"Absolutely delicious!! I used hot italian sausage, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written. It's such a quick & easy meal to prepare, but the results are a wonderful tasting meal.  Thanks Ginny"
44383,32844,2004-02-19,5,"Really really good. The only thing I would do differently is add more pasta next time. I used about 1 cup of dried penne but it could easily have used twice as much or more.  Otherwise, Sunday dinner last week was a hit with this recipe. Will do again for sure. Thanks for posting it!"
26512,32844,2004-05-15,5,"This is just an excellent dish, Ginny. I doubled the recipe and I did add quite a bit more garlic. I loved the fact that there was a lot of sauce because we're bread ""dunkers"". DH ate two plates and we really enjoyed it, it was a nice change from the typical spaghetti or lasagna dish. Definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing."
37036,32844,2004-06-04,5,"Great recipe!  DH makes his own Italian sausage, so we normally have a few links in the freezer at all times.  It's nice to find a new recipe to use the sausage that doesn't call for a ""tomato based sauce"".  I followed your directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing... it was perfect!  I served this with a wheat pasta, a fresh salad, brushetta and Bethany's Crostini #88914.  Delicious! Thanks Ginny!"
47559,32844,2004-06-12,5,"Here's another high five for this delicious dish.  I used sweet turkey Italian sausage (our preference), added some green peas, and doubled the recipe.  I also used a ratio of 2/3 cream and 1/3 whole milk.  It took a little longer than the stated simmer time to thicken, but it eventually did.  I'm glad I doubled the recipe - huge quantities were eaten, but I still have left overs for a great lunch this week!   I will definitely make this recipe again."
64934,32844,2004-06-13,5,"Your recipe description ... ""Delicious and satisfying"" describes this perfectly!!  The only change I made to the recipe was to double the red pepper flakes, and I also used hot Italian sausage! Yes, we like things spicy and this was perfect.  I just used plain old spaghetti, but this sauce gave it a whole new taste!  Wonderful recipe, Ginny!  Thanks! "
38643,32844,2004-06-16,5,Even made with fat free half and half this was a hit at my house. A Fast any easy meal which will be made often!
46660,32844,2004-06-20,5,"Delicious!  I used fresh tomatoes, added some basil, oregano, thyme, water, and tomato paste to it in place of the Italian Plum Tomatoes.  I also used half and half in place of the cream, and omitted the oil as I didn't think it needed it.  It was a winner!  I doubled the recipe, and it made MORE than enough for two meals for the four of us.  Thanks for the great recipe, I will make this again!"
35526,32844,2004-08-26,5,"Like you need another 5 stars!!! This is a great dish.  I have made it with bratwurst and spaghetti it was GREAT!  Much lighter then traditional pasta sauces.  Really good Ginny, we will have this often."
59473,32844,2004-09-07,5,This dish was excellent. I couldn't stay out of the pan while the sauce was simmering. I doubled the recipe. I didn't remove the casings from the sausage. I cooked it whole and sliced it when it was done. Thanks for a great recipe.
9869,32844,2004-09-28,5,"Very very tasty, I had been wanting to try this for awhile and last night I got the perect opportunity, I had sausage and cream in the fridge and we all got home late so needed something quick and easy for dinner.
I used penne pasta and as I didnt have the plum tomatoes I just used a tin of chopped tomatoes it was delicious, as a matter of fact Im having the last of it for my lunch right now!
Eve  :)"
8688,32844,2005-03-07,5,"I can't believe I didn't try this sooner! This recipe is so delicious and couldn't be easier to prepare. I made exactly as directed for a scrumptious supper for two. Don't make the same mistake I did, Folks! Do not delay and go ahead and have this for supper tonight!  You will be glad you did ; ) Thanks for sharing this one with us, Ginny!"
95743,32844,2005-03-08,5,Wonderful.  I lightened it a bit with half-and-half rather than cream and spiced it up with hot sausage and both worked just fine.  Looking forward to making this with fresh tomatoes this summer.
173314,32844,2005-03-23,5,"My kids just watched chitty, chitty bang bang....so with the newest voabulary I will just say; SCRUMPTIOUS"
53932,32844,2005-04-30,5,Great recipe!  I didn't change a thing and it was just superb.
97579,32844,2005-07-07,5,"This was wonderful!  I found that removing the casing on the sausage was starting to bug me, so next time, I am going to grill and slice them then add them to the mix.  It is very tasty!  Loved it - Thanks!"
222564,32844,2005-10-29,4,"Real man food, got 10 stars from hubby! Ok, I liked it, too. 4 1/2 stars."
68960,32844,2005-11-14,4,"We enjoyed this.  Very quick and easy to make. Next time I will add more pepper flakes, just personal preference.  Thanks Ginny for posting :)"
251917,32844,2006-03-06,5,YUMMY! I made this in under 30 minutes tonight. I had turkey sausage that I used (sliced in casings). I also had some fresh asparagus in my fridge that I needed to use so I tossed it in. I can't wait to make this again!!
187281,32844,2006-04-13,5,Excellent and definitely loved by my family.  I made my usual substituion for whipping cream:  5 oz. evaporated milk.  It works great and this way I can keep the ingredients on hand without fear of spoilage while living overseas (military).  This is worth of every single star.
222433,32844,2006-09-21,5,Thanks GinnyP! This was really good! Thanks for an easy dinner that makes everyone think your a gourmet chef.
158086,32844,2006-11-07,4,"This was very good, I used half and half so it was not that rich.."
222055,32844,2006-12-11,4,We enjoyed this very much.
146486,32844,2007-01-02,5,We absolutely love this!  I doubled the recipe so we would have plenty of left overs.  I used fat free cream and added some corn starch to thicken it up.  Wonderful recipe that tastes just like take out!
312577,32844,2007-01-11,5,"I can't believe how easy this is to make!  The first bite that I took I said to myself ""I can't believe that I made this-it is so good"".  I did add italian seasoning to the sauce and added more garlic than called for.  I am very happy with this recipe."
80998,32844,2007-04-01,4,This was very good and very easy to make.  I think next time I will add a bit more garlic as we are garlic lovers.  Thanks for a great recipe.
248023,32844,2007-09-19,5,"An incredibly quick, easy and delicious pasta dish.  I had some Italian turkey sweet sausage in the freezer that I wanted to use up and this was perfect. Other than that substitution, I followed the instrustions exactly.  For the pasta, I used the remainder of a bag of campanelle noodles ( just about 6 oz).  When I was folding the pasta into the sauce, I thought it was a little dry, but then again, I didn't know if this pasta was supposed to have a lot of sauce or if it just barely coated the noodles. I was tempted to add more cream but did not.  I am glad I didn't.  It was just perfect.  My BF and I both really thought it was terrific change from our regular spaghetti.  I think next time I will add in a little of the liquid from the tomatoes and add just a touch more red pepper flakes.  We both had a big bowl and there is still enough for 2 more servings.  Just a terrific pasta dish!  We enjoyed it with Recipe #18914... Thanks for a keeper!"
174991,32844,2007-09-25,5,This is a great combination of flavors that blend together with ease.  the only change that I made was to use Alfredo sauce in place of the whipping cream. It's a company dish for sure.
185446,32844,2007-12-31,3,"So many good reviews on this (why I tried it), yet our family didn't care much for it.  We found the recipe to be unremarkable, although the red pepper flakes did add a slight kick--not enough to go for second helpings, though. It needs something else, but I don't know what.  Sorry, GinnyP, to vote with the minority."
242484,32844,2008-01-30,5,I loved this dish and will be making this over & over again!  It is the bomb!
331557,32844,2008-03-20,3,This was pretty good - although not good enough to justify the fat content of the recipe.  I used medium spiced Italian sausage and added 1/2 teaspoon of chili flakes and think it may have been somewhat bland without those slight modifications.  I also skipped the salt and added some pepper instead.  I would make this again although I may try to cut the fat a little by using half and half even.  Thanks for posting.
229850,32844,2008-05-14,5,"This was fabulous and quick. Made it two times before I reviewed it. First time made it with Sweet Italian sausage, then made it with spicy sausage. I must admit, I am a bigger fan of the sweet Italian with the addition of red pepper flakes to spice it up. I think the sweet just has a better flavor for me, but love it is kicked up a little with the red pepper flakes. We loved this both ways,but I think I will stick to the way it is written. Thankyou GinnyP your recipe is fantastic !"
252816,32844,2008-05-30,5,"I used fresh tomatoes,peeled and seeded  and diced,added basil.Thyme and oregano to  the tomatoes..Also used 1 cup of cream,next time I will use 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup cream..Tasted great but didnt stick to the pasta very well. We actually perferred this dish reheated when the suace would stick..Maybe use  mini fusilli next time....Thanks"
140132,32844,2008-06-12,5,"We couldn't get enough of this.  I will repeat this dish often as we all loved it and almost licked the pan clean....lol. I did add a touch more whipping cream but other then that followed recipe.  I served this with a green salad and garlic bread. Thank you for posting, delicious."
280166,32844,2008-08-25,4,"This went together quickly and was an easy weeknight meal.  For those watching their fat, we used turkey Italian sausage and 1% milk instead of cream and it was still delicious.  Thank for posting!"
294000,32844,2008-08-27,5,"Had this in my cookbook to try for a while now.  So glad I did!  It tastes fantastic with the bonus of being very quick and easy.  I doubled, chopping a whole small onion, a pound of sliced sausage links, a can of evaporated milk, and skipped the pepper flakes.  My 3-year-old DD had seconds and thirds!  She also loved helping me make it.  Thank you for a recipe we'll repeat in the future."
470351,32844,2008-09-06,5,"Really, really excellent recipe!  I chose to use hot chicken italian sausage instead of sweet italian.  I increased the garlic, crushed red peppers and onion to almost double each.  In place of the whipping cream I used 1/2 and 1/2.  Followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and it was WONDERFUL!  Even my 2 and 4 year old enjoyed this one (despite my 4 year old saying his tongue was burning - due to my doubling the hot peppers!).  Other that that...PERFECT!  Total keeper here!"
426903,32844,2008-09-29,4,"We liked the cream sauce, but the meat just didn't seem to match. Not sure why. I used green onions instead of regular. I might have to play with this recipe next time. Thanks"
969481,32844,2008-11-08,5,"This dish is wonderful. We have made this several times and the only alterations I make is to use penne pasta in lieu of spaghetti, 3 cloves of garlic and substituted the roma tomatoes for canned â€œfire roasted diced tomatoesâ€� for a little extra zip, just as a personal preference. The recipe is great as posted!"
132383,32844,2009-01-28,5,"My husband and I are trying several new recipes each week and this was on our schedule for this week...we LOVED it!!  Thank you so much for posting this awesome, easy recipe."
439797,32844,2009-02-14,5,This is awesome.  I did everything as directed and tripled the recipe.  There was  alot left.  We all enjoyed it.
189475,32844,2009-08-28,5,"Wow, this was even better than I expected it to be! I definitely would not hesitate to serve this to guests. It looks and tastes like a meal you would get at a nice restaurant. I increased the cream to 1 cup, used fresh shredded parmesan instead of grated, used a can of regular diced tomatoes instead of italian plum, added some italian seasonings, and used penne for the pasta. Another great thing about this recipe is that it cost under $5 to make. I will definitely be making this regularly. Thanks for sharing!"
1072593,32844,2010-01-17,5,Words fail me so I'll just scream----LOOOOOOOOOVED IT!  Made for Alphabet Soup Tag.
269331,32844,2010-02-15,5,"I followed the recipe, except I used canned dice tomatoes drained well.  I used  4 great chicken Italian sausags from a local butcher. This dish was really simple to make, but the taste was fantastic!   Definitely a company worthy dish."
298447,32844,2010-07-12,5,"I've made this a few times now, and seems each time I've varied the recipe a bit.  Nevertheless, it has always turned out great.  The last time I made it, I used half n half, as I was out of he whipping cream.  No one could tell any difference...the dinner table was silent apart from forks grazing plates, slurping noodles and a few ""mmmms"" thrown in for good measure.  It's very easy to prepare and well, even tastes good the next day, if you are lucky enough to have any leftovers.  Served with Recipe #170438 and salad.  Great dish.  Thanks!"
879716,32844,2010-09-10,5,Soooo good!  This is one of the few ways I like italian sausage.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for sharing.
103876,32844,2010-11-30,5,This was so quick and easy and tasted great!  I used chicken sausage and fat-free half & half to make it healthier.  I'm sure I will make again.  Thanks for posting!
928301,32844,2011-03-19,3,"It was good, but tasted like it would've been better with something else.  It either needed more flavor or a different type of meat.  Maybe spicy Italian sausage would've been better."
142367,32844,2011-11-22,5,Easy and very tasty!  I used spicy sausage and it turned out great.  This also reheats well. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
218535,32844,2011-12-05,4,Easy and delicious.
191533,32844,2012-01-10,4,"This didn't WOW me, but my husband loved it. It's basically sausage gravy with tomatoes added!  I don't keep cream on hand, and would rather cut down on the fat anyway. So after step 4, I added 1 Tbsp. butter to the meat mixture. When it melted I stirred in 2 Tbsp flour. Then I slowly added 3/4 cup milk, stirring until thickened. It seemed too thick as I stirred in the tomatoes, but after I added the cooked pasta, the teeny bit of water still on the pasta made it perfect. Add enough salt and pepper and you'll have good flavor."
136997,32844,2014-07-21,5,"Very quick and easy weeknight meal. I used bow tie pasta and subbed in fresh basil, from my garden, for the parsley. :)"
1581225,32844,2017-02-15,5,"I was surprised with this dish. I didn't expect such a simple recipe to taste so great and go down so well with the fam. My youngest son had three servings, which is unusual. Great recipe, and a definite keeper. Thank you!"
198154,32844,2018-09-10,5,"I actually made two separate batches of this for dinnerue to dietary restrictions of family members. The first batch I made with fresh ground mild Italian sausage and gluten free pasta. The second batch was made with whole grain pasta and diced vegetarian Italian sausage. Both times I used a can of no salt diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning, but forgot to drain it when making the first batch. It still turned out fantastic! I also added extra garlic and used garlic salt instead of regular salt. The only suggestion I got from family was one member asked if I could add some more tomatoes next time."
52543,36944,2003-02-06,5,"This was perfect for the Club sandwiches that I made last night & what a great idea about advance preparation. I'll be 1 step ahead for those ""Chef"" and ""Cobb"" salads in the summertime. Thank you!!"
104295,36944,2007-01-08,5,Fabulous method.  I left off the veggies (except onion) and cooked breasts this way.  I made some things with them and froze some.  Worked great.
169969,36944,2007-08-03,5,Great recipe for chicken with a subtle flavor to use for other dishes! My breasts were more then 4 ounces and needed a little more then 15 minutes. Thanks for posting!
132383,36944,2009-02-17,5,We used this tonight to cook chicken for Ro-tel Chicken Spaghetti.  I also had the problem with my larger breasts not cooking completely but it was fine since it was fine since I was baking a casserole for 30 minutes. I will cut the chicken next time.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I then used the broth in the recipe I was making.
470351,36944,2009-12-08,5,"Perfect method!  I would even maybe let mine sit a tad bit shorter next time since my chicken is on the thinner side.  Great flavor, nice and moist.  Used this method to make a pot of chicken soup that called for pre-cooked meat.  Lovely!"
95743,70165,2003-10-10,5,"At our house, the best pizza crust is a thin, crisp-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside crust.  This fits the bill.  It was just the right amount of dough to make two 12"" crusts, the size of my baking stone. If you wanted to make slightly bigger crusts, I'm sure that would work as well.   It rolled and stretched easily and the 20 minute bake time was right on."
37636,70165,2004-01-03,4,"I felt this was a fairly good pizza crust. The dough turned out well where it was pressed thinner, but where directed to be thicker (around the edge), it turned out a bit tough. I would use this recipe again, but keep the dough thinner overall. Thanks for posting!"
91392,70165,2004-03-26,4,"Easy to do.  I used the 1 cup of whaet flour, but found the taste too strong, and would cut back next time to 1/2 cup.  Stetched out pretty well.  I froze half and will be eager to see how it comes out of the freezer.  Nice recipe."
124249,70165,2004-09-08,4,"I made one large crust in a large jelly roll pan.
It made the thickness of crust that I like. It was very easy to make.
I will use this again."
177933,70165,2005-06-10,5,"Great crust!  We didn't prebake the first one and the top was done before the bottom, so we did prebake the second and it was perfect!!  Thanks for a great recipe."
185285,70165,2005-06-25,5,"I've tried 5-9 different 'thin crust' recipes using WWF without luck and this worked great with both WW and bread flour.  Better yet, the dough seems to work *even better* 1 month out of the freezer.  I thawed it in the fridge all day and rolled it out last night for a quick homemade dinner.  *perfect*.  This is a keeper."
29014,70165,2006-06-19,5,"Perfect pizza dough for us!  Not being much of a baker, I needed an easy recipe that I could use again and again - this is IT!  I added a bit of Italian seasoning blend to this and we did our pizza on the grill - excellent, crisp crust.  Plus, a half recipe was good for the two of us, so now I have a ""dough-ball"" ready and waiting in the freezer!  Thanks for posting!!"
140806,70165,2006-08-02,5,"Yum! Instead of making two smaller pizzas I made one with a thicker crust. I think I overcooked it slightly but it still worked out great. I topped with homemade sauce, mozzarella and ricotta."
222564,70165,2007-01-15,4,Great pizza bottom! I did use 1 cup whole meal flour and pre baked the bottom 10 minutes. It turned out really well. Thin and crusty.
359220,70165,2007-03-11,5,"I am now a homemade pizza convert!!!   No more frozen, undersized, overpriced, bland pizzas from the grocery store.  This is only the second time I've made anything with yeast and the first time I've made my own pizza crust and boy was it easy.  I threw everything into my KitchenAid with the dough hook, spread it on my preheated pizza stone after resting , prebaked, then topped and baked it off until brown.  Delish and unique...DH prefers!  I will always keep a batch of this dough in the freezer...Thanks!"
402559,70165,2007-05-01,5,Great crust thanks!
147109,70165,2007-05-06,5,Very yummy!  Thanks!
29782,70165,2007-07-22,5,Most excellent recipe!  I was so proud and very pleased with this dough.  I usually use a bread machine recipe to make my dough up but thought I would try this recipe since I noticed everyone had good reviews. Its very easy to make and is quick too. :)  Love the thin crust it has and the crunchy ends. It was like having a pizza hut thin pizza.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I will be making again :)
180090,70165,2007-10-18,5,"My Mom has made this a couple of times and it has turned out great! We will be using this recipe a lot, thanks for sharing!"
264017,70165,2008-01-30,5,This crust is da bomb! I added 1/2 tsp. minced basil for an herby flavor. Excellent and just the perfect beginnings for a great pizza!
470351,70165,2008-04-12,5,"This dough was excellent.  I did add more flour than the recipe called for during the kneading process since it got so sticky.  Also, when tasting the final crust...the crust alone could have used some seasoning.  However, if you use a super tasty sauce and don't eat the crust alone, you will LOVE this crust.  Another key piece to my success (I believe) is that I used a pizza stone for baking to make the optimal textured crust.  WONDERFUL! I used this recipe along with #114392 (Ultimate Pizza Sauce) and it was superb!!!!"
252816,70165,2008-04-19,0,This is the same recipe that is on my pizza stone box..Makes a nice thin and tasty crust..I add 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the mix..Wonderful pizza with recipe#114392 pizza sauce..
125640,70165,2008-05-28,3,"Goes together easily. I opted for the cup of wheat flour and kneaded the dough and let it rise in my bread machine. If I make this again, I would try roasted garlic olive oil in it because I think it would add to the flavor which was very neutral which is nice in a way because it would go with a lot of different sauces and toppings, but the flavor just wasn't really anything special for all the rave reviews. It has a very crispy texture, maybe a little too crispy. I think either the cooking time is too long or the oven temp is too high as I tried pre-baking as directed in step 14 the first time I tried this, and the dough was basically done (very done in a couple of spots where the dough was stretched a little thinner - so I turned the oven down a bit after I put the toppings on), but as nobody else seems to have had that problem, maybe it's just my oven. Thanks for sharing anyway."
847160,70165,2008-05-31,3,good and eazy to make
218535,70165,2008-09-29,4,My dough is very sticky when I used 2 1/2 cups of flour. Definitely needs more flour but otherwise very good pizza dough.
158086,70165,2008-10-27,5,Wow this recipe was a life saver.  I had a boboli crust I was going to use but it had expireed 12 days ago...so I made this one instead...turned out great....now I wonder why I bother buying the boboli?  This was so simple..
103876,70165,2008-11-10,5,Perfect pizza dough!  I made it in the bread machine and then let rise again on the baking sheet for about 15 minutes before pre-baking and then baking with toppings.  It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I made four small pizzas - one for each member of my family - each with our own choice of toppings.  Thanks so much!
358796,70165,2009-01-26,5,"Usually do it in the bread machine or Kitchen-Aid but this was easy! Results great! Firm, crisp & yummy crust. Made the whole wheat version. Will use this again and again."
140132,70165,2009-03-24,4,Oh yummy.  I love thin crust pizza and this is a good recipe for it.  We made two pizzas and both turned out good.  I had no idea it was so easy to put a homemade crust together.  Thank you for introducing me to a new favorite.
969481,70165,2009-04-11,4,"Very good! I followed the recipe as written, even baking it for the 10 minutes on a baking stone before putting on the toppings. I also brushed the rolled out raw dough with melted butter and sprinkled with garlic powder. Perfect for our Friday night's pizza party's!"
126440,70165,2009-05-19,5,"I have used this many, many times, I can't believe I haven't done a review.   This is just what we love.  Easy to do and makes two so you can use later in the week or freeze."
400420,70165,2009-08-02,5,"Well, my hubby just said to me ""you need to make that pizza again - it was good!"".  I have never been very good with yeast, and this time was no different.  I put it in the cup of water and no foam.  I had already decided if this happened, I was going to use it anyway, and to my surprise, it actually rose pretty good.  I'm not sure if it turned out the way it was supposed to, but it was nice and crunchy.  I just made one pizza and froze the other half.  I used Recipe #279060 and topped it with sliced mushrooms, red onions and fresh spinach.
I'm very happy that I have another crust (and sauce, too) in the freezer for another meal very soon.  Thanks!"
579298,70165,2009-10-25,5,"Great base recipe! I actually used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup ground flax seed, and 1/4 wheat germ. Thank you for posting!"
1072593,70165,2009-11-11,5,"Silly me, after about five minutes into eating this I had the incredibly strong urge to speak Neapolitan.  Can you guess why?  Made for Alphabet Soup."
60260,70165,2009-11-15,5,"Great crust and I loved the short rise time.  We make pizza most every Sunday and I decided it was time to experiment with some new recipes.  The dough was a little sticky when kneading and I added quite a bit of flour but after the rest, it rolled out like a dream.   I bake in a 475-500 degree oven on a pre-heated pizza stone.  The pizzas were done in about 12 minutes.  Tasty!!"
55729,70165,2009-11-18,0,"I made this and forgot to review it, which is why I don't remember the details. However, it did not work out for me."
146047,70165,2010-01-09,4,I really liked this crust! Next time I'll add more salt (more like 1-2 tsp) and let it rest for 10-15 min prior to putting the pie in the oven. Thanks for the recipe!
318235,70165,2010-02-16,3,"This didn't really work out for me. I guess with all of these great reviews I probably made a mistake, but I double checked the ingredients and the dough just didn't have much flavor. It also never got to the smooth and elastic part, and the crust was kind of hard when cooked. Thanks for giving me something new to try!"
1133190,70165,2010-03-03,4,"This was a pretty good recipe.  We used 1/2 c. wheat flour.  I think the amount of sugar to put in the water should be included in the ingredients. I used 1 tsp.  I agree with others that there wasn't a whole lot of flavor to this crust, adding some spices would help I'm sure.  I will say of all the pizza dough we've made this was by far the easiest to roll out into the crust!!  I bet we'll be trying this again - this time maybe adding some garlic to the dough."
101823,70165,2010-04-13,5,"I have had very poor experiences with yeast, and was quite gun-shy of homemade pizza crust. This recipe worked well even for a flop like me. Even my discriminating husband approves."
637486,70165,2010-06-07,4,"The only reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because I was really hoping for the crust to be more ""cracker thin"".  I made mine as thin as possible and baked it about 10 minutes before topping it.  I thought that it had a great flavor.  I doubled the recipe and it made enough for 2 large pizzas."
145352,70165,2010-08-31,5,Perfect. I used it to make 2 pizzas on the grill.
532289,70165,2011-01-10,5,Very good.  Made as directed.  Will make again.
187373,70165,2011-02-20,5,"Great crispy crust!  I did use the cup of whole wheat flour and a little extra salt.  I did have to add extra flour---kneaded using Kitchenaid mixer and was still a little sticky.  It did press easily into the pan.  I accidentally overcooked the pizza, but was till tasty.  And I have another one in the freezer to go along with the homemade pizza sauce there as well. I know it doesn't need another review, but thanks for posting/adopting this recipe!"
124190,70165,2011-03-25,5,"Excellent recipe that gave great results. Nice thin, crispy pizza dough that held up to major toppings. I did prebake like the instructions said. I topped mine with chicken, tomato, onion, and mushroom. No trouble with it. Thanks for sharing, and we will definitely use this again."
1179225,70165,2011-07-05,5,Great crust! I replaced about a 1/4 of the flour with whole wheat and would do that again next time. The crust held up really well. Thanks so much for posting!
456858,70165,2011-10-23,4,"This was my very first time making homemade pizza dough.  My dough came out a little ""sticky"".  I am guessing I didn't add enough flour, for fear of it being too dry.  I did go ahead and make a pizza, and I think the dough tasted good.  I will def make again, (probably next weekend) and try using at least 3 cups of flour rather than the 2 and 1/2 cups posted.  I also did pre-bake the crust as mentioned in recipe.  My pizza came out thin, which I like, but it was also very crispy..too crispy.  As I mentioned, I will make again, making some adjustments, like not pre-baking the dough first, hoping it won't be as crispy."
2041603,70165,2011-10-29,5,"Just made this dough for pizza and it is spectacular! No complaints from the group. We precooked and made two large pizzas the size of my pan (made two batches of dough). It was easy to make, easy to work with, and tasted great!"
176615,70165,2012-07-17,5,"Worked well! Doubled the recipe, made two pizzas (one was recipe #70951) and froze two balls of dough for later. Next time I'll remember to prebake the crust when using a 12 inch pizza pan. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
839492,70165,2015-07-02,5,"Excellent. I subbed 1 c. wheat flour for 1 c. of the APF and no one noticed! This will be my go to crust recipe from now on. Nice thin crust pizza; quick &amp; easy to put together. Thanks for sharing!
***Update*** I made this dough to take with us camping and we loved it. I made the dough at home and placed in a Ziploc bag (double batch; froze one and chilled the other). Brought pepperoni, shredded pizza cheese &amp; purchased pizza sauce. Placed a pizza stone on the grill until hot (lid closed), rolled out dough, placed on stone &amp; topped as you normally would, closed lid and waited for perfection. We had this 2 nights for dinner (out of the 3 nights we stayed). Will definitely make this again and again. I also want to try making it into cinnamon buns or some kind of yummy breakfast pastry. Thanks so much for sharing!"
1581225,70165,2017-06-03,5,"This was a good pizza crust. I made cheese, pepperoni and meat pizzas. I could have made it a bit thicker on the edges, but it was still good."
76951,64446,2005-05-11,5,Loved it!  I brought it to work for a carry-in and got rave reviews.  Both loaves were gobbled up quickly.  I followed jjhon's advice and brushed egg white on twice.  It browned beautifully.  This is a definate keeper!
145352,64446,2006-01-04,5,Great!!! I brushed with some olive oil before baking.
1072593,64446,2015-09-08,5,"263 reviews!!  You review hogger, you!  Well deserved."
39835,64446,2006-01-08,5,Wonderful bread! Perfect with Rosemary and Lemon Pork Stew recipe#116382. Will definitely be making this easy bread again soon! Thanks for sharing!
140806,64446,2006-01-08,5,Excellent! 10 stars! I have always loved Macaroni Grill bread and now I can make it at home. I found that I needed more flour and next time I will use fresh rosemary instead of dried. This was a recipe of firsts for me: first time making bread at home and first time using my dough hook on my new stand mixer. Bravo!
93006,64446,2006-09-06,5,"To die for....we gobbled it up.  Being a person who sometimes doesn't read closely, I threw everything in the bread machine and let it go through the first rising there.  Then followed the recipe from there - absolutely terrific results!  Will make this one again and again!"
177933,64446,2006-10-19,5,"My first attempt at bakind bread from scratch and it was a really good recipe to start with.  So easy, however my yeast was a little expired so I know it didn't raise properly, but it still tasted great.  I will try it again with fresh yeast.  Thanks!"
231054,64446,2007-02-25,5,"I agree with so many of the other reviewers -- this was fabulous!  The dough was so easy to work with -- I used my Kitchenaid with the dough hook.  I could have probably added another tablespoon or two of flour -- the dough was very soft.  But once it was baked, it was just so soft and fluffy.  I only used the one tablespoon of rosemary -- I didn't sprinkle any additional on the tops of the loaves.  After brushing the butter on the top of the loaves, I sprinkled a fair amount of very course kosher salt on the loaves.  We really enjoyed this bread -- and look forward to making it many more times in the future."
187373,64446,2007-04-13,5,"WOW!! This bread was really delicious! My husband and I absolutely love the bread at Macaroni Grill and am so glad to have found this recipe! It is so good and really dead on, although less salty and greasy than at the restaurant.  DH and I ate both loaves in less than 2 days. I used dried rosemary (about 2.5-3 teaspoons).  I had to add quite a bit more flour when I was kneading, but overall, this bread is pretty easy to make. Next, I just have to learn to adapt it to make in my bread maker! Thanks so much for one our new favorite recipes!!"
394077,64446,2008-05-09,5,"My goodness this bread is good.   I made 5 rolls/buns and used them as hamburger buns.  Instead of butter, I used olive oil.  I also brushed 1 egg white on the buns before  and during baking as suggested. The crust is brown and slighty chewy and the crumb is nice and soft and the flavor is fantastic."
426903,64446,2008-06-06,5,"I didn't have enough time to make it as instructed, so I threw all the ingredients into the bread machine, and it turned out pretty good. I think next time I will definately make it the way the directions tell me too. I also only had dried rosemary, so I will be looking forward to trying it with the fresh stuff next time. Thanks for the recipe."
140132,64446,2008-08-04,5,This was fantastic.  I took advantage of our fresh herbs in the garden and this bread turned out so good.  We dipped it into olive oil dipping sauce and my whole family devoured it in minutes....yes I said minutes....lol.  Thank you for posting this delicious bread.
307214,64446,2008-10-20,4,"Really good.  When I was making this I assumed that it would serve the 10 people we had for dinner.  Image my surprise when I formed the loaves and each was the size of an large bun!  Thankfully it rose lots, but it only made a slice or two per person."
969481,64446,2008-11-24,5,"This was very good! Just like the restaurant, if not better. We used some olive oil, garlic powder and Italian seasoning as a dip for the bread. Yum! Even the kids enjoyed it. Thanks for posting!"
218535,64446,2008-12-30,3,I guess we didn't like rosemary. Sorry.
808027,64446,2009-03-04,5,My family said this was better than Macaroni Grill's bread.  I sprinkled a little sea salt over the top of the bread and was generous with the rosemary but it did not overpower.  This is a keeper!  We'll be making this regularly at our house...what a find!  Thanks for posting!
315055,64446,2009-08-28,4,"Very good, everyone that tries it loves it, but I think it's a little too heavy on the rosemary.  Next time I will omit the ones sprinkled on top, and half the amount in the batter.  Thanks for sharing!"
46660,64446,2009-10-18,5,"I can be fairly critical of ""copycat"" recipes if I know what the real thing tastes like and it doesn't match. I LOVE Macaroni Grill's bread, and this to me tastes almost exactly like it! The only thing I did differently was that I used Herbes de Provence instead of just rosemary, because after making the dough I discovered I was out of rosemary!

It just came out of the oven about 10 minutes ago and one loaf is gone already between me and four boys. I don't fancy myself as being the best breadmaker, but this recipe sure made me feel like I was! Thank you so much! I will make this again, and again, and again!!!"
1179225,64446,2009-10-24,5,"This bread is delicious. I used Penzy's pasta sprinkle instead of rosemary. I topped it with egg & sea salt. It was easy, flavorful, and beautiful to look at. Thanks for posting this great recipe. I'll be using it often."
520150,64446,2010-01-29,5,"We really enjoyed this.  I brought it to a dinner party, so made it into small rolls instead of the loaves.  But I am looking forward to making it again.  Thank you very much for sharing this lovely recipe.  It's a keeper!"
620763,64446,2010-02-18,5,"Delicious! We all loved this bread and it does taste like Macaroni Grill's, but it does not rise like theirs. Beware this dough is extemely sticky and gluey. It was all over my hands and very hard to work with when I transferred it to the baking sheet, but it does turn out well! I used the entire 2 1/2 cups of flour and was tempted to add more because of how sticky it was, but I didn't.  My kids loved this and I will definitely make again."
810787,64446,2010-09-19,5,"I tried putting the egg white on top as another reviewer wrote and the top was still soft. Next time, I will try no butter or egg white brushed on. The flavor of this bread was excellent. It tasted just like Macaroni Grill's."
1122161,64446,2010-10-16,5,This was fun and easy to make...and delicious! Thanks for posting!
199020,64446,2011-01-19,5,Very close to the real thing! I brushed mine with butter and sprinkled garlic salt and Italian spices on top and served it with Macaroni Grill Chicken Marsala over angel hair pasta. I will definitely be making this again!
400708,64446,2014-09-02,5,"I made the dough in the bread machine and then shaped, allowed a 2nd rise and baked in the oven.  Sprinkled the top with the extra Rosemary and sea salt and it turned out great.  I love the flavor of the Rosemary and  the salt gave it an extra flavor that we enjoyed.  Next time though I think I&#039;ll use the egg wash instead of the extra butter as I like the shine I get from that.  As an update:  Continue to use this awesome recipe, my family likes it served with a dipping sauce of olive oil and balsamic vinegar with Italian herbs.  Never a piece left over"
894666,64446,2016-03-25,5,"Made in the bread machine with active dry yeast, just dumped all the ingredients in. Used the entire amount of flour off the bat. The last few minutes of baking I spread the butter on top and sprinkled on some sea salt and it turned golden brown. Baked on a pizza stone. Wonderful! Couldn&#039;t have been easier!!"
37868,31371,2002-09-04,5,"Bev This is so much better than the ones I cook.
I use bacon grease....The butter is so much better. I used to put the onins in at the last.
Nope no more this is the way I will do the squash we love so much. Thank You for new and wonderful ideas with our favorate foods."
27643,31371,2002-09-12,5,"Bev, this was delicious! We loved the buttery taste the squash gets. It gets cooked, but not too soft. This is a simple basic recipe with a minimum of ingredients, yet it could be on the most elegant table! We used the salt and pepper and also a sprinkling of paprika for color. Thanks for a recipe I will use often!"
74652,31371,2003-08-24,5,This was delicious!  I love veggies (especially squash) and this turned out wonderful!  So easy to make. The butter and the onions are perfect with the squash without overpowering it. This will be one of our regulars when yellow squash is in season! Thanks for the great veggie recipe!
43083,31371,2004-01-13,5,"Even my PICKY father said it was good! How simple is this??? My goodness, thanks for a new simple side dish. And for my family, adding something new to the dinner table is a feat in itself. All of us give it 5 stars!! EASY to fix too!"
53932,31371,2005-04-21,5,This is the way I often make summer squash and it is very good.  Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best.
35526,31371,2005-06-27,5,I used margarine and Vidalia onion.  This is a great basic recipe and PERFECT as is.
49304,31371,2005-08-16,5,"Great recipe,tasty, easy to make. Love the buttery taste. I used Zepher squash which is a yellow summer squash with green on one end. I have a lot of them in my garden along with other squash. I will be making this tasty recipe again,SOON."
52262,31371,2005-09-05,5,This squash was so good that even a couple of my kids ate it.  I tried to make the recipe a little less fattening by cutting the butter amount but it didn't taste right.  I ended up adding more butter to get to the 1/4 cup.  The results were great!
37036,31371,2006-01-31,5,"Bev, I enjoyed this dish so much!  I used to hate squash as a kid and recently tried it again a few years ago and liked it.  I love your recipe, it's so easy to prepare and tastes great!  I'll be using your recipe often.  Thanks for another keeper!"
126104,31371,2006-05-29,5,"This is sure not how I fix(ed) my squash, at least not until today.  These are the same wonderful squash that Thalhimers' Richmond Room used to serve, and we had them a few times a week.  I've missed them, but they will absolutely be fixed weekly from now on.  Thanks, Bev, for a simple and delicious way to enjoy my squash."
29782,31371,2006-06-01,5,"This is how my Great Aunt Minnie would make fresh squash and new onions grown from the garden. It was a favorite in the family.
The key is cooking it softly and not over browning it. We love the favor of the onions sauted lightly in the squash. Thanks so much for sharing a old family favorite. "
222055,31371,2006-06-24,5,My dad gave me some squash from the garden. Somehow I knew this would be good! Thank you!
222970,31371,2007-01-23,5,"Very good. Yellow squash has replaced zucchini as my summer squash of choice! I don't usually cook it so long, but this is a wonderful way to cook yellow squash."
298447,31371,2007-04-24,5,"For me, this dish is a wonderful taste of southern-style home cuisine, reminding me so much of my mom's cooking.  I might have moved away from the South, but I feel right back at ""home"" every time I prepare this. If I have it on hand, I will usually add bacon drippings for even more added flavor, but it tastes great without.  Thank you!"
89831,31371,2007-09-12,5,"Delicious! I and added in some fresh garlic with the onion and threw in some Parmesan cheese at the end, so good, thanks hon!...Kitten:)"
394077,31371,2008-01-31,5,Very easy and very good.
242484,31371,2008-04-17,4,Enjoyed this squash.  I made a mistake and added a little olive oil to the butter and it made the squash too oily.  I will follow your recipe exactly next time and do the butter only.
125640,31371,2008-07-13,4,"Very easy side dish. I added a little garlic powder and a pinch of sugar at the end. This would also be good with zucchini in place of some of the yellow squash. In fact I think I would prefer it that way next time. I served this with baked chicken, and it made for a nice meal. Thanks for sharing."
353131,31371,2008-07-15,5,This is the way I cook my squash except I add lemon pepper salt instead of plain salt &pepper.  It is heavenly.
229850,31371,2008-07-15,5,"Love this, it is so simple and good. My niece was in from NC and she told me to try using green onion in place of the reg onion and it was great !! My sister has a garden so I had plenty of the squash and green onions from her, and we really enjoyed this dish. Thank you for posting !"
32058,31371,2009-05-22,5,"I could eat the whole dish! I typically use about half the butter, to cut the fat.  Otherwise it is sinfully delicious!Thank you for posting!"
333017,31371,2009-12-17,5,"I have made something similar to this....only I cut down on the butter by about 2T and add about 1/4 parmesan cheese at the end.  Once the squash almost cooked, sprinkle with parmesan cheese, take it off the heat and cover.  Let it sit for about 5 minutes to melt.  Yum!!"
176615,31371,2010-01-17,5,"Delicious, quick, and simple. The perfect way to fix squash. I could eat only this for dinner and be happy. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
198154,31371,2010-06-06,4,We made this using a garlic salt and pepper blend for the salt and pepper.  (We put garlic on just about everything) It was a great way to use up a summer squash.  Thanks for a great side.
373817,31371,2010-07-08,5,"Sometimes the most simple recipes are the best!! Everyone, young and old, loved this!!"
264017,31371,2010-07-21,4,"I'm new to the world of cooking squash as I didn't grow up eating it, but was curious enough to try this recipe. I cut the ingredients in 1/2 for 2 of us. I followed the directions to cook for 20 minutes, and mine came out quite mushy, but very delicious! Looking at the photos, I think I'll cook it for maybe 15 minutes next time to preserve the shape. Very tasty and so simple!"
369715,31371,2010-07-21,4,This is good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written.
265954,31371,2010-11-02,5,"Bev, I can't go wrong when making one of your recipes. While I am not the world's biggest fan of squash, this recipe made me get up for seconds. My only change was to omit the salt, and me and my usually-salt-loving husband didn't miss it at all. Wonderful recipe."
928301,31371,2011-03-19,5,I wanted more.  It was great.
914720,31371,2012-05-24,5,"This was delicious.  I used just one tablespoon of butter for three small squash.  I cooked it until it was nice and browned.  My son, who hates every kind of squash, ate it without complaint, and my husband and I loved it.  Thanks for posting."
145352,31371,2012-06-27,5,Perfect! I received some squash from a co-worker and whipped this up. Nice to have everything I needed.
350750,31371,2012-08-30,5,"This was great, scaled it down to fit our family.  Thank you!"
529278,31371,2012-10-15,5,"Simply delicious!!  I used a mix of yellow and green squash and added a couple teaspoons minced garlic.  I couldn't believe how fast and easy this is.  It's not much more effort than opening a can of veggies, it just takes more time."
218535,31371,2018-08-24,5,"Delicious, even for folks who do not like squash"
4470,30358,2002-06-08,5,"I used this with Fettuccini for three persons and it was perfectly cooked, added sundried tomatoe pesto sauce right after I drained the pasta into the pot put the lid back on and presto perfect pasta no muss no fuss - of course I added some parmesan when serving.  Thanks Margaret for a real no watch recipe that works"
27643,30358,2002-06-08,5,"Thanks for the great idea!! I made spaghetti using this method. It came out perfect. I was worried it would stick together--NOT! It was just great, freed up a burner, and NO steam in the kitchen! How in the world did you discover this??
Thanks a lot, will always do it this way!! :-)"
13483,30358,2002-06-30,5,I don't believe this.  When I first tasted the pasta I thought it was not cooked.  I then realized I've always overcooked pasta and was now enjoying it the way it should be!!  I'm sold and this is how I'll always cook pasta now.  Thank you very much Margaret3.
37868,30358,2002-07-11,5,"It Works! It Works! Doing happy dance.! *SMILES*
Nothing to change about this. Tryed and True.
Thank You"
44383,30358,2002-07-30,4,"I tried this the other night with linguini and was less then impressed.  I let it sit 15 mins as directed but pasta was still clumpy and not done in places.  I expect it's a trial and error sort of thing and for all that, I might as well make pasta the way I usually do.  Great idea though, just was a little disappointed it turned out iffy... hubby was skeptical it would even work and I only proved him right and I HATE it when that happens! ;-)"
47559,30358,2002-12-30,5,I tried this with a pound of fettucine and it was perfectly cooked.  What a great tip.  Thanks for sharing.
9869,30358,2003-01-21,5,"Had to try this after reading all the great reviews, I used farfalle pasta and after the 15 minutes had a perfect al dente pasta. Thank you for posting!"
32772,30358,2003-01-27,5,"Tried this for my spaghetti dinner tonight. Wow, I don't have to worry about the pasta boiling over and then trying to clean off my glass stove top. Thanks for posting."
43083,30358,2003-12-31,5,Cool! Thanks for a great idea:) I made 6 oz of spagetti at 12 minutes and it was perfect. I will use this alot now so I can spend time making sauces.
35526,30358,2004-09-23,5,Perfection.  Solving the age old problem of loosing track of how long the pasta been cooking!!!!!  You're a genius!
29014,30358,2004-10-06,5,"Add my name to the list of skeptics that did not believe this would work until I tried it - perfect!!  Even though heating up the kitchen is not really an issue here in Wisconsin, this method is still so much easier.  I did plain old spaghetti and I didn't even have to stir it!  Thanks for posting!!"
176615,30358,2004-12-24,5,"It's perfect pasta, what else can I say that hasn't already been said? I made penne and thought it would stick or clump, it didn't! A great way to cook pasta without salt or fat. I always hard boil eggs this way and after reading the other reviews, will try rice with the same method. Thanks so much, Margaret3!"
59473,30358,2004-12-27,5,It doesn't get any easier than this. I tried this method tonight with spaghetti and it turned out perfect. 15 minutes was just right. I will be cooking all my pasta this way from now on. Thanks for sharing.
64934,30358,2005-01-22,5,"Well, there's not much more I can add to all these wonderful review!  It's hard to believe how perfect the pasta comes out!  I used penne pasta and let it sit for 15 minutes and it was perfect!   Now I don't have to listen to the smoke alarm go off every time I cook pasta!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
135887,30358,2006-03-05,5,Absolutely perfect - works like a charm!
136997,30358,2006-07-23,5,"Works like a charm! I've had trouble cooking pasta just right in the past, but not anymore. Thanks so much for posting this gem. :) "
132764,30358,2006-11-25,5,Clearly I'm way behind on my reviews. I've been using this technique for probably a year or more. I've also taught others to do it as well. Makes things so much easier. No more boil-overs! I do adjust the time depending on the thickness of the pasta.
362983,30358,2006-11-29,5,I love this! I was a bit too eager and probably should've left the pasta have an extra minute or two since it was a little thicker (I'll be more patient next time!) but I love how easy this was. I especially loved that I didn't have to constantly check on it as well. I don't think I'll go back to the old way again!
52125,30358,2007-01-04,5,"Wow when I saw this recipe I really had doubts that it would work, but it did work. I really was impressed with this recipe and I will be using it lots more. Thanks Margaret3...."
373817,30358,2007-01-10,5,Amazing! This is the only way I will make pasta from now on! Thanks!
74281,30358,2007-07-15,5,"I have used this method 4 times now... on Spaghettini, Linguine, Penne, and Mostaccioli and it works like a dream EVERY time! With the Mostaccioli it did appear that it was stuck together when I took the lid off, but after draining and stirring, it was not stuck a bit. I will never cook pasta any other way!!!"
529278,30358,2007-09-27,5,"I'm shocked and amazed.  This really works!  We had the best spaghetti noodles we have ever made.  I have already shared this with 2 people and intend to share it with as many others as I can.   I worried about the bottom of the pot, but there was absolutely no sticking.  We will use this with other pastas, after we figure out how long thicker pastas take.  Thanks for the amazing tip!  By the way, I had the spaghetti leftovers the next day, and they warmed up fabulously!  They didn't get at all dry or sticky and were just as good as the night before.

I also tried this with a box of Velveeta Shells and Cheese.  It worked perfectly again - and it was so nice to not have to watch that pot!  I'm always boiling things over and didn't want to do that on our new stove - I'm glad I tried it and I will do this every time!"
248023,30358,2007-10-04,5,"I tagged this recipe months ago but always forgot about it when it came time to make some pasta.  Finally, I had a chance to try this technique out so I could make Recipe #39087.  I ended up using angel hair pasta since that was all I had in the house.  I let the pasta sit in the pot for 4 mintues and it turned out perfectly.  I can't wait to try it again with different types of pasta.  I had no problem with it sticking at all... this would be great in the summer months when it gets quite hot and humid here in Atlanta!  Thanks for a great tip!"
60260,30358,2007-12-27,5,"I decided to try this when entertaining family, but figured if it didn't work I could always cook up some more pasta.  I used whole wheat thin spaghetti and went for it.  I set the timer for the time recommended on the box and it worked perfect.  It was a dream not to have water running down the walls and not having to worry about it over boiling, etc.  Same theory as the ""seen on tv"" pasta cooking containers - no need to buy those!"
632249,30358,2007-12-28,5,Go figure...this works great! I remembered reading this recipe earlier and decided to try it one night when I was running all over doing too many things at once. The pasta was done perfectly and I was able to finish other chores at the same time. Thanks a bunch!
68960,30358,2008-01-14,5,"Wow, what a great recipe! My kitchen gets so hot and we really do enjoy our pasta so this method for us is awesome. Thank you for posting."
400708,30358,2008-02-02,5,"Worked like a charm with my Linguini pasta last night.  Thank you so much for posting.  I did have a hard time with this as my DH was SURE it would not work and kept opening the lid to check it - telling me ""we've GOT to cook it more""  Was he surprised when it came out perfect even with all his interuptions.  Can't wait to do this again WITHOUT his help."
333017,30358,2009-05-02,5,"Update:  I have since tried this method with pasta and I wouldn't go back to the old way again!  Super easy, perfect every time!!!April 14/2009:  This method could be applied when making soup. Once the soup is finished, I add the pasta and remove it from heat. It sits there (uncovered) and is cooked in about 10 minutes. Great idea!"
369715,30358,2009-07-07,4,"I needed a pound of macaroni for another recipe so thought I would give this a try. I used Dreamfield pasta and followed the recipe exactly. The pasta did cook up nicely but mine did stick some. I will be trying this with other pastas. This was such a time saver for me as I made the pasta, set it aside and made other things for dinner. When the timer went off, I was able to use the macaroni. I didn't have to sweat over the pot or stir it. I will be using this method in the future."
844554,30358,2009-10-31,5,"I saw this on here one day and thought I'd try it.  I like the fact you don't have to keep stirring it. I used penne pasta and agree with Ransomed by Fire -- next time (and this will be the only way I cook pasta anymore) I'll try it for 10 minutes. Mine was a little more cooked than we like it. All in all, I love this idea!"
768828,30358,2010-05-12,5,I just tried this with macaroni.  It turned out great.  I will be cooking my macaroni this way from now on.  Thanks for such an easy way of cooking macaroni - with no boiling over.
131021,30358,2010-07-10,5,It was really hot the other day and the air conditioning was doing its best so I thought I would give it a break and make my pasta this way. I used a whole wheat fortified rotini and this worked great. I forgot and left it on the burner just turned it off and it still worked out great. I will do this from now on. Thanks.
1179225,30358,2011-02-18,5,Perfect!
653438,30358,2011-06-01,5,What a great idea!  I tried it twice.  First with elbow macaroni and then with tiny shells which took less time to cook than 15 minutes about 7-8 minutes.  I did add a little oil and salt to my water before adding the pasta and everything worked out fine.  Sure will be nice to free up a burner on busy occations.  Thank you.
52543,90674,2005-07-04,5,Great French toast - as good as (or better) than Denny's! TIP: Mix the cinnamon into the vanilla before adding to the egg mixture - it won't float on top. Thanx for posting Earnhardt!
37305,90674,2005-11-16,5,"Absolutely wonderful French toast!  We agreed that it was the best we ever had.  I made as directed, except added the cinnamon to the vanilla and it worked like a charm.  I did have a bit of a problem whisking the flour lumps out, but they ended up being tiny and didn't make a difference.  I used homemade amish white bread (Recipe #26526), sliced about 3/4 - 1"" thick and was able to get 9 slices out of the batch.  Served with bacon , sausage and of course syrup!  Thanks sooooo much for posting this...I will use it again and again!"
173314,90674,2006-03-11,5,Excellent!  we all loved. Used regular bread and made about 7 slices.  Thanks so much.
199792,90674,2006-11-08,5,"Wow! I never have used flour in French Toast before. It makes quite a difference. The pieces are so nice a crispy. I found it a bit sweet for my taste but my husband pointed out I did have it covered with syrup (the yummy,home-made variety). However, I do think I will decrease the sugar a bit next time. I am thinking this may be on the table Christmas morning. Thanks for the wonderful recipe."
173579,90674,2006-12-01,5,This was fantastic.  The best french toast we have ever had.  I used regular bread and it was still great.  Thanks for posting such a fabulous recipe.
36944,90674,2007-05-14,5,"This is so quick, so simple and so delicious!  I made mine using french bread and I halved the amount of the dipping mixture.  It will cover 6-9 slices, depending on how long you let them soak.  I used a whisk to mix my ingredients and it blended perfectly.  Thank you for sharing this scrumptious recipe with us Earnhardt!"
52262,90674,2007-05-31,5,My kids and I loved this french toast recipe!  I used skim milk instead of whole and it worked great.  I also used light butter instead of real butter.  I got 9 pieces of french toast with the recipe using Texas toast.  This is my new French Toast recipe!
37779,90674,2007-06-07,4,"A straightforward, uncomplicated french toast recipe which yielded great results. My family enjoyed this very much. Thanks for posting."
39301,90674,2007-06-10,5,Perfect french toast.  Thanks for posting!
92816,90674,2007-07-01,5,"Excellent french toast.I changed the recipe a little to suit my needs.First of all I halved all ingredients and it made enough for 4 pieces of bread,possibly even 5.I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of white...using that really made the difference,so tasty!In addititon to the syrup and powdered sugar I sprinkled the finished toast with toasted chopped pecans,almonds would be great also.Very good recipe!"
168462,90674,2007-08-19,5,My entire family loved this recipe. I made it exactly as written except I used regular bread not Texas cut. It was perfect. I would not change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.
132383,90674,2007-09-07,5,We liked this recipe a lot...it was easy.  I was a little concerned about the chunks of flour so I ended up putting everything into my bullet/blender to make sure it was was mixed well.
579298,90674,2007-09-09,5,Mmmmm! I cooked it on honey wheat - and it turned out great :) 70 positive reviews doesn't lie! Where have you been all my life? Thanks Earnhardt#3
229524,90674,2007-09-23,5,Great flavor!!! Started with butter but it keep getting to brown evan though I turned it down.  Swithced to oil and that helped.  Put the Toast in the oven at 200 to keep it warm and that helped it to be firmer. Thanks for sharing:)
58836,90674,2007-10-14,5,"Made this yesterday for breakfast.  Didn't have any texas thick bread, only regular but it was just as tasty.  It was just me so I scaled it down to one serving.  Thanks, I'm sure I'll make again."
371738,90674,2007-10-27,5,"Made this French toast this morning and I gotta join the reviewers before me in giving it 5 stars.  The thing I like the most about this is that you don't need the powdered sugar, butter or syrup on top.  They are great just as they are.  My 4 y.o. ate three slices without anything on them - just like finger food to go."
8688,90674,2007-11-15,5,"This is a great recipe for French Toast!  I cut extra wide slices of recipe #71373 to use in place of the Texas Toast and topped the finished product with recipe #265593 and real Canadian Maple Syrup!  The flavor was outstanding! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Earnhardt!"
347822,90674,2007-12-02,4,Very good basic french toast recipe.  My only recommendation is to sift flour and sugar to prevent lumps. I served the toasts with a mix of cinnamon and sugar.  Thank you for a great breakfast recipe.
368078,90674,2008-01-05,5,"This recipe is by far the best french toast recipe ever!  We've made it twice so far.  The first time we followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, we cut our texas toast into 1 inch strips and made french toast sticks.  We also used 1% milk the second time, as it was all we had on hand.  It turned out tasting just as good as using whole milk.  This is the only recipe we will use from now on when making our french toast."
125640,90674,2008-01-10,4,"Very good, and easy to make. I halved the recipe and there was enough batter for 4 slices of toast. Next time I would reduce the sugar by half as it was a little too sweet for me, but really good other than that. Thanks for sharing."
50969,90674,2008-01-27,5,"I had been wanting french toast for quite sometime now,and Queenkungfu recommended this one.And I'm so glad she did :).Since it was just me eating this I cut the recipe in half,but next time this is made only 2 pieces of Texas Toast will be used.I don't do syrup,so it was left off.The taste was exactly what I was hunting for.Thank you for posting,and ""Keep Smiling :)"""
229850,90674,2008-01-28,5,"The family loved this, thanx for posting!"
177933,90674,2008-02-01,5,Great french toast!  I mixed the all dry ingredients first and then added the wet.  I had no trouble with the cinnamon.
119466,90674,2008-02-02,5,"Although I didn't try this myself, I made it for my husband and son and they loved it. (They can't compare it to Denny's, though, since they haven't tried it there.)  I used thick-cut French bread, rather than Texas toast. I did have a problem getting the flour to incorporate into the batter, even though I whisked it briskly, but the small lumps remaining didn't seem to affect the outcome. Next time, though, I think I'll combine the ingredients in a different order, and if that doesn't help, I'll just use the immersion blender. In any case, they both thought it was delicious--thanks for posting!"
402559,90674,2008-03-09,5,"I made some Cinnamon Sugar Bread last night so I could use that for my french toast, they complimented each other VERY well. Thanks, will make again."
227607,90674,2008-04-04,5,This was wonderful!!! I finally found a loaf of texas toast(that was not in the freezer section) and made this for my family this morning.  It turned out wonderful.  I had some fresh strawberries so I chopped them with a little sugar and put on top of the french toast and put a dollop of whipped cream on top.  The kids absolutely loved it.
331557,90674,2008-04-26,5,"I will add to all of the rave reviews for this.  I made a really tasty and dense bread in my machine the night before (Recipe #257116) and used it for the toast in the morning.  I halved the recipe and got four very large slices out of it and had none left over.  I also used 1% milk as that is all I had.  My boyfriend, who isn't fond of french toast, said it was far and away the best he has ever had and I can make it more often so long as I use this recipe.  Thanks for posting!"
250031,90674,2008-05-19,5,"Wow! This doesn't need any more reviews but WOW! We loved it! I fancied it up by making a cream cheese topping (using a pumpkin roll filling) and sliced bananas. My daughters LOVED it! They said ""make this again and make it soon!""  Thank you!"
447123,90674,2008-05-29,5,"Ok I was not feeling well last night so I told everyone they were on their own for dinner. My daughter asked if she could make some french toast. So we got this recipe and she went to wrok. WOW this was easy and very yummy. Definently a keeper. Thanks Earnhardt!!!
I have made this more times than I can count! Many times I have had to use skim milk because I had no regular milk. Still turned out super duper great!!"
111291,90674,2008-06-15,5,"Yummy.  Made just as posted except I used light whole wheat bread and it was perfect!  I mixed everything together and hand whisked it and that worked well.  Thanks for posting what will now be my ""regular"" French toast recipe."
316717,90674,2008-06-28,5,great recipe! thanks for sharing!
207176,90674,2008-08-24,5,My son had this at a friend's house and made me get the recipe!
485151,90674,2008-10-08,5,This was very good- the kids loved it this morning. I enjoyed it plain without powdered sugar or syrup. I took another reviewers tip and mixed the cinnamon with the vanilla and that solved the clumping problem I've always had. I did have problem getting the flour mixture to mix well with the eggs though. But it didn't affect the outcome at all. Oh- and I doubled the recipe and used a whole loaf of texas toast and had quite a bit of egg mixture leftover.
80998,90674,2009-02-01,4,Very yummy!  A nice french toast recipe.  I have never seen flour in a french toast recipe.  To be hoenst I amnot sure it is nessary.  This french toast has wonderful flavor.
470351,90674,2009-03-14,5,EXCELLENT!!!  Followed this to the letter and used home made french bread as the bread base.  Kids devoured it!  Will definitely make this one again!
222433,90674,2009-03-20,5,The whole family enjoyed this!! Thanks for posting!
426903,90674,2009-03-29,5,Very nice recipe. I used fat free milk and it turned out great. Thanks for posting.
226863,90674,2009-04-12,5,"Very good french toast recipe!  Like other reviewers stated, be careful not to let your griddle or skillet get to hot.  With the sugar in the coating, they are quick to burn.  This was a very enjoyable weekend breakfast.  Thanks for posting!  Made for Chef Alphabet Soup Tag."
529278,90674,2009-05-07,5,"I've never made French toast before.  I got the hang of it after the first couple of slices. It didn't get eggy on the outside, and while moist inside, it wasn't soggy.  Loved the powdered sugar on top.  Use skim milk, and it was fine.  I think I'll use more cinnamon next time.  Definite family pleaser!"
312577,90674,2009-05-08,5,Perfect french toast recipe.  I didn't have the texas toast bread as I am on vacation right now and bread is so expensive here.  But I followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  We topped with real butter and hot syrup.  Amazing.
124190,90674,2009-07-07,5,"This was really good. To combat the flour lump problem other reviewers had mentioned, I added the flour about a teaspoon at a time, whisking continually. I also used the suggestion of mixing the cinnamon in with the vanilla to dissolve it first. I have never been able to get cinnamon to incorporate in french toast batter before trying that. It worked perfectly, and I did not have lumps in the batter. I used sourdough french bread, and I would not recommend this as it left a tang that my kids did not love, and I wasn't overly crazy about. I will try this again with regular french bread. VERY good recipe that I will use from now on. Thank you for sharing!"
1122161,90674,2009-08-10,5,"This was sooo good! I was a bit worried though when the flour seemed to lump up when mixing, but it cooked up great. I don't think I've ever had french toast this good! Thanks!"
280166,90674,2009-09-13,5,I made this recipe this morning but used the cinnamon-sugar technique of Recipe #294481 Snickerdoodle French Toast because we like the crispy coating.  Not sure what the flour added but surely didn't take anything away.  We love french toast and this recipe was no exception!  Thanks for posting!  PS - this made enough custard to coat 8 slices of Texas toast.
68460,90674,2009-10-28,5,"We've never had french toast at Denny's but we loved this recipe!  I was in a hurry and didn't measure anything, just estimated.  I'm pretty sure I got it right because our breakfast was fantastic this morning.  Thanks for the recipe :)"
140132,90674,2010-01-13,5,"I made this for my family last night for dinner.  We really liked it and will repeat this recipe often.  I loved the texas toast in these, perfect.  Thank you for posting."
172369,90674,2010-04-28,5,"I had a piece left after everyone had eaten and took a bit, yum, cold and old and still delicious, I love this... Thanks for sharing."
265954,90674,2010-05-09,5,"Wonderfully easy recipe.  I make breakfast food for dinner whenever we're running low on supplies.  I made this at 8 pm as a late-dinner whim and am glad I did.  The hint of vanilla is delicious.  I skipped the powdered sugar, as the syrup is sweet enough.  Thanks!"
1133190,90674,2010-05-27,5,"Wow. Really, really good! Thanks so much for posting! I actually used whole wheat flour and it was a great substitution I think!"
1269015,90674,2010-06-16,5,"I made this with 2 Tsp flax seeds instead of the eggs, and served buttered and dusted with powdered sugar. It was a *huge* hit! I may add some nutmeg next time, and serve with sliced fruit as well."
222564,90674,2010-06-23,5,"As good as fresh donuts, less hassle. We have made these for countless times by now."
131021,90674,2010-07-16,4,"I thought that this was good, not great. I had to use the mixer to get rid of the flour lumps and I wish it had more vanilla and cinnamon. I didn't really taste a difference using the flour and sugar."
1506604,90674,2010-11-21,5,"PERFECT!!! I usually have something to add or change but the measurements were perfect. I didn't have texas toast so i used wheat bread and it still came out great. Note: two slices of regular bread is equal to 1 texas toast. I couldn't even taste the sugar, which is great but I'm wondering if i need it then?"
126440,90674,2011-11-27,5,Excellent French toast.<br/>I used Recipe #408880 for the bread and Oh My! <br/>Wonderful.  DH kept saying how good it was and<br/>loved the flavor with the cranberry.
187373,90674,2013-12-01,5,"Tasty french toast! We really like it with some specialty bread, something chewy. But tastes good with some thick Texas toast as well. Haven&#039;t gotten around to freezing any yet, but one day..."
176615,90674,2012-07-03,5,"Great! For no lumps, mix dry ingredients, add milk and vanilla and mix until smooth. Mix in eggs last. The kids gobbled this up. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
540346,90674,2013-04-15,5,This french toast was awesome!  I am surprised that my kids didn&#039;t rave over it as much as I did.  It was plenty sweet; in fact it didn&#039;t need any extra powdered sugar or syrup in my opinion.  Very delicious!
894666,90674,2015-06-07,5,"This is my favorite french toast recipe, I can see why it has so many 5 stars! Today I mixed Kahlua in place of the vanilla (I was out) and it turned out great. I&#039;ve always mixed the cinnamon and vanilla together first before adding to the other ingredients and that ensures the cinnamon is distributed evenly through the batter. Makes exactly 12 pieces of Texas Toast (pretty much the whole loaf of Texas toast)."
1581225,90674,2016-11-09,5,This is a great French toast recipe. It was easy and tasty. Will keep this as my go-to.
95743,87075,2004-04-03,5,"Loved this sandwich!  I'm from the midwest but have never had this sandwich and boy have I missed out.  Dh went absolutely nuts for it.  Really, really good and so quick and easy.  After browning the ground beef I let it drain for quite a while so the end result was not the least bit greasy.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It's perfect."
76951,87075,2004-05-02,5,"These were VERY good!  I made them last night for my son & myself since my husband was out of town and I knew the snob in him would turn up his nose.  I used the 2 tsp of salt while frying up the meat but did not add any more at the end of the cooking time.  We also used mustard and dill pickles on toasted buns, but I think the meat tasted wonderful all by itself (sampled some when cleaning up leftovers).  I will make again - maybe I'll even try to convince my husband to try them!  Thanks, Plantfreek!"
229850,87075,2007-06-04,5,"We really liked these! How simple and tasty! My DH hates mustard, but he did eat these also. I just left off the mustard on his bun. Thanx for the history of this sandwich, I wish I would have had a cast iron skillet to make them in and see if there was a difference in taste, would love it even more I bet."
133174,87075,2004-05-21,5,"These were wonderful.  DH and I really enjoyed them.  I didn't put in the amount of salt called for because I think they would have been salty.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and will do so again.  Thanks for posting."
101034,87075,2004-05-25,3,"We thought these were ok. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but they just didn't work for us."
26512,87075,2004-06-02,5,"We actually did *love* these little sandwiches! I was pretty skeptical, but I didn't change a thing...I wanted the real deal. I'm so glad I didn't! I did serve these with a slice of American cheese, but added the pickle and mustard. We ate them with some crispy parmesan potatoes -- DH ate three of them! Great little sandwich, super cheap and it doesn't get any easier to experience a unique bit of Midwestern history. Thanks for sharing this recipe ;)"
55578,87075,2004-06-22,4,"We haven't had loosemeat sandwiches before (except Sloppy Joes).  They were good.  Nothing fantastic but a nice change.  I liked the flavors and since it was so easy to make, I'll make it again.  By the way, the recipe was beautifully written!"
121185,87075,2004-07-16,3,"ok...maybe I'm just not a loosemeat kinda girl....But, this wasn't a big hit with us.  It was good, ok even...lots of pickles did the trick.  The 3 yr old picked at it, the 11 yr old said it was  ""blah"" and the husband said it was just ok."
103876,87075,2004-09-27,5,"I made these tonight and everybody loved them!  I was really hoping this recipe would live up to the expectations set by all the great reviews and it certainly did.  I must admit that I used lean ground beef and didn't add any extra fat.  I'm sure they would have been even better if they were a little greasy, but my body didn't need the fat.  I will make these often.  Thanks for posting!"
176615,87075,2004-12-23,5,"My family really enjoyed these simple, quick sandwiches, even the ultra picky 3 year-old, and my husband wants to make sure I keep the recipe handy so we can have them again soon. I made mine with lots of mustard and pickles as suggested and they were very tasty. Really good as is but I'll cut the salt to a teaspoon next time. Thanks, plantfreek, for posting the wonderful recipe as well as the story behind it!"
172369,87075,2005-01-15,2,"From reading the reviews you love it or dislike it.  If you have white castle in your area, that what it was like, only crumbled up. This recipe is not for us, It must be a regional thing. Thank you for sharing."
140132,87075,2007-02-08,5,"I have never had loosemeat before, but am sure glad we tried these.  My family wasn't sure they would like them since they are used to their usual ""sloppy joe"".  I told them to give these a try, and lo and behold they liked these better!
I doubled the recipe and we had none leftover.  I served them as suggested and don't think I will ever change that.....Stephanie"
98919,87075,2007-04-26,5,"Okay, just add another 5 stars for me.  Made these tonight for my family and 3 grandkids.  The baby ate the whole thing in nothing flat and my VERY VERY picky grandson actually ate a whole one...it was slow going but he ate it and didn't look like he was going to be sick with every bite! lol  My DS & DH and I loved them too!  I toasted the bun and ate it with mustard and pickle..just as suggested......DELISH!! (I love old-fashioned recipes such as this one!) Thanks for sharing.....it's a keeper."
357358,87075,2007-04-29,4,"I made these for my construction crew yesterday. Not one of them had ever had a loose meat sandwich so I was taking a big chance. Without exception, all seven people thoroughly enjoyed these sandwiches. They were even taking *two* when refilling their plates! Thanks for sharing."
125640,87075,2007-05-31,3,"I followed this recipe exactly. It was quick and easy to prepare, but the flavor just didn't do it for us. DS thought it had no flavor. I thought it did and that it was well balanced and all (not too vinegary or salty or anything), I just didn't care for it that much. Thanks anyway. It was worth a try."
128473,87075,2007-08-09,5,"This is really nice comfort food. We really enjoyed this sandwich. It was the first time we ever tried loosemeat but it won't be the last. Very tasty, the dill pickle and mustard mix really well together, it gives the sandwich that extra little something. Thanks for sharing Plantfreek"
199792,87075,2008-04-09,4,This is a nice change from a sloppy joe which we like a lot. My husband liked them equally well. I enjoyed the subtle sweetness along with the mustard and pickles. It makes up very quickly which is great for a weeknight meal. They are a bit difficult to eat as the meat falls out of the bun. I guess that is all part of the fun! I am sure this will find it's way to our table again. Thanks for sharing your recipe. This was made for Spring PAC 2008.
37036,87075,2008-10-09,3,"After all the great reviews, maybe I was expecting too much or perhaps it's a regional thing, but my family and I did not care for these.  I followed the directions to a T.  I first took a bite of the plain sandwich and it was too bland.  So, I added mustard to the bun (didn't have pickles) but it only helped a little. The recipe was well written and I really wish we would have liked these.  Thanks for posting."
353131,87075,2008-10-11,5,"I have read this recipe a dozen times and debated whether or not to try it as I have three picky little ones. Decided to go for it. Made homemade burger buns. Served it just like is suggested with dill pickle slices and extra mustard. DH,my 10y/o,8,y/o, and I fell in love!!! The wild thing is my 8y/o hates mustard and won't try anything with it!! We talked her into trying a bite and she was in love. My 9y/o son wouldn't touch it but I really didn't expect him to. What a great and easy recipe. Will make often!!!"
377039,87075,2008-11-04,5,"Plantfreek, I must apologize for not trying the recipe just as written the first time making it -- I used a mixture of diced steak and diced bacon instead of ground meat & fat, and I served on a french loaf spread with a little garlic butter and warmed in the oven, before adding the mustard and such.  This was really very good, and I think it'll be even better made directly to specifications, as it was a little greasy with the diced bacon in it.  I will be trying this again just as directed.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
158086,87075,2009-02-02,5,I tripled this recipe for our superbowl dinner party and they were a big big hit....We served exactly as the recipe said....
1122161,87075,2009-03-26,5,"I remember seeing these on Rosanne and thought who would eat that! Well, when I came across this recipe and after reading plantfreek's enthusiasm over these I had to try them.  What a surprise! I made exactly as directed, and they were delicious! The mustard and the pickles really add great flavor to these. So weird, but very tasty!! Thanks for the recipe."
178742,87075,2009-04-20,5,"I am very very suprised I had not rated this, and I've made it at least twice in the past 2 years. My husband and myself really enjoyed this. I got a big hoot out of it, because I could not believe there is something this plain and simple out there. I knew it would be sooo good! Only thing I did differently the 2nd time is go with 1 teaspoon instead of tablespoon of sugar. I loved this recipe, takes me back to a different time.. that I was not in, but read about!"
532289,87075,2009-11-06,4,"Made as written.  They were pretty good.  I was expecting a bland pan fried ground beef taste.  The mustard, vinegar, and sugar really give the meat a pleasant taste.  My husband thought they were just okay and compared them to taco meat.  This would be  a good quick meal when you are short on time or low on money.  Thanks for sharing."
355637,87075,2010-01-07,4,This is really good. Loved it with lots of pickles!
168462,87075,2010-01-15,5,Excellent. Thanks for the recipe.
914720,87075,2011-03-28,4,"These were a nice change from our regular sloppy joes.  I had to use a nonstick skillet, and didn't need the additional Crisco.  Used toasted buns, and served with chips and veggies and dip.  Thanks for sharing."
203325,87075,2013-02-05,5,"10 stars!  These are so unbelievable good!!  We have a drive up diner in town that serves loose meat sandwiches and these taste just like them.  They are called ""zip burgers""!  I always get a cheese zip with ketchup and pickle.  They close Nov-March, so now we can get our zip fix in the dead of winter.  Thank you so much for posting!"
2549237,87075,2013-02-25,4,"This was a simple, very good sloppy sandwich.  My husband ate 3 and I had two.  The only person who didn't really enjoy this was my picky 2-year-old.  I will make again."
37779,87075,2013-06-09,5,"Add me to the list of fans of this sandwich. I&#039;ve never been to Iowa, so never had the real thing. My husband has raved about loosemeat sandwiches for years and I remember their appearance on &quot;Roseanne&quot;. Followed the recipe exactly and used a cast-iron skillet. Toasted the buns, spread with mustard, topped the meat with dill pickle slices. Everyone raved. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Already have requests to make it again."
368078,87075,2015-07-01,5,Excellent!  Made just as directed and toasted the buns.  Will definitely make again!
59473,35775,2003-05-15,5,This was delicious. There is only two of us so I halved the recipe. I had some leftover ham in the freezer from Easter. I was looking for a new recipe to use it up. Glad I found this one. I will make it again and try both bacon and sausage. Thanks
64934,35775,2003-05-21,5,"Made this for supper tonight exactly as the recipe stated (using sausages), and cutting the recipe in half. It was awesome!!
DH loved it and had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.  Thanks for sharing Gramma!!"
149363,152441,2006-01-20,5,"Well I was looking for a different way to prepare carrots and saw this was recently posted. WOW!! Delicious! I love the addition of the brown sugar and ginger, they go together great with carrots. I will be making this one again.
Thanks Mama!"
169969,152441,2006-01-26,5,These are wonderful!!! I love the flavors! It is as if ginger and brown sugar were invented just for carrots!! Thanks Hope for a fabulous carrot recipe!
89831,152441,2006-01-29,5,These are just delicious! I increased the brown sugar slightly. Thanks mama!...Kitten:)
278113,152441,2006-03-03,5,"I was leary of the ginger when I first read this recipe. But, with all the rave reviews I had to see for myself. And it is REALLY good!!! I will never make them any other way again! Thanks for a fantastic recipe."
138429,152441,2006-11-06,5,  We loved these carrots. I do like ginger and the balance of the ingredients was perfect. So very easy to make and  with  such great flavorI served them with pork chops and  brown rice. They will be a great addition come holiday time. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
222055,152441,2006-11-30,4,I made these for dh as a quick side for his work lunch (Spam and mustard sandwiches). He loved them and said they complimented the sandwiches well. He also said it made carrots much more enjoyable to eat. I love how easy they are to cook and I used the microwave suggestion of another review to steam the carrots. I let dh do the rating as I am not the carrot lover. My little one still preferred them raw. Thank you mama's kitchen !!!
126104,152441,2006-12-02,5,"I totally enjoyed these.  Not only were they simple, but delicious.  I might try fresh ginger the next time, because I love an intense ginger flavor, but these are a winner just as they are.

I just upped the stars.  I saved a small amount of these and reheated them after 3-4 days.  I liked them even better.  I had them tonite with just a simple pot pie."
142559,152441,2006-12-03,4,"Fantastic carrots! Served at a Christmas party and they were a hit! I personally don't care for carrots, but did find these very good!  Super easy to make - no baking! LOL! I steamed these and then tossed in the sauce."
59473,152441,2006-12-19,5,These carrots were great. The ginger added a nice flavour. Like another reviewer I cooked them in the microwave. Thanks
394077,152441,2007-01-08,5,Delish and so easy to do. Thank you mama for the recipe
359220,152441,2007-01-31,0,"I think I need to rate this without stars, as I left out the ground ginger (I think mine wasn't up to par).  But boy or boy, you can't beat tender carrots with brown sugar and butter...I think I ate this entire recipe myself over a day or two!!!  Yum!"
58836,152441,2007-04-17,5,"Yum, I love carrots and these were very good.  I didn't add the ginger and they were just as good.  Thanks, I'm sur4 I will make again."
227607,152441,2007-05-25,5,Made these for ZWT 07...The kids loved them and want me to make them again tomorrow.  Very yummy way to get the kids to eat their carrots.  I think I used a little more brown sugar than called for.
231054,152441,2007-05-29,5,"So simple, but so, so good.  I didn't double the sauce -- but I think I was a little short on the amount of carrots I used, so it worked fine.  But if I have the entire pound of carrots, I think I'll do as others suggested and double the sauce -- it's certainly yummy enough to have double the amount!!!"
324621,152441,2007-05-30,4,These were pretty good. Made them to go with our steak and shrimp dinner along with some seasoned pasta and fresh honeydew melon. Very nice meal and these carrots were a lovely addition!
265954,152441,2007-06-08,5,"Do yourself a favor and try this recipe.  So delicious, quick and simple, and leaves your kitchen smelling like the sweet scent of ginger.  Note:  sugar burns quickly, so be sure to heat the sugar over low heat and stir often.  Thanks for posting."
74652,152441,2007-06-29,4,This is the way my Mother always made carrots and now the way I make them.  Always a must on the Thanksgiving and Easter table!  Thanks for sharing!
103876,152441,2007-07-01,5,Very good carrots!  This recipe is simple to make and the flavor of the sauce really compliments the carrots.  I used baby carrots and fresh ginger.  My daughter was still eating the leftovers after dinner was over.  I think that's a good sign!
140132,152441,2008-01-26,5,My family loved these. What a great idea to add the ginger.  I feel that is what makes this dish so special.  Its that wow factor.  Thank you for posting this simple side dish that is sure to please....Stephanie
250031,152441,2008-01-27,4,Family liked them! We don't eat carrots much but everyone liked these so I'm adding them to the family menu.
13483,152441,2007-10-17,5,Excellent veggie dish.  I made the dish a day ahead of my dinner party and just gently nuked it to warm it up.  Worked like a charm.  Added a nice colour to the plate and a good taste to the pallet.  Thanks for the post mama's kitchen.
305531,152441,2007-12-06,5,What can I say that hasn't been said already? These are really yummy and were the star of our dinner last night. I steamed the carrots ahead and heated them up right before dinner. Thanks Hope for a wonderful new side dish.
8688,152441,2008-01-18,5,"Delicious simple and easy to put on your table!  Thanks, Mama's Kitchen!"
191533,152441,2008-02-05,5,"Superb! The flavor is great! I like a thicker sauce that sticks to the carrots, so I blend in a little mixture of cornstarch and water after the other sauce ingredients. Delicious; thanks for sharing!"
68960,152441,2008-02-09,4,These are nice.  Easy to make and went well with our lamb shanks. My brown sugar didn't melt that well even though the pan was low.
369715,152441,2008-03-12,4,These are good and easy to make. I used canned carrots as that is all I had tonight and needed a quick side dish. I followed the recipe as written. Everyone enjoyed these. Thanks for a different way to make carrots.
389431,152441,2008-04-07,4,"Good down home kinda flavor. Sweet, but not candied...  you could still taste the carrot! I will be using this one again! Thanks!"
377581,152441,2008-04-21,4,"These were nice for a change!Easy to make and tasty. A subtle change to the usual carrot taste. I felt there was too much glaze, so next time I'll reduce the butter and sugar by half, but keep the ginger just as is. Thank you for such a simple flavorful recipe! I'll be making these again."
125640,152441,2008-07-19,3,"Simple sweet, buttery side dish. If nothing else, good basic microwave carrots. Incredibly easy to make in just minutes without taking up space on the stove. I thought they tasted pretty good. DH didn't like them, but we both prefer raw carrots anyway. Thanks for sharing."
55578,152441,2008-12-18,4,Good!  I like the addition of ginger.
768828,152441,2009-01-25,5,"I love these carrots.  I've made several times and can't belive I didn't review.  I usually use Smart Balance instead of butter, but are still really good.  Thanks"
362983,152441,2009-02-04,5,"Yummy! I always use carrots with other vegetables, so it was nice to use just carrots and make something very simple yet tasty at the same time! I sliced my carrots and sauteed them till they softened. A bit of water helped them along as well. I think I'll probably add more ground ginger next time since I think I added a touch less than recommended, or try fresh ginger for a nice little kick. I might microwave the carrots next time like other reviews have suggested and see how it compares time-wise. Hmm maybe some honey instead of brown sugar.. or even some herbs. Oh the possibilities.. :) Thanks for a lovely recipe!"
158086,152441,2009-11-15,5,These were excellent carrots..I used splenda brown sugar and will be making these for our annual family xmas dinner at our Uncles...They will go perfect with his ham...thanks
329638,152441,2010-01-16,5,Very tasty!  Kids loved it. Thanks for posting!
653438,152441,2010-01-23,5,I saw this recipe this morning and just had to say I fix my carrots this way quite often only I use some fresh grated ginger...DH and I love these!  Thank you for posting.
1365025,152441,2010-01-28,5,"These are so good. I steamed my baby carrots first and then finished simmering them in this delicious sauce. I'm just cooking for one but I always make enough for two meals, shame on me but I ate all the carrots in one meal, that's how good they are."
173579,152441,2010-03-23,5,These are very tasty carrots and so easy to fix.  My family just loved them.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
333017,152441,2010-04-01,5,I have made something similar to this but used mustard instead of the ginger.  I quite liked the ginger/butter combination. I made this up the day ahead of time...undercooked the carrots a bit and placed them in the crockpot for about an hour.  Loved it!!  I will definately use this recipe again!!
355637,152441,2010-04-29,3,These were pretty good!
50969,152441,2010-06-20,4,"UPDATE On 6/20/10: I've made these carrots so many times and can't believe I've never posted a photo. Well, I've made these again and here's the photo. And I have to say they are just as good if not better than the first time they were made. My first time to review this recipe was November 3rd,2006
I just want to say that my SO and I really enjoyed these carrots very much.I thought that the ginger and brown sugar gave the dish that ""something special""that is usually missing from carrots.These will be made again,Thank you for posting."
74281,152441,2010-11-16,5,"These are definitely delicious carrots and SO simple to make. I used a bag of baby carrots and just threw all of the ingredients into a pot with 1 cup of water. Then I brought it to a boil, covered the pan and reduced the heat to a simmer. I simmered the carrots covered for 15 minutes and then uncovered for 10 minutes until the sauce was reduced. My 80 year old Dad looked at the plate and said: ""CARROTS? YUK!"" I told him to just try 'em, and he did.... He then requested seconds!"
928301,152441,2012-04-27,3,It was ok.  Needed to try to thicken the sauce on the heat a bit more.
1581225,152441,2012-07-29,4,Very sweet and tasty.
486718,152441,2014-05-22,0,Yummy way to make carrots!  Thanks!!!
176615,152441,2015-01-07,5,Really good. Super fast and easy to fix. Thanks for the recipe!
198154,152441,2015-03-08,3,"I made these for DH, as is the only one who likes cooked carrots in our house. He gave them 3 stars. He said they were &quot;okay&quot; and &quot;not bad, but not his favorite.&quot; Lots of leftovers."
218535,152441,2017-10-15,2,too sweet
101034,35775,2003-11-11,5,"This was great!!! I only had bacon, so that's the meat I used. Next time, I will use the sausage and I know it'll be even better tasting. I made it for dinner the other night and we enjoyed it very much. The leftovers were really good too. Thanks Gramma."
64642,35775,2004-02-12,5,We really enjoyed this one.
73469,35775,2004-08-26,4,"This was a good recipe ,but not great. I didn't like how the layers were. I believe it would be better if you mix all the ingredients together. With the layers it tasted like you were eating three seperate things. "
146486,35775,2005-12-01,5,We had this the day after Thanksgiving for brunch and it got 5 stars from all 11 of us there.  I used 1 lb. of sausage and had to use canned tomatoes since that was all I had.  Turned out great though and unfortunately there were no leftovers :(
60260,35775,2006-01-01,5,"I lost my breakfast casserole recipe and turned to this one for our New Year's brunch today.  Great recipe!  I used the Hashbrowns that had the onions and peppers already in it, added the extra fresh onion and left out the pepper and used combination of bacon and diced ham for the meat. About 1/2 way through the baking time I loosley covered it with foil because my meats were looking a little overcooked.  Once covered with cheese I baked uncovered. I will make this my new permanant recipe.  Thanks!"
347822,35775,2006-12-02,3,"Good and easy.  Prepared most of it the  night before, next morning added eggs and cheese.  This round I used chopped ham, next time, I will try bacon or sausage.  Used just onions and tomatoes, no peppers. I think the sausage will give it more flavor.  Textures were great."
8688,35775,2006-12-26,5,"Wonderful!  I made this for breakfast the morning after Christmas and it was enjoyed by all!  This is a very flavorful breakfast casserole chocked full of lots of wonderful vegetables and I used some leftover ham from our Christmas dinner.  The only thing lacking in this recipe is salt and pepper which is easy enough to remedy. I served this with a platter of English muffins and orange slices with bananas, orange juice, hot chocolate and coffee.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Gramma Connie Verbeck :)"
394077,35775,2007-03-17,4,Quick and easy dish.  Served it for brunch and it was a success.  I used diced potatoes.  The next time I will shred the potatoes instead.
529278,35775,2007-08-21,3,"This was easy and looked very pretty.  However, the peppers were still crunchy.  I also forgot the salt and pepper, but that's my fault.  I'm going to try it again some time, and I think I'm going to saute the peppers and onions first, to be sure they will get cooked all the way.  Even after being in the oven for almost an hour, there was a layer of runny stuff that came out  when I cut into it.  I hope it was cooked all the way."
373817,35775,2008-01-02,5,I made this for a New Year's Eve brunch and everyone loved it!! This is my new go-to breakfast casserole! :) Thanks!
447123,35775,2008-02-16,5,This was a very easy and very good dish!! I brought it to my MOPS group and there was NONE left!! IT went over very well. ANother great thing about this is the potential it has!! You can add more or less of somethign and make it your own. Thanks GRAMMA for a GREAT recipe!!! ?You ROck!
140132,35775,2008-08-04,4,I made this for brunch a few weeks ago and we all liked it very much.  I really liked the fact that brunch was in one pan.  I will repeat this recipe many times.  Thank you for posting.
426903,35775,2008-12-20,4,Very tasty casserole. I followed the directions and even left it in the oven a little longer than stated. It still turned out a little runny. The taste was phenomenal but some of my guests were a little turned off by the liquid. I think next time I will cut down on the eggs. Hopefully that will help. Thanks for posting.
969481,35775,2008-12-20,4,Very good. There was a fair amount of liquid in the bottom of the pan. I think next time we make this we will thaw out the hashbrowns before we make it. I have a feeling that is what causes the excess liquid.
198154,35775,2009-06-02,3,We all agreed that this would be great if the hashbrowns would crisp up a little.  Next time I may try precooking the hashbrowns a little before putting this together.
32058,35775,2009-10-12,3,"I would rate this as a bland as well.  It needs a kick.  I served this to weekend guests and although it was eaten, it wasn't devoured and raved about.  Pretty basic without any WOW factor.  The kids wanted no part of it, pancakes won out hands down."
60989,35775,2009-12-27,5,"Made for Christmas breakfast, preparing the night before. Made it a snap to finish in the morning. I used bacon and O'Brien hashbrowns (onions and peppers already included). Greatly enjoyed by all. Thanks!"
158086,35775,2010-04-18,5,I cut this in half and made for my DB birthday breakfast as he loves breakfast....this was a big hit...will remember recipe for future brunches and it was so easy and tasty.
1122161,35775,2010-07-20,5,"This turned out great! I baked 1/2 recipe in a 9x9 inch pan. I baked in the time stated, and it didn't turn out watery for me as some have said. There are so many possibilities for this recipe but the basic is really delicious. The only thing I might change the next time is to defrost the hashbrowns as I think they may turn out more crispy that way..but I ain't complaining, it was really good! Thanks for posting!"
126440,35775,2010-10-03,5,Great breakfast.  I cut the recipe down for four and used freshly microwaved potatoes then cooked them in the butter for 10 min before adding the veggies and ham.  Baked 40 min. added the cheese and that only took three min.  Have leftovers for breakfast this week.
236170,35775,2011-11-28,5,"Loved this! I've tried other recipes that use hashbrowns instead of bread and they always ended up a bit waterie, but this was perfect. I used green pepper instead of red, but everything else was as written. Thanks!"
1179225,35775,2011-12-25,4,"This came out pretty good. I'm not sure I liked the soft potatoes. I would have liked them to be a little crispy. Also,I think I would leave the tomato out next time. They were a little watery. I loved the ease of this dish and I think you could easily mix it up depending on your own tastes. Thanks for posting this recipe. I'm looking forward to making again."
540346,35775,2011-12-26,3,This was just okay for me.  I sprinkled salt and pepper on the potatoes and on the eggs and I still thought it needed more and lacked flavor.  We did find that it was a little better the next day.  I think I will be looking for a different breakfast casserole recipe.
173579,35775,2012-03-10,5,Very good casserole.  My DH thought it was superb.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for posting.
191533,35775,2013-11-29,5,"We LOVED this, breakfast-for-dinner! I made half a recipe for two of us, and this was the main dish, with fruit on the side. The half recipe would have fed 3 people, I think. Although I realized I didn&#039;t have 6 eggs- made it with 4. Was still delicious. I baked it for longer than specified, and even so the peppers and onions were crisp-tender, which I thought we wouldn&#039;t like. But we did! Great flavor! (Oh, and I added about 1/2 tsp. chipotle seasoning and 1/4 tsp. smoked paprika to the eggs.)"
177933,131018,2006-10-19,5,Made this for Monday night football and it turned out great.  Thanks!
135887,131018,2007-02-18,2,Finished product tasted like BBQ sauce.  Sorry - not a favorite or worth the 18 hours.  Maybe my shoulder roast was bad but I did follow the recipe to a T so can only base my review on that.
847160,131018,2008-11-29,3,that was ok and eazy but for a 18 hours cooking i was expecting better ...
236170,131018,2007-06-11,5,This was soooo good!! It was really easy to make too. I put it in the crockpot at night and in the morning my husband shredded it. We left it in for another hour and then put it in the fridge until dinner time. There's  only two of us so we have a ton leftover - but that's ok - it'll freeze. It's so yummy!!
265954,131018,2007-11-25,4,"I tweaked and this came out great.  I used a 2 and 1/2 pound pork roast (rib, no bone), one large onion, one Cubanelle pepper, and 20 oz. of ginger ale.  I cooked for 10 hours, let sit in its juices for 2 hours, and then shredded the pork, added 18 oz. of Jack Daniels Honey BBQ sauce and cooked for one hour.  Delicious.  Thanks for posting."
359220,131018,2007-12-30,5,"DH and I both agree- this pulled pork rocks!!!!  I've always wanted to be able to make good pulled pork and thought it would be too hard and time-consuming, but I was wrong.  I used a pork roast and layered the bottom of my nice, new, huge crockpot with onions.  I got a late start on this and found that it cooked just as well on high for 6 hours, with another hour soaking in the sauce on the warm setting.  I did substitute half a bottle of mexican beer for the ginger ale, as I didn't have any and we thought it gave it the nicest hint of hmmm...  Served over sliced bread.  You made me a rock star, thanks!"
97579,131018,2008-01-07,5,"I've never made pulled pork before and this is excellent!  I realized this morning I forgot to take out the pork loin from the freezer last night, so I hurried and threw (4.5 lb loin) it in the crockpot around 9:30 a.m. on high and by 3:30 it was perfect!  I then shredded it, added the BBQ and I'm sitting here right now enjoying it.  Thanks!

P.S.  I didn't have ginger ale so I threw in a can of beer with it and it was fine."
64583,131018,2008-01-11,5,"This is awesome!  A friend recommended it to me and I'm so glad that I tried it.  I used beer in lieu of ginger ale and it worked very well.  This just couldn't be any easier or more delicious.  We served it on crusty rolls alongside baked potatoes and steamed green beans.  I did adjust the cooking time by cooking the pork on high for 7 hours, then after shredding and adding the sauce I put it back in the crockpot on low for 2 1/2 hours.  This is a fabulous recipe that I'm sure to make many times."
58836,131018,2008-01-30,5,"Made for a birthday celebration and it turned out really good.  I used sprite instead of ginger ale and used more because my butt was bigger(no punt intended, ha)  Anyway got rave reviews from all guests.  Thanks and I'm sure I will make again."
55578,131018,2008-04-08,5,"Easy, easy!  I didn't have ginger ale so I found some British beer ??? in the fridge and used that.  I thawed my 6 lb butt (lol) in the microwave and threw it in the crock pot partially frozen and cooked it on high for 6 hrs, shredded it and cooked it on low for an hour.  I used the large bottle of Baby Ray's, but thought there was too much sauce, probably because I didn't let it simmer for longer.  My family felt that Baby Ray's was a little too sweet for this dish.  So I will use something else for the BBQ sauce."
140132,131018,2008-06-04,4,This was good.  I liked the flavor from the ginger ale on the pork.  The meat was very tender and moist.  Thank you for posting....Stephanie
357358,131018,2008-06-24,5,"It definitely doesn't get much easier to throw together in the morning than this. Flexible flavor since you add your favorite sauce. Because this was a workday, I simply removed the roast after 10 hours of cooking and shredded it. Chopped up the onions and mixed them along with the BBQ sauce into the shredded meat. Tasted great and I have plenty for another meal and to freeze. Thanks!"
394077,131018,2008-07-31,5,"So easy and very good.  I only had Kraft BBQ sauce which wasn't my favorite but  it still came out delish.  The next time,  I will use better BBQ sauce. Also,  I added 1/4 cup of chili sauce to give it more flavor.  So good with fresh buns.  Thanks."
218535,131018,2008-08-01,5,Very good. I used coca-cola instead of gingerale because that's what I have.
175824,131018,2008-11-12,5,"This was so easy. I did not have any ginger ale so I use some Budwiser. Other than the Budwiser, I followed the recipe exactly. I had to cut a little fat off that did not melt away. I also used Jack Daniels #7 sauce. It was delicious. I had to add more than one bottle of sauce. I made small portions and froze them individually.  You are right. They do freeze wonderfully. The house smelled so-o-o-o good while this was cooking. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I plan on making some more and taking it in to work."
189475,131018,2008-12-01,5,"This was delicious and so easy to make. I used diet ginger ale, because I only drink diet soda and I didn't want the rest of the bottle to go to waste, and it worked just fine. I made it with honey BBQ sauce which worked really well. I only cooked it for 10 hours before adding the BBQ sauce, and 3 hours after, and it was plenty of time. It was so easy to shred the meat, especially since the meat was already falling off of the bones and all I had to do was pick out the bones. I will definitely be making this again!"
173579,131018,2008-12-30,5,I made this for a get together last night at my house.  Everybody just raved about it.  I will be using this from now on.  Great potluck meal!  Thanks for sharing.
285039,131018,2009-02-26,5,This was so quick and easy to make...that my DH made it!  (Teeheehee -- actually he is pretty handy in the kitchen).  We used Damon's BBQ sauce and it turned out fabulous!  Served the sandwiches with a layer of slaw...yummy!
145352,131018,2009-03-23,5,Loved it. Allow a lot of time!
195589,131018,2009-03-27,5,"Made this a few weeks ago, everyone loved it! This was my first time making pulled pork, I used the shoulder cut. I was worried about the skin and the bone, but after straining, all that was left was the meat. I used 3 onions and added some spices as well. Like others, after shredding, I only cooked for 1 1/2 hours and it was perfect! Thanks for posting duonyte."
88099,131018,2009-05-17,4,"This was very good. I had 3 pounds of pork tenderloin roast that I used. I left the fat strap on, but it still got very dry. I cooked it for 8 hours and then an hour and a half with the barbecue sauce. I used recipe #123417 for the sauce. Will have to adjust the cooking times for my very large crockpot. Thanks for sharing. Made for Zaar Stars."
350750,131018,2009-05-31,5,"WOW, that's all I have to say! Loved the taste also how easy it was to prepare.  I took it to a family gathering and everybody seemed to like it! I'll keep this handy! Maybe next time I'll have enough to freeze :)"
59163,131018,2009-10-27,4,My son and his wife are in the middle of remodeling their kitchen.  We have been helping every weekend.  I brought all the ingredients and made this last weekend.  Super quick to put together with very yummy results.  Everyone enjoyed it! We had it with cole slaw.  I am going to make this again and again.
808027,131018,2009-11-15,5,Fantastic!  So easy and so tasty.  Definitely use the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce...it makes this dish.
158086,131018,2010-01-10,5,I used a can of beer instead of ginger ale and I used Brownwood Farms Cherry BBQ Sauce and it was outstanding!....Mine cooked alot faster than stated in the recipe but I have a big Cuisinart Slow cooker and it always cooks way faster then the others...Great recipe!
353131,131018,2010-02-20,5,Made this a couple of months ago and forgo to rate it! This was absolutely the best pulled pork we have EVER had!!!Used homemade BBQ sauce recipe from here on zaar.
305531,131018,2010-03-12,5,Yum! This was simple and very tasty. I used a hickory smoke barbecue sauce that was nice. Thanks duonyte for a new keeper. Made for Gimme 5 Tag.
1581225,131018,2010-04-08,5,"Very tender and tasty, my husband loves this! So easy too. I put it on before I go to bed, pull it apart in the morning, then it can be ready for lunch or dinner that day. Leftovers freeze very well. Excellent recipe, thanks!"
937635,131018,2010-06-05,5,Fab Pulled Pork recipe! And soooo easy! I used a bottle of Saz's and thought the flavor was spot-on. We have four others over (total of 6) and we ate the WHOLE Thing! Thanks so much for a keeper!
185446,131018,2010-06-27,5,"Talk about an easy recipe! 268 good reviews don't lie--I followed directions, but utilized comments to shorten cooking time--overnight for 12 hours and about an hour more after adding the barbeque sauce.  Turned out great.  Thanks for a foolproof recipe."
789516,131018,2010-07-05,5,So easy and delicious.  Cut cooking time a bit by cooking on high part of the time.
98919,131018,2010-08-11,5,This is the recipe my daughter-in-law makes and everyone always raves over it.  I finally made it myself and couldn't believe how easy it was to make.  I used COKE instead of ginger ale because that is what I had on hand.  I cooked it about 11 1/2 hours then shredded and added BBQ sauce as directed but put into the fridge overnight.  The next day I cooked it another 3 hours and it was to-die-for!!  Ummm some good cole slaw on top would be the perfect sandwich.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!
333017,131018,2010-08-23,5,"Devine!  The onions are choice...so next time I will add as many as the crock pot can hold!  Yum!!!  I used one of Kittencal's bbq sauces and it tasted really, really good.  Yes it is time consuming, but the result is way worth it!  I served it with a cabbage/broccoli coleslaw that I made.  I would make this again in a flash!  Kudos on the posting!!!"
138429,131018,2010-08-31,5,Excellent!!!! Served with fresh buns. Ditto to all the other excellent reviews.
232480,131018,2010-10-15,5,"This was so, so good, although I modified it quite a bit.  I completely forgot about the onions, I've no idea why, but I never sliced them and didn't even think about it until I saw them sitting on the counter hours later.  I didn't have ginger ale, but I had Dr. Pepper, so I used a 3.75 pound boneless pork shoulder and 1 can of Dr. Pepper and cooked on low for 10 hours.  I removed the pork, shredded it, bagged it and threw it in the fridge.  I discarded the cooking liquid.  The day I needed it (I was cooking ahead for my daughter's birthday party) I tossed it back in the crockpot and mixed in the barbecue sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's).  It seemed kind of dry so I added a bit of Sprite (again, it's what I had), maybe 1/4 c. or so, just to moisten it up a bit.  Warmed through and served.  It was so good, such a hit, and EVERYONE ate it (all the guests plus my toddlers!).  Definitely keeping this recipe, and will make again and again!"
37305,131018,2010-10-30,5,"I've made this several times and everyone loves it.  The recipe has been passed around many times and is requested often for birthday dinners and parties.  Sometimes I need to add extra Sweet Baby Ray's, but other than that, it's perfect as written.  Thanks!"
262312,131018,2010-11-16,5,fantastic!!  i used this method instead of my smoker since it's snowing so hard outside.  only change i made was to use beer instead of ginger ale since that's what i had on hand.  used sweet baby ray's too.
226863,131018,2010-12-15,5,"This is very good, but not quite as good as the one I make with Pepsi....but that could be because that is what I am used to.  I cooked my pork butt on low for 10 hours, then shredded and added the barbecue sauce for 2 hours.  It would have been overcooked and dry if I had cooked it longer.  But I did cook in a newer crockpot.....I think if I'd made it in a cylinder shaped older crockpot, I'd need to cook it longer.  But I also think the older models cook more evenly and would have kept it more moist.  I love to do this when I can't smoke my pork butt on the grill, and it is wonderful to take to sell at little league concession stands and high school concession stands...stays hot and you can sell a lot of sandwiches!!  Thanks for posting this."
47907,131018,2011-01-07,5,Love this recipe!!!  DH is a HUGE fan of pulled pork and he wanted this several days in a row.  I made as posted and it is very easy.  Thanks so much for posting a keeper!!
439797,131018,2011-01-29,5,I've tried a lot of pulled pork recipes and this is my new favorite. Used a boneless pork roast.  Cooked from about 8 until 5.
133174,131018,2013-01-28,5,"This is on my menu for game day!  I made this the other day and everyone really loved it.  Changes?  I used a lean pork roast, 1/2 a bottle of sauce and cooked it on low for about 5 to 6 hours.  After the pork was pulled the additional 1/2 bottle sauce and about 1 cup of the cooking liquid was poured over the meat and finished the cooking process.  So simple and so utterly yummy."
39835,131018,2013-06-22,5,We loved this - used diet ginger ale but other wise followed the recipe as written -- only cooked for 8 hours before shredding on adding bq sauce and cooked for another 4 1/2 hours or so. My butt roast was 4 1/2 pounds which was on sale and this was the perfect way to use it! Thanks for sharing!
389431,131018,2013-08-11,0,"This is a great recipe! Used pork loin as it was all I could find and Stubbs BBQ sauce. Cooked on high for 7 hours, added the sauce, cooked on high for another 3... Served with hoagie rolls and broccoli slaw. Yummmmmmmmmm!&lt;br/&gt;Freezing 1/2 for a quick meal in the future. Thanks!"
307214,131018,2013-10-11,5,Followed the recipe using Original Bulls Eye BBQ sauce and cooked this the day before.  Put in the fridge overnight and was able to scrape a HUGE amount of fat off the next day.  Tried to reheat in the crock pot but 2 hours was not long enough to get the meat hot (mine is an older model)... ended up using the microwave.  Highly recommend this recipe and making it a day before.
1133190,131018,2013-11-16,5,"I thought I had reviewed this a long time ago!?! I make this recipe several times a year.  Its great! Moist, tasty and freezes well! My husband loves using these sandwiches for lunch.  I tried it one time with beer instead of ginger ale, and that was great too, but usually I use ginger ale."
198154,131018,2014-07-02,4,"Made this just as it is written.  For the &quot;favorite&quot; barbeque sauce we used Dinosaur, a locally famous sauce from the Syracuse NY area.  Lots of leftovers. So we will freeze it for another meal.  Thanks for the easy crock pot recipe!"
400708,131018,2014-07-15,5,I&#039;ll just add my 5 stars to this easy recipe.  Needed something to go with my homemade pretzel rolls and this sounded so easy it was perfect.  Followed the directions and even my picky grandkids loved it after tasting and didn&#039;t leave a bit on the plate.
